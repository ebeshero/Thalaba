      <encodingDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>Encoded with careful attention to the semantic association of text and paratext structures. Southey's paratext notes are encoded as hierarchical descendants of the line-group or other portion of Southey's main text on the spot where they are signalled. This is not only conformant with TEI standard practice but also is designed to help investigate semantic interlinkage of text and paratext in this heavily annotated epic poem. Encoding of proper names, especially places, people, and collectives is designed to trace associations made between text and paratext. References to places in the main text are encoded to determine whether they are mentioned literally, as places visited by the characters in the poem, or imagined referentially by analogy.</p>
            <p>This edition does not, however, attempt to reproduce the title page or page layout of the 1801 edition. Instead, the TEI is prepared to be the basis of a digital edition optimized for viewing text and paratext in association on a computer screen. This encoding responds to the print edition's layout of footnotes positioned beneath the main text, and is intended to assist experimental screen layouts that preserve this association of text and paratext.</p>

         <change when="2017-05-07" resp="#ebb">Revised this header to include a proper revisionDesc changelog. Edited file to represent Center for the Digital Text as sponsoring organization. Added a front element to move prefatory material inside in the single-file edition to improve TEI conformance. Also prepared the original single-file edition to be transformed into a collection of smaller files for ease of processing. Added @xml:ids to number the volume divs.</change>
         <change when="2016" resp="#ebb">Added attributes to distinguish between analogous places and literal physical movement of characters, and wrote Schemtaron rules to control this.</change>

                              <p> One of the Arabs whom we saw from afar, and who was mounted upon a
                                 Camel, seemed higher than a tower and to be moving in the air, at
                                 first this was to me a strange appearance, however it was only the

                                 this phenomenon, and I afterwards saw many appearances exactly

                              <p> One of these <hi rend="italic">Hykes</hi> is usually six yards
                                 long and 5 or 6 foot broad, serving the Arab for a compleat dress
                                 in the day, and for his bed and covering in the night. It is a
                                 loose but troublesome kind of garment, being frequently
                                 disconcerted and falling upon the ground, so that the person who
                                 wears it, is every moment obliged to tuck it up, and fold it anew
                                 about his body. This shews the great use there is for a girdle in
                                 attending any active employment, and in consequence thereof, the
                                 force of the scripture injunction alluding thereunto, of <hi rend="italic">having our loyns girded</hi>. The method of
                                 wearing these garments, with the use they are at other times put
                                 to, in serving for coverlets to their beds, should induce us to
                                 take the finer sort of them at least, such as are wore by the
                                 Ladies and persons of distinction, to be the <hi rend="italic">peplus</hi> of the antients. It is very probable likewise, that
                                 the loose folding garment, (the <hi rend="italic">Toga</hi> I take
                                 it to be) of the Romans, was of this kind: for if the drapery of
                                 their statues is to instruct us, this is actually no other than
                                 what the Arabs appear in, when they are folded up in their <hi rend="italic">Hykes</hi>. Instead of the <hi rend="italic">fibula</hi>, they join together, with thread or a wooden
                                 bodkin, the two upper corners of this garment, which being first
                                 placed over one of their shoulders, they fold the rest of it
                                 afterwards round their bodies. <bibl>Shaw.</bibl>

                              <p> The employment of the women is to prepare their wool, spin, and
                                 weave in looms hung lengthways in their tents. These looms are
                                 formed by a list of an ell and a half long, to which the threads of
                                 the warp are fixed at one end, and at the other on a roller of
                                 equal length; the weight of which, being suspended, keeps them
                                 stretched. The threads of the warp are so hung as to be readily
                                 intersected. Instead of shuttles, the women pass the thread of the
                                 woof thro' the warp with their fingers, and with an iron comb,
                                 having a handle, press the woof to give a body to their cloth. Each
                                 piece of about 5 ells long, and an ell and a half wide, is called a
                                    <hi rend="italic">haick</hi>; it receives neither dressing,
                                 milling nor dying, but is immediately fit for use: it is the

                                 fashion. When dirty it is washed: the Moor is wrapped up in it day
                                 and night, and this <hi rend="italic">haick</hi> is the living

                                 <persName ref="Anchietus">Anchieta</persName> was going in a canoe
                                 to the mouth of the <placeName>river Aldea</placeName>, a
                                 delightful spot, surrounded with mango trees, and usually abounding
                                 with birds called goarazes, that breed there. These birds are about
                                 the size of a hen, their colour a rich purple, inclining to red.
                                 They are white when hatched, and soon become black, but as they
                                 grow larger lose that colour and take this rich and beautiful
                                 purple. Our navigators had reached the place, but when they should
                                 have enjoyed the fine prospect which delights all who pass it, the
                                 sun was excessively hot, and this eye-pleasure was purchased dearly
                                 when the whole body was in a profuse perspiration, and the rowers
                                 were in a fever. Their distress called upon Joseph, and the remedy
                                 was no new one to him. He saw three or four of these birds perched
                                 upon a mango, and <rs type="place" subtype="language" ref="Brazil">calling to them in the Brazilian language</rs> which the rowers
                                 understood, said, go you, call your companions, and come to shade
                                 these hot servants of the Lord. The birds stretched out their necks
                                 as if in obedience, and away they went to seek for others, and in a
                                 short time they came flying in the shape of an elegant cloud, and
                                 they shadowed the canoe a good league out to sea till the fresh sea
                                 breeze sprung up. Then they told them they might go about their
                                 business, and they separated with a clamor of rude but joyful
                                 sounds, which were only understood by <name type="divin">the Author
                                    of Nature</name> who created them. This was a greater miracle

                                 the faster the Camels go, and they stop as soon as he ceases to
                                 sing. The Camel-drivers to relieve each other sing alternately, and
                                 when they wish their beasts to brouze for half an hour on what they
                                 can find, they amuse themselves by smoking a pipe, after which

                                 filled our hearts with a very short-lived joy. The whole plain
                                 before us seemed thick covered with green grass and yellow daisies.
                                 We advanced to the place with as much speed as our lame condition
                                 would suffer us, but how terrible was our disapointment, when we
                                 found the whole of that verdure to consist in senna and
                                 coloquintida, the most nauseous of plants, and the most incapable

                              <p> On the road we passed the skeleton of a camel, which now and then
                                 happens in <rs type="place" ref="desert">the desert</rs>. These are
                                 poor creatures that have perished with fatigue: for those which are
                                 killed for the sustenance of the Arabs, are carried away bones and
                                 all together. Of the hides are made the soles of the slippers which
                                 are worn in <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, without any dressing, but
                                 what the sun can give them. The circumstances of this animal's
                                 death, when his strength fails him on the road, have something in
                                 them affecting to humanity. Such are his patience and perseverance,
                                 that he pursues his journey without flagging, as long as he has
                                 power to support its weight; and such are his fortitude and spirit,
                                 that he will never give out, until nature sinks beneath the
                                 complicated ills which press upon him. Then, and then only, will he
                                 resign his burden and body to the ground. Nor stripes, nor caresses
                                 nor food, nor rest, will make him rise again! His vigor is
                                 exhausted, and life ebbs out apace! This the Arabs are very
                                 sensible of, and kindly plunge a sword into the breast of the dying
                                 beast, to shorten his pangs. Even the Arab feels remorse when he
                                 commits this deed: his hardened heart is moved at the loss of a
                                 faithful servant. <bibl>Eyles Irwin.</bibl>

                                 animal is very ill qualified to travel upon the snow or wet ground;
                                 the breadth in which they carry their legs, when they slip, often
                                 occasions their splitting themselves; so that when they fall with
                                 great burdens they seldom rise again." <bibl>Jonas Hanway.</bibl>

                              <p> No creature seems so peculiarly fitted to the climate in which it
                                 exists. We cannot doubt the nature of the one has been adapted to
                                 that of the other by some <hi rend="italic">disposing
                                    intelligence</hi>. Designing the Camel to dwell in a country
                                 where he can find little nourishment, <name type="myth">Nature</name> has been sparing of her materials in the whole of
                                 his formation, She has not bestowed upon him the plump fleshiness
                                 of the ox, horse, or elephant; but limiting herself to what is
                                 strictly necessary, she has given him a small head without ears, at
                                 the end of a long neck without flesh. She has taken from his legs
                                 and thighs every muscle not immediately resquisite for motion; and
                                 in short has bestowed on his withered body only the vessels and
                                 tendons necessary to connect his frame together. She has furnished
                                 him with a strong jaw, that he may grind the hardest aliments; but
                                 lest he should consume too much, she has contracted his stomach,
                                 and obliged him to chew the cud. She has lined his foot with a lump
                                 of flesh, which, sliding in the mud, and being no way adapted for
                                 climbing, fits him only for a dry, level, and sandy soil, like that
                                 of <placeName>Arabia</placeName>. She has evidently destined him
                                 likewise to slavery, by refusing him every sort of defence against
                                 his enemies. Destitute of the horns of the bull, the hoofs of the
                                 horse, the tooth of the elephant, and the swiftness of the stag,
                                 how can the camel resist or avoid the attacks of the lion, the
                                 tyger, or even the wolf? To preserve the species therefore, <name type="myth">Nature</name> has concealed him in the depths of the
                                    <rs type="place" ref="desert">vast deserts</rs>, where the want
                                 of vegetables can attract no game, and whence the want of game
                                 repels every voracious animal. Tyranny must have expelled man from
                                 the habitable parts of <placeName ref="Earth_planet">the

                                 Become domestic, he has rendered habitable the most barren soil
                                    <placeName ref="the_world">the world</placeName> contains. He
                                 alone supplies all his master's wants. The milk of the Camel
                                 nourishes the family of the Arab, under the various forms of curds,
                                 cheese, and butter; and they often feed upon his flesh. Slippers
                                 and harness are made of his skin, and tents and clothing of his
                                 hair. Heavy burthens are transported by his means, and when the
                                 earth denies forage to the horse, so valuable to the Bedouin, the
                                 she-camel supplies that deficiency by her milk, at no other cost,
                                 for so many advantages, than a few stalks of brambles or wormwood,
                                 and pounded date kernels. So great is the importance of the Camel
                                 to the desert, that were it deprived of that useful animal, it must
                                 infallibly lose every inhabitant. <bibl>Volney.</bibl>

                                 Camels. This seeming collection of water, always advances, about a

                                 disappointment; but when their distress and misery has reached
                                 extremity, suddenly relieving them from the dark windings of
                                 confusion and error, she conducts them to the fountains of

                              <p> "I pushed on as fast as possible, in hopes of reaching some
                                 watering-place in the course of the night. My thirst was by this
                                 time become insufferable; my mouth was parched and inflamed; a
                                 sudden dimness would frequently come over my eyes, with other
                                 symptoms of fainting; and my horse being very much fatigued, I
                                 began seriously to apprehend that I should perish of thirst. To
                                 relieve the burning pain in my mouth and throat, I chewed the
                                 leaves of different shrubs, but found them all bitter and of no
                                 service to me. </p>
                              <p> A little before sunset, having reached the top of a gentle rising,
                                 I climbed a high tree, from the topmost branches of which I cast a
                                 melancholy look over the barren wilderness, but without discovering
                                 the most distant trace of a human dwelling. The same dismal
                                 uniformity of shrubs and sand every where presents itself, and the
                                 horizon, was as level and uninterrupted as that of the sea. </p>
                              <p> Descending from the tree, I found my horse devouring the stubble
                                 and brushwood with great avidity; and as I was now too faint to
                                 attempt walking, and my horse too much fatigued to carry me, I
                                 thought it but an act of humanity, and perhaps the last I should
                                 ever have it in my power to perform, to take off his bridle and let
                                 him shift for himself: in doing which I was suddenly affected with
                                 sickness and giddiness, and falling upon the sand, felt as if the
                                 hour of death was fast approaching. Here then, thought I, after a
                                 short but ineffectual struggle, terminate all my hopes of being
                                 useful in my day and generation; here must the short span of my
                                 life come to an end.—I cast (as I believed) a last look on the
                                 surrounding scene, and whilst I reflected on the awful change that
                                 was about to take place, <placeName ref="the_world">this
                                    world</placeName> with its enjoyments seemed to vanish from my
                                 recollection. <name type="myth">Nature</name> however, at length
                                 resumed its functions; and on recovering my senses, I found myself
                                 stretched upon the sand with the bridle still in my hand, and the
                                 sun just sinking behind the trees. I now summoned all my
                                 resolution, and determined to make another effort to prolong my
                                 existence. And as the evening was somewhat cool, I resolved to
                                 travel as far as my limbs would carry me, in hopes of reaching (my
                                 only resource) a watering place. With this view I put the bridle on
                                 my horse, and driving him before me, went slowly along for about an
                                 hour, when I perceived some lightning from the north east, a most
                                 delightful sight, for it promised rain. The darkness and lightning
                                 increased very rapidly; and in less than an hour I heard the wind
                                 roaring among the bushes. I had already opened my mouth to receive
                                 the refreshing drops which I expected, but I was instantly covered
                                 with a cloud of sand, driven with such force by the wind as to give
                                 a very disagreeable sensation to my face and arms, and I was
                                 obliged to mount my horse and stop under a bush, to prevent being
                                 suffocated. The sand continued to fly in amazing quantities for
                                 near an hour, after which I again set forward, and travelled with
                                 difficulty, until ten o'clock. About this time I was agreeably
                                 surprized by some very vivid flashes of lightning, followed by a
                                 few heavy drops of rain. In a little time the sand ceased to fly,
                                 and I alighted, and spread out all my clean clothes to collect the
                                 rain, which at length I saw would certainly fall.—For more than an
                                 hour it rained plentifully, and I quenched my thirst, by wringing
                                 and sucking my clothes. <bibl>Park's Travels in the Interior of

                                 three or four Dromedaries. These the Arabs call Mehera, the
                                 singular is Meheri. They are of several sorts, and degrees of
                                 value, some worth many common Camels, others scarce worth two or
                                 three. To look on, they seem little different from the rest of that
                                 Species, only I think the Excrescence on a Dromedary's Back is
                                 somewhat less than that of a Camel. What is reported of their

                                 no Fable. The longer they lie so, the more excellent they prove in
                                 their Kind, and consequently of higher Price and Esteem. None lie
                                 in that Trance more than ten Days and Nights. These that do, are
                                 pretty rare, and are called Ashari from Aashara, which signifies
                                 ten in Arabick. I saw one such, perfectly white all over, belonging
                                 to Lella Oumane Princess of that noble Arab Neja, named Hayl ben
                                 Ali, I spoke of, and upon which she put a very great Value, never

                                 swiftness, for more ordinary Messages. They say that one of these
                                 Aasharies will, in one Night, and thro' a level Country, traverse
                                 as much Ground as any single Horse can perform in ten, which is no

                                 Hard Trot, for four and twenty Hours upon a Stretch without shewing

                              <p> I happened to be, once in particular, at the Tent of that
                                 Princess, with Ali ben Mahamoud, the Bey, or Vice-Roy of the
                                 Algerine Eastern Province, when he went thither to celebrate his
                                 Nuptials with Ambarca, her only Daughter, if I mistake not. Among
                                 other Entertainments she gave her Guests, the favourite white
                                 Dromedary was brought forth, ready Saddled and Bridled. I say
                                 Bridled, because the Thong, which serves instead of a Bridle, was
                                 put thro' the Hole purposely made in the Gristle of the Creature's
                                 Nose. The Arab appointed to mount, was straightly laced, from the
                                 very Loins quite to his Throat, in a strong Leathern Jacket; they
                                 never riding these Animals any otherwise accoutred, so impetuously
                                 violent are the Concussions the Rider undergoes, during that rapid
                                 Motion, that were he to be loose. I much question whether a few
                                 Hours such unintermitting Agitation would not endanger the bursting
                                 of some of his Entrails: And this the Arabs scruple not to
                                 acknowledge. We were to be diverted with seeing this fine Ashari
                                 run against some of the swiftest Barbs in the whole Neja, which is
                                 famed for having good ones, of the true Libyan Breed, shaped like
                                 Greyhounds, and which will sometimes run down an Ostridge; which
                                 few of the very best can pretend to do, especially upon a hard
                                 Ground, perfectly level. We all started like Racers, and for the
                                 first Spurt, most of the best mounted among us kept up pretty well,
                                 but our Grass fed Horses soon flagged: Several of the Libyan and
                                 Numidian Runners held Pace till we, who still followed upon a good
                                 round Hand Gallop, could no longer discern them, and then gave out;
                                 as we were told after their Return. When the Dromedary had been out
                                 of our Sight about half an Hour, we again espied it flying towards
                                 us with an amazing Volocity, and in a very few Moments was among
                                 us, and seemingly nothing concerned; while the Horses and Mares
                                 were all on a Foam, and scarce able to breathe, as was, likewise, a
                                 fleet, tall Greyhound Bitch, of the young Prince's, who had
                                 followed and kept Pace the whole Time, and was no sooner got back
                                 to us, but lay down panting as if ready to expire. I cannot tell
                                 how many Miles we went; but we were near three Hours in coming
                                 leisurely back to the Tents, yet made no Stop in the Way. The young
                                 Prince Hamet ben al Guydom ben Sakhari, and his younger Brother
                                 Messoud, told their new Brother-in-Law, that they defied all the
                                 Potentates of <placeName>Africa</placeName> to shew him such an
                                 Ashari; and the Arab who rode it, challenged the Bey to lay his
                                 Lady a Wager of 1000 Ducats, that he did not bring him an Answer to
                                 a Letter from the Prince of Wargala, in less than four Days, tho'
                                 Leo Africanus, Marmol, and several others assure us, that it is no
                                 less than forty Spanish Leagues, of four Miles each, South of
                                 Tuggurt to which Place, upon another Occasion, as I shall observe,
                                 we made six tedious Days March from the Neighbourhood of Biscara,
                                 North of which we were then, at least thirty Hours riding, if I
                                 remember rightly. However the Bey, who was a Native of Biscara, and
                                 consequently well acquainted with the Sahara, durst not take him
                                 up. By all Circumstances, and the Description given us, besides
                                 what I know of the Matter my self, it could not be much less than
                                 400 Miles, and as many back again, the fellow offered to ride, in
                                 so short a Time; nay many other Arabs boldly proffered to venture
                                 all they were worth in <placeName ref="the_world">the

                              <p> Chenier says "the Dromedary can travel 60 leagues in a day, his
                                 motion is so rapid that the rider is obliged to be girthed to the
                                 saddle, and to have a handkerchief before his mouth to break the
                                 current of the wind."—These accounts are probably much exaggerated. </p>

                              <p> We were here at once surprised and terrified by a sight surely the
                                 most magnificent in <placeName ref="the_world">the
                                    world</placeName>. In that vast expanse of <rs type="place" ref="desert">desert</rs>, from W. and to N. W. of us, we saw a
                                 number of prodigious pillars of sand at different distances, at
                                 times moving with great celerity, at others stalking with a
                                 majestic slowness: at intervals we thought they were coming in a
                                 very few moments to overwhelm us, and small quantities of sand did
                                 actually more than once reach us. Again they would retreat so as to
                                 be almost out of sight, their tops reaching to the very clouds.
                                 There the tops often separated from the bodies, and these once
                                 disjoined, dispersed in the air and did not appear more. Sometimes
                                 they were broken near the middle, as if struck with a large cannon
                                 shot. About noon they began to advance with considerable swiftness
                                 upon us, the wind being very strong at north. Eleven of them ranged
                                 alongside of us about the distance of three miles. The greatest
                                 diameter of the largest appeared to me at that distance as if it
                                 would measure ten feet. They retired from us with a wind at S. E.
                                 leaving an impression upon my mind to which I can give no name;
                                 though surely one ingredient in it was fear, with a considerable
                                 deal of wonder and astonishment. It was in vain to think of flying,
                                 the swiftest horse, or fastest sailing ship could be of no use to
                                 carry us out of this danger, and the full persuasion of this
                                 rivetted me as if to the spot where I stood. </p>
                              <p> On the 15th the same appearance of moving pillars of sand
                                 presented themselves to us, only they seemed to be more in number,
                                 and less in size. They came several times in a direction close upon
                                 us; that is, I believe, within less than two miles. They began
                                 immediately after sun-rise, like a thick wood, and almost darkened
                                 the sun. His rays shining through them for near an hour, gave them
                                 an appearance of pillars of fire. Our people now became desperate:
                                 the Greeks shrieked out, and said it was the day of judgement.
                                 Ismael pronounced it to be <rs type="metaplace" subtype="divin" ref="Hell">hell</rs>, and the Tucorories that <placeName ref="the_world">the world</placeName> was on fire.
