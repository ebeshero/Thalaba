      <encodingDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>Encoded with careful attention to the semantic association of text and paratext structures. Southey's paratext notes are encoded as hierarchical descendants of the line-group or other portion of Southey's main text on the spot where they are signalled. This is not only conformant with TEI standard practice but also is designed to help investigate semantic interlinkage of text and paratext in this heavily annotated epic poem. Encoding of proper names, especially places, people, and collectives is designed to trace associations made between text and paratext. References to places in the main text are encoded to determine whether they are mentioned literally, as places visited by the characters in the poem, or imagined referentially by analogy.</p>
            <p>This edition does not, however, attempt to reproduce the title page or page layout of the 1801 edition. Instead, the TEI is prepared to be the basis of a digital edition optimized for viewing text and paratext in association on a computer screen. This encoding responds to the print edition's layout of footnotes positioned beneath the main text, and is intended to assist experimental screen layouts that preserve this association of text and paratext.</p>

         <change when="2017-05-07" resp="#ebb">Revised this header to include a proper revisionDesc changelog. Edited file to represent Center for the Digital Text as sponsoring organization. Added a front element to move prefatory material inside in the single-file edition to improve TEI conformance. Also prepared the original single-file edition to be transformed into a collection of smaller files for ease of processing. Added @xml:ids to number the volume divs.</change>
         <change when="2016" resp="#ebb">Added attributes to distinguish between analogous places and literal physical movement of characters, and wrote Schemtaron rules to control this.</change>

                                 very well ordered and very delicate. </p>

                                 <orgName>The Persians</orgName> use no knives at table, but the
                                 Cooks send up the meat ready cut up into little bits, so that it
                                 was no trouble to us to accustome ourselves to their manner of
                                 eating. Rice serves them instead of bread. They take a mouthful of
                                 it, with the two fore-fingers and the thumb, and so put it into
                                 their mouths. Every table had a carver, whom they call Suffret-zi,
                                 who takes the meat brought up in the great dishes, to put it into
                                 lesser ones, which he fills with 3 or 4 sorts of meat, so as that
                                 every dish may serve 2 or at most 3 persons. There was but little
                                 drunk till towards the end of the repast, and then the cups went
                                 about roundly, and the dinner was concluded with a vessel of
                                 porcelane, full of a hot blackish kind of drink, which they call
                                 Kahawa. <bibl>Ambassadors Travels.</bibl>

                              <p> They laid upon the floor of the Ambassadors room a fine silk
                                 cloth, on which there set <rs type="wealth">one and 30 dishes of

                                 some others not known in <placeName>Europe</placeName>. Some time
                                 after that cloth was taken away that another might be laid in the
                                 room of it, and upon this was set rice of all sorts of colours and

                                 all their dishes. They sometimes put thereto a little of the juice
                                 of pomegranates or cherries and saffron, insomuch that commonly you
                                 have rice of several colours in the same dish. <bibl>Amb.

                                 and serve for feeding Camels. But the proper melons are planted in
                                 the fields, where a great variety of them is to be found, and in
                                 such abundance, that <orgName>the Arabians</orgName> of all ranks
                                 use them, for some part of the year, as their principal article of
                                 food. They afford a very agreeable liquor. When its fruit is nearly
                                 ripe, a hole is pierced into the pulp, this hole is then stopped
                                 with wax, and the melon left upon the stalk. Within a few days the
                                 pulp is in consequence of this process, converted into a delicious

                                    four hours, and reckon them from one setting sun to another. As
                                    very few among them know what a watch is, and as they conceive,
                                    but imperfectly the duration of an hour, they usually determine
                                    time almost as when we say, it happened about noon, about
                                    evening, &amp;c. The moment when the Sun disappears is called
                                       <hi rend="italic">Maggrib</hi>, about two hours afterwards
                                    they call it <hi rend="italic">El ascha</hi>; two hours later,
                                       <hi rend="italic">El märfa</hi>; midnight <hi rend="italic">Nus el lejl</hi>: the dawn of morning <hi rend="italic">El

                                    eat about nine in the morning, and that meal is called <hi rend="italic">El ghadda</hi>; noon <hi rend="italic">El

                                    midnight are well ascertained; they both fall upon the twelfth
                                    hour. The others are earlier or later as the days are short or

                                 which always moves at a certain height in the atmosphere. Instinct

                              <p> Their heat is sometimes so excessive that it is difficult to form
                                 any idea of its violence without having experienced it; but it may
                                 be compared to the heat of a large oven at the moment of drawing
                                 out the bread. When these winds begin to blow, the atmosphere
                                 assumes an alarming aspect. The sky at other times so clear, in
                                 this climate, becomes dark and heavy; the sun loses his splendour
                                 and appears of a violet colour. The air is not cloudy, but grey and
                                 thick, and is in fact filled with an extremely subtile dust, which
                                 penetrates every where. This wind, always light and rapid, is not
                                 at first remarkably hot, but it increases in heat in proportion as
                                 it continues. All animated bodies soon discover it, by the change
                                 it produces in them. The lungs which a too rarefied air no longer
                                 expands, are contracted and become painful. Respiration is short
                                 and difficult, the skin parched and dry, and the body consumed by
                                 an internal heat. In vain is recourse had to large draughts of
                                 water; nothing can restore perspiration. In vain is coolness sought
                                 for; all bodies in which it is usual to find it, deceives the hand
                                 that touches them. <rs type="science" subtype="phys">Marble, iron,
                                    water, notwithstanding the sun no longer appears, are hot.</rs>
                                 The streets are deserted, and the dead silence of night reigns
                                 every where. <orgName>The inhabitants of houses and
                                    villages</orgName> shut themselves up in their houses, and those
                                 of <rs type="place" ref="desert">the desert</rs> in their tents, or
                                 in <rs type="earthworks" subtype="mine">pits they dig in the
                                    earth</rs>, where they wait the termination of this destructive
                                 heat. It usually <time>lasts three days</time>, but if it exceeds
                                 that time it becomes insupportable. Woe to <rs type="person">the
                                    traveller</rs> whom this wind surprizes remote from shelter! he
                                 must suffer all its dreadful consequences which sometimes are
                                 mortal. The danger is most imminent when it blows in squalls, for
                                 then the rapidity of the wind increases the heat to such degree as
                                 to cause sudden death. This death is a real suffocation; the lungs
                                 being empty, are convulsed, the circulation disordered, and the
                                 whole mass of blood driven by the heart towards the head and
                                 breast; whence that hæmorrhage at the nose and mouth which happens
                                 after death. This wind is especially fatal to <orgName>persons of a
                                    plethoric habit</orgName>, and those in whom fatigue has
                                 destroyed the tone of the muscles and the vessels. The corpse
                                 remains a long time warm, swells, turns blue and is easily
                                 separated; all which are signs of that putrid fermentation which
                                 takes place in animal bodies when the humours become stagnant.
                                 These accidents are to be avoided by stopping the nose and mouth
                                 with handkerchiefs; an efficacious method likewise is that
                                 practised by the camels, who bury their noses in the sand and keep
                                 them there till the squall is over. </p>
                              <p> Another quality of this wind is its extreme aridity; which is
                                 such, that water sprinkled on the floor evaporates in a few
                                 minutes. By this extreme dryness it withers and strips all the
                                 plants, and by exhaling too suddenly the emanations from animal
                                 bodies, crisps the skin, closes the pores, and causes that feverish
                                 heat which is the invariable effect of suppressed perspiration. <bibl>
