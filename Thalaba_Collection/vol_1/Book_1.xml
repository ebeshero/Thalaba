      <encodingDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>Encoded with careful attention to the semantic association of text and paratext structures. Southey's paratext notes are encoded as hierarchical descendants of the line-group or other portion of Southey's main text on the spot where they are signalled. This is not only conformant with TEI standard practice but also is designed to help investigate semantic interlinkage of text and paratext in this heavily annotated epic poem. Encoding of proper names, especially places, people, and collectives is designed to trace associations made between text and paratext. References to places in the main text are encoded to determine whether they are mentioned literally, as places visited by the characters in the poem, or imagined referentially by analogy.</p>
            <p>This edition does not, however, attempt to reproduce the title page or page layout of the 1801 edition. Instead, the TEI is prepared to be the basis of a digital edition optimized for viewing text and paratext in association on a computer screen. This encoding responds to the print edition's layout of footnotes positioned beneath the main text, and is intended to assist experimental screen layouts that preserve this association of text and paratext.</p>

         <change when="2017-05-07" resp="#ebb">Revised this header to include a proper revisionDesc changelog. Edited file to represent Center for the Digital Text as sponsoring organization. Added a front element to move prefatory material inside in the single-file edition to improve TEI conformance. Also prepared the original single-file edition to be transformed into a collection of smaller files for ease of processing. Added @xml:ids to number the volume divs.</change>
         <change when="2016" resp="#ebb">Added attributes to distinguish between analogous places and literal physical movement of characters, and wrote Schemtaron rules to control this.</change>

                                 <persName>Kail</persName> chose the black, which he imagined the

                                    would have them opened. They told him it could not possibly be
                                    done. He replied <rs type="person" ref="Almamon">I</rs> will
                                    have it certainly done. And that hole was opened for him, which
                                    stands open to this day, with fire and vinegar. <rs type="machine">Two smiths prepared and sharpened the iron and

                                       in the opening of it.</rs> The thickness of the wall was
                                    found to be twenty cubits; and when they came to the end of the
                                    wall, behind the place they had digged, there was <rs type="wealth">an ewer of green emerald; in it were a thousand

                                    </persName> said, cast up the account, how much hath been spent
                                    in making the entrance; they cast it up, and lo it was the same
                                    sum which they found, it neither exceeded nor was defective.
                                    Within they found a square well, in the square of it there were
                                    doors, every door opened into a house (or vault) in which there
                                    were dead bodies wrapped up in linen. They found towards the top

                                 its beams, it filled the surrounding air to a great distance with a

                                 love those of ample extent. It was of the utmost purity stained by
                                 no soil nor spot. Certain shape it had none, for its figure was
                                 inconstant and momentarily changing, and tho' at a distance it was
                                 beautiful to the eye, it would not suffer itself to be handled with
                                 impunity, but hurt those who obstinately struggled with it, as many
                                 persons before many spectators experienced. If by chance any part
                                 of it was broken off, for it was not very hard, it become nothing

                                    Monarch, whom he does not name, having erected a superb Palace,
                                    wished to show it to every man of talents and taste in the city;
                                    he therefore invited them to a banquet, and after the repast was
                                    finished asked them if they knew any building more magnificent
                                    and more perfect, in the architecture, in the ornaments and in
                                    the furniture.</rs> All the guests contented themselves with
                                 expressing their admiration, and lavishing praise, except one, who
                                 led a retired and austere life, and was one of those persons whom
                                    <orgName>the Arabians</orgName> call <persName>Zahed</persName>. </p>
                              <p> This man spoke very freely to the Prince and said to him, <rs type="building" subtype="palace">I find a great defect in this
                                    building, it is, that the foundation is not good, nor the walls
                                    sufficiently strong, so that <persName type="meta">Azrael</persName> can enter on every side, and the <name type="elemental">Sarsar</name> can easily pass thro'. And
                                    when they showed him the walls of the Palace ornamented with
                                    azure and gold, of which the marvellous workmanship surpassed in
                                    costliness the richness of the materials, he replied, there is
                                    still a great inconvenience here! it is that we can never
                                    estimate these works well, till we are laid backwards.</rs>
                                 Signifying by these words that we never understand these things
                                 rightly, till we are upon our death-bed, when we discover their
