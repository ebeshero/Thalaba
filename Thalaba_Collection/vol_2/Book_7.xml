      <encodingDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>Encoded with careful attention to the semantic association of text and paratext structures. Southey's paratext notes are encoded as hierarchical descendants of the line-group or other portion of Southey's main text on the spot where they are signalled. This is not only conformant with TEI standard practice but also is designed to help investigate semantic interlinkage of text and paratext in this heavily annotated epic poem. Encoding of proper names, especially places, people, and collectives is designed to trace associations made between text and paratext. References to places in the main text are encoded to determine whether they are mentioned literally, as places visited by the characters in the poem, or imagined referentially by analogy.</p>
            <p>This edition does not, however, attempt to reproduce the title page or page layout of the 1801 edition. Instead, the TEI is prepared to be the basis of a digital edition optimized for viewing text and paratext in association on a computer screen. This encoding responds to the print edition's layout of footnotes positioned beneath the main text, and is intended to assist experimental screen layouts that preserve this association of text and paratext.</p>

         <change when="2017-05-07" resp="#ebb">Revised this header to include a proper revisionDesc changelog. Edited file to represent Center for the Digital Text as sponsoring organization. Added a front element to move prefatory material inside in the single-file edition to improve TEI conformance. Also prepared the original single-file edition to be transformed into a collection of smaller files for ease of processing. Added @xml:ids to number the volume divs.</change>
         <change when="2016" resp="#ebb">Added attributes to distinguish between analogous places and literal physical movement of characters, and wrote Schemtaron rules to control this.</change>

                              <p> The whole chapter <hi rend="italic">de montibus</hi> is written
                                 with the eloquence of a Poet. Indeed Gibbon bestowed no exaggerated
                                 praise on Burnet in saying that he had "blended scripture, history,
                                 and tradition into one magnificent system, with a sublimity of
                                 imagination scarcely inferior to Milton himself." This work should
                                 be read in Latin, the Author's own translation is miserably
                                 inferior. He lived in the worst age of English prose.</p>

                                    <placeName>Damascus</placeName> with many other Arabian women,
                                 she excited them to mutiny, they seized the poles of the tents and
                                 attacked their captors. This bold resolution, says Marigny, was not
                                 inspired by impotent anger. Most of these women had military
                                 inclinations already; particularly those who were of the tribe of
                                 Hemiar or of the Homerites, where they are early exercised in
                                 riding the horse, and in using the bow, the lance, and the javelin.
                                 The revolt was successful, for during the engagement Derar came up
                                 to their assistance. <bibl>Marigny.</bibl>

                                    seeing himselfe thrust out of the paradise, would become so
                                    sorrowfull, that he could not in the world devise what to do, or
                                    whither to turne him. Then would he go unto the foresaide old

                                    paradise: who saith unto him, you cannot be admitted thither,
                                    unlesse you will slay such or such a man for my sake, and if you
                                    will give the attempt onely whether you kill him or no, I wil
                                    place you againe in paradise, that there you may remaine
                                    alwayes: then would the party without faile put the same in

                                    sayd olde man had conceived any hatred. And therefore all the

                                 he wolde putten hem into another Paradys, that was an 100 fold
                                 fairere than ony of the tothere: and there scholde thei dwellen

                                 and false cauteles. And whan the worthe men of the Contree hadden
                                 perceyved this sotylle falshod of this Gatholonabes, thei assembled
                                 hem with force, and assayleden his Castelle, and slowen him, and
                                 destroyden all the faire places, and alle the nobletees of that
                                 Paradys. The place of the welles and of the walles and of many
                                 other thinges bene zit apertly sene, but the richesse is voyded
