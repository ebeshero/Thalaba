      <encodingDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>Encoded with careful attention to the semantic association of text and paratext structures. Southey's paratext notes are encoded as hierarchical descendants of the line-group or other portion of Southey's main text on the spot where they are signalled. This is not only conformant with TEI standard practice but also is designed to help investigate semantic interlinkage of text and paratext in this heavily annotated epic poem. Encoding of proper names, especially places, people, and collectives is designed to trace associations made between text and paratext. References to places in the main text are encoded to determine whether they are mentioned literally, as places visited by the characters in the poem, or imagined referentially by analogy.</p>
            <p>This edition does not, however, attempt to reproduce the title page or page layout of the 1801 edition. Instead, the TEI is prepared to be the basis of a digital edition optimized for viewing text and paratext in association on a computer screen. This encoding responds to the print edition's layout of footnotes positioned beneath the main text, and is intended to assist experimental screen layouts that preserve this association of text and paratext.</p>

         <change when="2017-05-07" resp="#ebb">Revised this header to include a proper revisionDesc changelog. Edited file to represent Center for the Digital Text as sponsoring organization. Added a front element to move prefatory material inside in the single-file edition to improve TEI conformance. Also prepared the original single-file edition to be transformed into a collection of smaller files for ease of processing. Added @xml:ids to number the volume divs.</change>
         <change when="2016" resp="#ebb">Added attributes to distinguish between analogous places and literal physical movement of characters, and wrote Schemtaron rules to control this.</change>

                                       fragance, which, being natives of the desert, are still
                                       perhaps without a name. Though these scented plants are the
                                       usual food of the camel, it is remarkable that his breath is
                                       insufferably nauseous. But when he is pushed by hunger, he
                                       devours thistles and prickles indiscriminately, without the
                                       least damage to his mouth, which seems proof to the sharpest

                                 <p> The hawk is used at <placeName>Aleppo</placeName> in taking the
                                    hare. "As soon as the hare is put up, one, or a brace of the
                                    nearest greyhounds are slipped, and <persName>the
                                       Falconer</persName> galloping after them, throws off his
                                    hawk. The hare cannot run long where the hawk behaves properly,
                                    but sometimes getting the start of the dogs, she gains the next
                                    hill and escapes. It now and then happens when the hawk is
                                    fierce and voracious in an unusual degree, that the hare is
                                    struck dead at the first stroke, but that is very uncommon; for
                                    the hawks preferred for hare hunting are taught to pounce and
                                    buffet the game, not to seize it, and they rise a little between
                                    each attack, to descend again with fresh force. In this manner
                                    the game is confused and retarded, till the greyhounds come in.

                                    Eagles. The Hawk in former times was taught to seize the Eagle
                                    under his pinion, and thus depriving him of the use of one wing,
                                    both birds fell to the ground together: but I am informed the
                                    present mode is to teach the Hawk to fix on the back between the
                                    wings, which has the same effect, only that the bird tumbling
                                    down more slowly, the Falconer has more time to come in to his
                                    Hawk's assistance; but in either case, if he be not very
                                    expeditious, the Falcon is inevitably destroyed. </p>

                                    <persName>Dr. Patrick Russell</persName> says, this sport was
                                    disused in his time, probably from its ending more frequently in
                                    the death of the Falcon than of the Eagle. But he had often seen
                                    the Shaheen take Herons and Storks. "The hawk when thrown off
                                    flies for some time in a horizontal line not six feet from the
                                    ground, then mounting perpendicularly with astonishing
                                    swiftness, he seizes his prey under the wing, and both together
                                    come tumbling to the ground. If the Falconer is not expeditious
                                    the game soon disengages itself. </p>

                                    <orgName>We</orgName> saw about twenty antelopes, which,
                                    however, were so very shy, that we could not get near enough to
                                    have a shot, nor do I think it possible to take them without
                                    hawks, the mode usually practised in those countries. The
                                    swiftest greyhounds would be of no use, for the antelopes are
                                    much swifter of foot than any animal I ever saw before.

                                    They take the whole skin of a stag, of the head, body, and legs,
                                    and stuff it with straw to the shape of the animal. After fixing
                                    it in the place where they usually train the bird, they place
                                    his food upon the head of the stuffed stag, and chiefly in the
                                    two cavities of the eyes, that the Bird may strike there. Having
                                    accustomed him for several days to eat in this manner, they
                                    fasten the feet of the stag to a plank which runs upon wheels,
                                    which is drawn by cords from a distance; and from day to day
                                    they draw it faster, insensibly to accustom the Bird not to quit
                                    his prey; and at last they draw the stag by a horse at full
                                    speed. They do the same with the wild boar, the ass, the fox,
                                    the hare, and other beasts of chase.—They are even taught to
                                    stop a horseman at full speed, nor will they quit him till

                                    wings in water, and then covers them with sand and gravel, with
                                    which he flies against the deer's face, and blinds him for a
                                    time; the pain of this sets him running about like a distracted
                                    creature, and frequently he tumbles down a rock or some steep
                                    place, and breaks his neck; thus he becomes a prey to the eagle.

                                    very gentle and tame. A horseman carries it, and on perceiving
                                    the Gazelle lets it loose: and tho' the Gazelle is incredibly
                                    swift, it is so nimble that in three bounds it leaps upon the

                                    with its sharp talons, but if unluckily it misses its blow and
                                    the Gazelle escapes, it remains upon the spot ashamed and

                                       enough. There is in this province a creature, or insect of
                                       the bigness of a flea, so sharp at stinging, that it not only
                                       pierces the skins of men and beasts, but the boughs and
                                       bodies of the trees. Those of the province of
                                          <placeName>Xantung</placeName> are much valued; where the
                                       inhabitants gather their eggs from the trees, and carry them
                                       to sell in the province of <placeName>Huquam</placeName>. In
                                       the spring, there come from these eggs certain worms, which
                                       about the beginning of the summer they place at the foot of
                                       the tree, whence they creep up, spreading themselves
                                       wonderfully over all the branches. Having placed themselves
                                       there, they gnaw, pierce, and bore to the very pith, and
                                       their nourishment they convert into wax as white as snow,
                                       which they drive out to the mouth of the hole they have made,
                                       where it remains congealed in drops by the wind, and cold.
                                       Then the owners of the trees gather it, and make it into
                                       cakes as we do, which are sold about

                                    which by our people is called Gekko, from its constant cry,
                                    (like among us that of the Cuckoe) is properly an Indian
                                    Salamander. It is about a foot long, its skin of of a pale or
                                    sea green colour, with red spots. The head is not unlike that of
                                    a tortoise, with a streight mouth. The eyes are very large,
                                    starting out of the head, with long and small eye-apples. The
                                    tail is distinguished by several white rings; its teeth are so
                                    sharp as to make an impression even upon steel. Each of its four
                                    legs had five crooked claws aimed on the end with nails. Its
                                    gait is very slow, but wherever it fastens it is not easily

                                    be immediately burnt with a red hot iron, or cut off. The blood
                                    is of a palish colour, resembling poison itself. </p>

                                    exasperated to the highest pitch sends forth a yellow liquor out
                                    of its mouth, which they gather in small pots set underneath,
