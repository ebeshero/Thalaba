      <encodingDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>Encoded with careful attention to the semantic association of text and paratext structures. Southey's paratext notes are encoded as hierarchical descendants of the line-group or other portion of Southey's main text on the spot where they are signalled. This is not only conformant with TEI standard practice but also is designed to help investigate semantic interlinkage of text and paratext in this heavily annotated epic poem. Encoding of proper names, especially places, people, and collectives is designed to trace associations made between text and paratext. References to places in the main text are encoded to determine whether they are mentioned literally, as places visited by the characters in the poem, or imagined referentially by analogy.</p>
            <p>This edition does not, however, attempt to reproduce the title page or page layout of the 1801 edition. Instead, the TEI is prepared to be the basis of a digital edition optimized for viewing text and paratext in association on a computer screen. This encoding responds to the print edition's layout of footnotes positioned beneath the main text, and is intended to assist experimental screen layouts that preserve this association of text and paratext.</p>

         <change when="2017-05-07" resp="#ebb">Revised this header to include a proper revisionDesc changelog. Edited file to represent Center for the Digital Text as sponsoring organization. Added a front element to move prefatory material inside in the single-file edition to improve TEI conformance. Also prepared the original single-file edition to be transformed into a collection of smaller files for ease of processing. Added @xml:ids to number the volume divs.</change>
         <change when="2016" resp="#ebb">Added attributes to distinguish between analogous places and literal physical movement of characters, and wrote Schemtaron rules to control this.</change>

                                 therein consumed the carcase to ashes. There was no marks of <name type="zomb">Vampirism</name> found on his son, or on the bodies

                                 the country, those people generally die who are sucked by <name type="zomb">Vampires</name>. Upon this a story was called to

                                 that <rs type="science" subtype="chem">he had found a way to rid

                                    however did not hinder his becoming a <name type="zomb">Vampire</name>;</rs> insomuch that his body being taken up
                                 forty days after his death, all the marks of a notorious <name type="zomb">Vampire</name> were found thereon. His complexion
                                 was fresh, his hair, nails and beard were grown; he was full of
                                 fluid blood, which ran from all parts of his body upon his shroud.

                                 caused a sharp stake to be thrust, as the custom is, through the

                                 dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his

                                 died. What this girl had said discovered <rs type="person">the son

                                 began to examine very narrowly, how, in spite of all their

                                 in so terrible a manner. After a strict inquisition, they found

                                 The man whose story we are going to relate, was a <persName>Peasant
                                    of <placeName>Mycone</placeName>
                                 </persName>, naturally ill natured and quarrelsome, this is a
                                 circumstance to be taken notice of in such cases. He was murdered
                                 in the fields, nobody knew how, or by whom. Two days after his
                                 being buried in a <rs type="building" subtype="temple">Chapel</rs>
                                 in the town, it was noised about that he was seen to walk <time>in
                                    the night</time> with great haste, that he tumbled about
                                 people's goods, put out their lamps, griped them behind, and a
                                 thousand other monkey tricks. At first the story was received with
                                 laughter; but the thing was looked upon to be serious when
                                    <orgName>the better sort of people</orgName> began to complain
                                 of it; <rs type="religion" subtype="eastOrth">
                                    <orgName>the Papas</orgName> themselves gave credit to the fact,

                                    with the exhalations from the carcass increased the stink, and
                                    began to muddle <orgName>the poor people</orgName>'s

                                    the smoke of the incense.</rs> They were incessantly bawling out

                                 before it; this is the name they give to these pretended <name type="zomb">Redivivi</name>. The noise bellowed thro' the

                                 roof of the <rs type="building" subtype="temple">chapel</rs>.
                                 Several there present averr'd that the wretches blood was extremely
                                 red; the <persName>Butcher</persName> swore the body was still
                                 warm, whence they concluded that <name type="zomb"> the

                                 dead, or in plain terms for suffering himself to be re-animated by
                                    <name type="divin">Old Nick</name>; which is the notion they
                                 have of <name type="zomb">Vroucolacas</name>. They then roar'd out
                                 that name in a stupendous manner. Just at this time came in
                                    <orgName>a flock of people</orgName> loudly protesting they
                                 plainly perceived the Body was not grown stiff when it was carried
                                 from the fields to Church to be buried, and that consequently it
                                 was a true <name type="zomb">Vroucolacas</name>; which word was
                                 still the burden of the song. </p>
                              <p> I don't doubt they would have sworn it did not stink, had not we
                                 been there; so mazed were <orgName>the poor people</orgName> with
                                 this disaster, and so infatuated with their <name type="zomb">notion of the Dead being re-animated</name>. As for us, who
                                 were got as close to the corpse as we could, that
                                    <orgName>we</orgName> might be more exact in our observations,
                                 we were almost poisoned with the intolerable stink that issued from
                                 it. When they asked us what we thought of this body, we told them
                                 we believed it to be very thoroughly dead: but as we were willing
                                 to cure, or at least not to exasperate their prejudiced
                                 imaginations, we represented to them, that it was no wonder the
                                    <persName>butcher</persName> should feel a little warmth when he
                                 groped among Entrails that were then rotting, that it was no
                                 extraordinary thing for it to emit fumes, since dung turned up will
                                 do the same; that as for the pretended redness of the blood, it
                                 still appeared by the butcher's hands to be nothing but a very
                                 stinking nasty smear. </p>
                              <p> After all our reasons they were of opinion it would be <rs type="science" subtype="chem">their wisest course to burn the

                                 not make him a bit more tractable; he went on with his racket more
                                 furiously than ever; he was accused of beating folks in the night,
                                 breaking down doors, and even roofs of houses, clattering windows,
                                 tearing clothes, emptying bottles and vessels. 'Twas <name type="zomb">the most thirsty Devil</name>! I believe he did not
