      <encodingDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>Encoded with careful attention to the semantic association of text and paratext structures. Southey's paratext notes are encoded as hierarchical descendants of the line-group or other portion of Southey's main text on the spot where they are signalled. This is not only conformant with TEI standard practice but also is designed to help investigate semantic interlinkage of text and paratext in this heavily annotated epic poem. Encoding of proper names, especially places, people, and collectives is designed to trace associations made between text and paratext. References to places in the main text are encoded to determine whether they are mentioned literally, as places visited by the characters in the poem, or imagined referentially by analogy.</p>
            <p>This edition does not, however, attempt to reproduce the title page or page layout of the 1801 edition. Instead, the TEI is prepared to be the basis of a digital edition optimized for viewing text and paratext in association on a computer screen. This encoding responds to the print edition's layout of footnotes positioned beneath the main text, and is intended to assist experimental screen layouts that preserve this association of text and paratext.</p>

         <change when="2017-05-07" resp="#ebb">Revised this header to include a proper revisionDesc changelog. Edited file to represent Center for the Digital Text as sponsoring organization. Added a front element to move prefatory material inside in the single-file edition to improve TEI conformance. Also prepared the original single-file edition to be transformed into a collection of smaller files for ease of processing. Added @xml:ids to number the volume divs.</change>
         <change when="2016" resp="#ebb">Added attributes to distinguish between analogous places and literal physical movement of characters, and wrote Schemtaron rules to control this.</change>

                              <p> The Souls of the Blessed are supposed by some of the Mohammedans
                                 to animate green Birds in <rs type="metaplace" subtype="garden" ref="Paradise">the Groves of Paradise</rs>. Was this opinion
                                 invented to conciliate the Pagan Arabs, who believed, that of the
                                 Blood near the dead person's brain was formed a Bird named Hamah,
                                 which once in a hundred years visited <rs type="metaplace" subtype="under" ref="Tombs">the sepulchre</rs>? </p>
                              <p> To this there is an allusion in the Moallakat. "Then I knew with
                                 certainty, that, in so fierce a contest with them, many a heavy
                                 blow would make the Perched Birds of the Brain fly quickly from
                                 every Skull." <bibl>Poem of Antara.</bibl>

                                 dwellers. The following passages in the same work may perhaps
                                 allude to the same superstition, or perhaps are merely
                                 metaphorical, in the usual stile of its true Oriental bombast.

                                 Birds of unusual size. No one knew whence they came. They emblemed,

                                 secrecy, and with much religious superstition. The bowels are, by
                                 these people, considered as the immediate organs of sensation,
                                 where the first impressions are received, and by which all the
                                 operations of the mind are carried on: it is therefore natural to
                                 conclude, that they may esteem, and venerate the intestines, as
                                 bearing the greatest affinity to the immortal part. I have
                                 frequently held conversations on this subject, with a view to
                                 convince them, that all intellectual operations were carried on in
                                 the head; at which they would generally smile, and intimate, that
                                 they had frequently seen men recover whose skulls had been
                                 fractured, and whose heads had otherways been much injured; but

                                 persons on a certainty died. Other arguments they would also
                                 advance in favour of their belief; such as the effect of fear, and
                                 other passions, which caused great agitation and uneasiness, and
                                 would sometimes produce sickness at the stomach, which they
                                 attributed intirely to the action of the bowels.

                              <p> When Hosein the son of Ali was sick of a grievous disorder, he
                                 longed for a pomegranate, tho' that fruit was not then in season.
                                 Ali went out, and diligently enquiring found a single one in the
                                 possession of a Jew. As he returned with it, a sick man met him and
                                 begged half the pomegranate, saying it would restore his health.
                                 Ali gave him half, and when he had eaten it, the man requested he
                                 would give him the other half, the sooner to complete his recovery.
                                 Ali benignantly complied, returned to his son and told him what had
                                 happened, and Hosein approved what his father had done. </p>
                              <p> Immediately behold a miracle! as they were talking together the
                                 door was gently knocked at. He ordered the woman servant to go
                                 there, and she found a man, of all men the most beautiful, who had
                                 a plate in his hand covered with green silk, in which were ten
                                 pomegranates. The woman was astonished at the beauty of the man and
                                 of the pomegranates, and she took one of them and hid it, and
                                 carried the other nine to Aly, who kissed the present. When he had
                                 counted them he found that one was wanting, and said so to the
                                 servant, she confessed that she had taken it on account of its
                                 excellence, and Ali gave her her liberty. The Pomegranates were
                                 from <rs type="metaplace" subtype="divin">Paradise</rs>, Hosein was
                                 cured of his disease only by their odour, and rose up immediately,
                                 recovered, and in full strength. <bibl>Maracci.</bibl>
                              </p>
                              <p> I suspect, says Maracci, that this is a true miracle wrought by
                                 some Christian Saint, and falsely attributed to Ali. However this
                                 may be, it does not appear absurd that<name type="divin">God</name>should by some especial favour reward an act of
                                 remarkable charity even in an Infidel, as he has sometimes by a
                                 striking chastisement punished enormous crimes. But the assertion
                                 that the Pomegranates were sent from <rs type="metaplace" subtype="divin">Paradise</rs>, exposes the fable. </p>
                              <p> Maracci after detailing and ridiculing the Mohammedan miracles,
                                 contrasts with them in an appendix a few of the real and permanent
                                 miracles of Christianity which are proved by the testimony of
                                    <placeName ref="the_world">the whole world</placeName>. He
                                 selects five as examples. 1. The Chapel of Loretto, brought by
                                 angels from <placeName>Nazareth</placeName> to
                                    <placeName>Illyricum</placeName>, and from Illyricum to
                                    <placeName>Italy</placeName>; faithful messengers having been
                                 sent to both places, and finding in both its old foundations, in
                                 dimensions and materials, exactly corresponding. </p>
                              <p> 2. The cross of St. Thomas in <placeName>Urbe
                                    Malipuritana</placeName> (Masulipatan) in the <placeName ref="East_Indies">E. Indies</placeName>. A Bramin, as the Saint
                                 was extended upon his cross in prayer, slew him. On the anniversary
                                 of his martyrdom, during the celebration of Mass, the cross
                                 gradually becomes luminous, till it shines one white glory. At
                                 elevating the host it resumes its natural colour, and sweats blood
                                 profusely, in which the faithful dip their clothes, by which many
                                 miracles are wrought. </p>
                              <p> 3. <hi rend="italic">Certissimum quia evidentissimum</hi>—at <hi rend="italic">Barii</hi> (Bari on the Adriatic) in Apulia a
                                 liquor flows from the bones of St. Nicholas, they call it St.
                                 Nicholas's manna, which being preserved in bottles never corrupts
                                 or breeds worms—except the possessor be corrupt himself—and daily
                                 it works miracles. </p>
                              <p> 4. At Tolentinum (Tolentino in the Marche of Anconia) the arms of
                                 St. Nicholas swell with blood, and pour out copious streams—when
                                 any great calamity impends over Christendom. </p>
                              <p> 5. The blood of St. Jaunarius at Naples. </p>
                              <p> These, says Maracci, are <hi rend="italic">miracula
                                    perseverantia</hi>, permanent miracles—and it cannot be said as
