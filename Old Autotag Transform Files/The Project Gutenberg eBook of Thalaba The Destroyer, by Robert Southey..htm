<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a><i>PREFACE</i></h2>


<p>In the continuation of the Arabian Tales,
the Domdaniel is mentioned; a Seminary
for evil Magicians under the Roots of the
Sea. From this seed the present Romance
has grown. Let me not be supposed to
prefer the metre in which it is written, abstractedly
considered, to the regular blank
verse; the noblest measure, in my judgement,
of which our admirable language
is capable. For the following Poem I
have preferred it, because it suits the varied
subject; it is the <i>Arabesque</i> ornament of an
Arabian tale.</p>

<p>The dramatic sketches of Dr. Sayer, a
volume which no lover of poetry will recollect
without pleasure, induced me when a
young versifier, to practise in this metre.
I felt that while it gave the poet a wider
range of expression, it satisfied the ear of
the reader. It were easy to make a parade
of learning by enumerating the various
feet which it admits; it is only needful to
observe that no two lines are employed in
<i>sequence</i> which can be read into one. Two
six-syllable lines (it will perhaps be answered)
compose an Alexandrine: the
truth is that the Alexandrine, when harmonious,
is composed of two six-syllable
lines.</p>

<p>One advantage this metre assuredly possesses;
the dullest reader cannot distort
it into discord: he may read it with a
<i>prose mouth</i>, but its flow and fall will still
be perceptible. Verse is not enough favoured
by the English reader: perhaps
this is owing to the obtrusiveness, the regular
Jews-harp <i>twing-twang</i>, of what has
been foolishly called heroic measure. I
do not wish the <i>improvisator&egrave;</i> tune, but
something that denotes the sense of harmony,
something like the accent of feeling;
like the tone which every Poet necessarily
gives to Poetry.</p>

<span class="i4">The black bitumen rolled.<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Shrieks, and wild yells that scared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The brooding Eagle from her midnight nest.<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Rose loftier in the hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood Zohak, wretched man, condemned to keep<br /></span>
<span class="i4">His Cave of punishment.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Bruise them, and rend their flesh with bloody nails,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A settled sorrow sate upon their brows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sorrow alone, for trace of guilt and shame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more remained; and gradual as by prayer<br /></span>

<span class="i2">With earnest eyes the banqueters<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The loose suggestions of the scene impure.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oneiza&rsquo;s image swam before his sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">His own Arabian Maid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He rose, and from the banquet room he rushed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And tears ran down his burning cheek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nature for a moment woke the thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And murmured, that from all domestic joys<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Estranged, he wandered o&rsquo;er the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lonely being, far from all he loved.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Son of Hodeirah, not among thy crimes<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">From tents of revelry,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Strong in the evening and distinct its shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay on the watry mirror, and his eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw it united with its parent pile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One huge fantastic fabric. Drawing near,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Sounds of carousal came and song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And unveiled women bade the advancing youth<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Come merry-make with them.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unhearing or unheeding, Thalaba<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Past o&rsquo;er with hurried pace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And plunged amid the forest solitude.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Deserts of Araby!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">His soul returned to you.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He cast himself upon the earth<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And closed his eyes, and called<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The voluntary vision up.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">A cry as of distress<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Aroused him; loud it came, and near!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He started up, he strung his bow,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">He plucked the arrow forth.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Again a shriek ... a woman&rsquo;s shriek!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And lo! she rushes thro&rsquo; the trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her veil all rent, her garments torn!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He follows close, the ravisher....<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Even on the unechoing grass<br /></span>
<span class="i4">She hears his tread, so close!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&ldquo;Prophet save me! save me God!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&ldquo;Help! help!&rdquo; she cried to Thalaba,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Thalaba drew the bow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The unerring arrow did its work of death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He turned him to the woman, and beheld<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His own Oneiza, his Arabian Maid.<br /></span>

<span class="i4">From fear, amazement, joy,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Alas! he strays a wretched wanderer<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He cannot rest, his sleep is misery,<br /></span>

<span class="i8">So she took his hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gently drew him forward, and they went<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Towards the mountain chain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was broad moonlight, and obscure or lost<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The garden beauties lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the great boundary rose, distinctly marked.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">These were no little hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sloping uplands lifting to the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their vine-yards, with fresh verdure, and the shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of ancient woods, courting the loiterer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To win the easy ascent: stone mountains these<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Desolate rock on rock,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The burthens of the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose snowy summits met the morning beam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When night was in the vale, whose feet were fixed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the world&rsquo;s<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> foundations. Thalaba surveyed<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The heights precipitous,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Impending crags, rocks unascendible,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And summits that had tired the eagle&rsquo;s wing;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">&ldquo;There is no way!&rdquo; he cried.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Paler Oneiza grew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hung upon his arm a feebler weight.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">But soon again to hope<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Revives the Arabian maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Thalaba imparts the sudden thought.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&ldquo;I past a river,&rdquo; cried the youth<br /></span>
<span class="i4">&ldquo;A full and copious stream.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The flowing waters cannot be restrained<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&ldquo;And where they find or force their way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;There we perchance may follow, thitherward<br /></span>
<span class="i4">&ldquo;The current rolled along.&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So saying yet again in hope<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Quickening their eager steps<br /></span>
<span class="i4">They turned them thitherward.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Silent and calm the river rolled along,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And at the verge arrived<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that fair garden, o&rsquo;er a rocky bed<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Towards the mountain base,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still full and silent, held its even way,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">But the deep sound, the dash<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Louder and louder in the distance rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">As if it forced its stream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Struggling with crags along a narrow pass.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lo! where raving o&rsquo;er a hollow course<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The ever-flowing tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foams in a thousand whirlpools! there adown<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The perforated rock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plunge the whole waters, so precipitous,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">So fathomless a fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That their earth-shaking roar came deadened up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like subterranean thunders.<br /></span>
<span class="i10"> &nbsp; &ldquo;Allah save us!&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oneiza cried, &ldquo;there is no path for man<br /></span>
<span class="i4">&ldquo;From this accursed place!&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And as she spake her joints<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were loosened, and her knees sunk under her.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Cheer up, Oneiza!&rdquo; Thalaba replied,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&ldquo;Be of good heart. We cannot fly<br /></span>
<span class="i4">&ldquo;The dangers of the place,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">&ldquo;But we can conquer them!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">And the young Arab&rsquo;s soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arose within him; &ldquo;what is he,&rdquo; he cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Who has prepared this garden of delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">&ldquo;And wherefore are its snares?&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">The Arabian Maid replied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The Women when I entered, welcomed me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;To Paradise, by Aloadin&rsquo;s will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Chosen like themselves, a Houri of the Earth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;They told me, credulous of his blasphemies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;That Aloadin placed them to reward<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;His faithful servants with the joys of Heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;O Thalaba, and all are ready here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;To wreak his wicked will, and work all crimes!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">&ldquo;How then shall we escape?&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Woe to him!&rdquo; cried the Appointed, a stern smile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Darkening with stronger shades his countenance,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&ldquo;Woe to him! he hath laid his toils<br /></span>
<span class="i4">&ldquo;To take the Antelope,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">&ldquo;The Lion is come in!&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She shook her head, &ldquo;a Sorcerer he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;And guarded by so many! Thalaba,...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;And thou but one!&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i8">He raised his hand to Heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">&ldquo;Is there not God, Oneiza?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;I have a Talisman, that, whoso bears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Him, nor the Earthly, nor the Infernal Powers<br /></span>
<span class="i4">&ldquo;Of Evil can cast down.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">&ldquo;Remember Destiny<br /></span>
<span class="i4">&ldquo;Hath marked me from mankind!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Now rest in faith, and I will guard thy sleep!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">So on a violet bank<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The Arabian Maid lay down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her soft cheek pillowed upon moss and flowers.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">She lay in silent prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Till prayer had tranquillized her fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And sleep fell on her. By her side<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Silent sate Thalaba,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And gazed upon the Maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And as he gazed, drew in<br /></span>
<span class="i2">New courage and intenser faith,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And waited calmly for the eventful day.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Loud sung the Lark, the awakened Maid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beheld him twinkling in the morning light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wished for wings and liberty like his.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The flush of fear inflamed her cheek,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But Thalaba was calm of soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Collected for the work.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">He pondered in his mind<br /></span>
<span class="i4">How from Lobaba&rsquo;s breast<br /></span>
<span class="i4">His blunted arrow fell.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Aloadin too might wear<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Spell perchance of equal power<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To blunt the weapon&rsquo;s edge!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Beside the river-brink,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose a young poplar, whose unsteady leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Varying their verdure to the gale,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">With silver glitter caught<br /></span>
<span class="i4">His meditating eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then to Oneiza turned the youth<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And gave his father&rsquo;s bow,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And o&rsquo;er her shoulders slung<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The quiver arrow-stored.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&ldquo;Me other weapon suits;&rdquo; said he,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">&ldquo;Bear thou the Bow: dear Maid!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The days return upon me, when these shafts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;True to thy guidance, from the lofty palm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Brought down the cluster, and thy gladdened eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Exulting turned to seek the voice of praise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Oh! yet again Oneiza, we shall share<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Our desert joys!&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">&nbsp; &nbsp; So saying to the bank<br /></span>
<span class="i4">He moved, and stooping low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With double grasp, hand below hand, he clenched<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And from its watry soil<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Uptore the poplar trunk.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then off he shook the clotted earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And broke away the head<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And boughs and lesser roots,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And lifting it aloft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wielded with able sway the massy club.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Now for this child of Hell!&rdquo; quoth Thalaba,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And lo! beneath yon lonely pine, the sledge....<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Their wide eyes watching for the youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their ears erected turned towards his way.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They were lean as lean might be,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Their furrowed ribs rose prominent,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And they were black from head to foot,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Save a white line on every breast<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Curved like the crescent moon.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And he is seated in the sledge,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His arms are folded on his breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The bird is on his knees;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There is fear in the eyes of the Dogs,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There is fear in their pitiful moan,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The Youth with the start of their speed<br /></span>

<span class="i2">An icey path thro&rsquo; rocks of ice,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His eye is at the summit now,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And thus far all is dangerless,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And now upon the height<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The black Dogs pause and pant,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They turn their eyes to Thalaba<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Once more away! and now<br /></span>

<span class="i4">One motion now, one bend,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thy shattered flesh will harden in the frost.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Why howl the Dogs so mournfully?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then Thalaba drew off Abdaldar&rsquo;s ring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cast it in the sea, and cried aloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Thou art my shield, my trust, my hope, O God!<br /></span>

<span class="i4">&ldquo;Thou who alone canst save.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">&ldquo;The justice of the hand that chastened me,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">&ldquo;I go to work thy will, and from the world<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Sun was rising all magnificent,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And gazed upon the little boat<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Riding the billows near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, like a sea-bird breasting the broad waves,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It rose and fell upon the surge;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till from the glitterance of the sunny main<br /></span>
<span class="i4">He turned his aching eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then upon the beach he laid him down<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And watched the rising tide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He did not pray, he was not calm for prayer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His spirit troubled with tumultuous hope<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Toiled with futurity.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His brain, with busier workings, felt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The roar and raving of the restless sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The boundless waves that rose and rolled and rocked;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The everlasting sound<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Meantime with fuller reach and stronger swell<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Wave after wave advanced;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The living flower, that, rooted to the rock,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Late from the thinner element<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That plays and dallies o&rsquo;er the night-closed flower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And woos it to unfold anew to joy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For it came on him as the dews of eve<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Upon the summer mead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or liker the first sound of seraph song<br /></span>

<span class="i4">&ldquo;A lion-hearted man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Shame on me, Stranger! in the arms of love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;I held him from his calling, till the hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Was past, and then the Angel who should else<br /></span>

<span class="i0">&ldquo;Thee the Deliverer, surely thou art he!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&ldquo;It was my righteous punishment<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;In the same youth unchanged and changeless love,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As thus she spake, the entrance of the cave<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The dim reflection of the darkened day<br /></span>

I have placed a scripture phrase in the mouth of a
Mohammedan; but it is a saying of Job, and there can
be no impropriety in making a modern Arab speak
like an ancient one. Resignation is particularly inculcated
by Mohammed, and of all his precepts it is that
which his followers have best observed: it is even the
vice of the East. It had been easy to have made
Zeinab speak from the Koran, if the tame language of
the Koran could be remembered by the few who have
toiled through its dull tautology. I thought it better to
express a feeling of religion in that language with which
our religious ideas are connected.</p></div>

varnished bricks of various colours, <i>like most fine buildings
in Persia</i>, says Tavernier. One of its domes is
covered with white flower work upon a green ground,
the other has a black ground, spotted with white stars.
Gilding is also common upon Oriental buildings. At
Boghar in Bactria our old traveller Jenkinson<a href="#Footnote_a" class="fnanchor">[a]</a>
saw &ldquo;many houses, temples, and monuments of stone
sumptuously builded and gilt.&rdquo;

In Pegu &ldquo;they consume about their Varely or idol
houses great store of leafe-gold, for that they overlay all
the tops of the houses with gold, and some of them are
covered with gold from the top to the foote; in covering

every ten years they new overlay them with gold,
from the top to the foote, so that with this vanetie they

<p>
A waste of ornament and labour characterises all the
works of the Orientalists. I have seen illuminated
Persian manuscripts that must each have been the
toil of many years, every page painted, not with representations
of life and manners, but usually like the
curves and lines of a Turkey carpet, conveying no idea
whatever, as absurd to the eye as nonsense-verses to the
ear. The little of their literature that has reached us
is equally worthless. Our <i>barbarian</i> scholars have called
Ferdusi the Oriental Homer. We have a specimen of
his poem; the translation is said to be bad, and certainly
must be unfaithful, for it is in rhyme; but the vilest
copy of a picture at least represents the subject and the
composition. To make this Iliad of the East, as they
have sacrilegiously stiled it, a good poem, would be realizing
the dreams of Alchemy, and transmuting lead into
gold.
</p><p>
The Arabian Tales certainly abound with genius;
they have lost their metaphorical rubbish in passing
through the filter of a French translation.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> The Arabians call this palace one of the wonders of
the world. It was built for N&ocirc;man-al-A&ocirc;uar, one of
those Arabian Kings who reigned at Hirah. A single
stone fastened the whole structure; the colour of the
walls varied frequently in a day. N&ocirc;man richly rewarded
the architect Sennamar; but recollecting afterwards
that he might build palaces equal, or superior
in beauty for his rival kings, ordered that he should be
thrown from the highest tower of the edifice.
</p><p class="ralign"><i>D&rsquo;Herbelot.</i></p>
</div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> The tribe of Ad were descended from Ad, the son of
Aus or Uz, the son of Irem, the son of Shem, the son
of Noah, who after the confusion of tongues, settled in
Al Ahk&acirc;f, or the winding sands, in the province of
Hadramaut, where his posterity greatly multiplied.
Their first King was Shedad, the son of Ad, of whom
the eastern writers deliver many fabulous things, particularly
that he finished the magnificent city his
father had begun, wherein he built a fine palace,
adorned with delicious gardens, to embellish which he
spared neither cost nor labour, proposing thereby to
create in his subjects a superstitious veneration of himself
as a God. This garden or paradise was called the
garden of Irem, and is mentioned in the Koran, and
often alluded to by the Oriental writers. The city they
tell us, is still standing in the desarts of Aden, being
preserved by providence as a monument of divine
justice, though it be invisible, unless very rarely, when
God permits it to be seen: a favour one Colabah pretended
to have received in the reign of the Khalif Mo&acirc;wiyah,
who sending for him to know the truth of the
matter, Colabah related his whole adventure; that is he
was seeking a Camel he had lost, he found himself on a
sudden at the gates of this city, and entering it, saw not
one inhabitant, at which being terrified, he stayed no
longer than to take with him some fine stones which he
shewed the Khalif.
</p><p class="ralign"><i>Sale.</i></p>
<p>
The descendants of Ad in process of time falling from
the worship of the true God into idolatry, God sent the
prophet Houd (who is generally agreed to be Heber) to
preach the unity of his essence and reclaim them. Houd
preached for many years to this people without effect,
till God at last was weary of waiting for their repentance.
The first punishment which he inflicted was a famine of
three years continuance, during all which time the heavens
were closed upon them. This, with the evils which
it caused, destroyed a great part of this people, who were
then the richest and most powerful of all in Arabia.
</p><p>
The Adites seeing themselves reduced to this extremity,
and receiving no succour from their false Gods, resolved
to make a pilgrimage to a place in the province of
Hegiaz, where at present Mecca is situated. There was
then a hillock of red sand there, around which a great
concourse of different people might always be seen; and
all these nations, the faithful as well as the unfaithful,
believed that by visiting this spot with devotion,
they should obtain from God whatever they petitioned
for, respecting the wants and necessities of life.
</p><p>
The Adites having then resolved to undertake this religious
journey, chose seventy men, at whose head they
appointed Mortadh and Kail, the two most considerable
personages of the country, to perform this duty in the
name of the whole nation, and by this means procure
rain from Heaven, without which their country must be
ruined. The deputees departed, and were hospitably
received by Mo&acirc;wiyah, who at that time reigned in the
province of Hegiaz. They explained to him the occasion
of their journey, and demanded leave to proceed and
perform their devotions at the Red Hillock, that they
might procure rain.
</p><p>
Mortadh, who was the wisest of this company, and
who had been converted by the Prophet Houd, often
remonstrated with his associates that it was useless to
to take this journey for the purpose of praying at this
chosen spot, unless they had previously adopted the
truths which the Prophet preached, and seriously
repented of their unbelief. For how, said he, can you
hope that God will shed upon us the abundant showers
of his mercy, if we refuse to hear the voice of him whom
he hath sent to instruct us?
</p><p>
Kail who was one of the most obstinate in error,
and consequently of the Prophets worst enemies, hearing
the discourses of his colleague, requested King Mo&acirc;wiyah
to detain Mortadh prisoner, whilst he and the
remainder of his companions proceeded to make their
prayers upon the Hillock. Mo&acirc;wiyah consented, and
detaining Mortadh captive, permitted the others to pursue
their journey and accomplish their vow.
</p><p>
Kail, now the sole chief of the deputation, having arrived
at the place, prayed thus, Lord give to the people of Ad
such rains as it shall please thee. And he had scarcely
finished when there appeared three clouds in the sky,
one white, one red, the third black. At the same time
these words were heard to proceed from Heaven, chuse
which of the three thou wilt. Kail chose the black,
which he imagined the fullest, and most abundant in
water, of which they were in extreme want. After having
chosen, he immediately quitted the place and took
the road to his own country, congratulating himself on
the happy success of his pilgrimage.
</p><p>
As soon as Kail arrived in the valley of Magaith, a part of
the territory of the Adites, he informed his countrymen
of the favourable answer he had received, and of the
cloud which was soon to water all their lands. The
senseless people all came out of their houses to receive it,
but this cloud, which was big with the divine vengeance
produced only a wind, most cold and most violent,
which the Arabs call Sarsar; it continued to blow for
seven days and seven nights, and exterminated all the unbelievers
of the country, leaving only the Prophet Houd
alive, and those who had heard him and turned to the
faith.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> Concerning the Pyramids, &ldquo;I shall put down, says
Greaves, that which is confessed by the Arabian writers
to be the most probable relation, as is reported by Ibn Abd
Alhokm, whose words out of the Arabick are these. &ldquo;the
greatest part of chronologers agree, that he which built
the Pyramids, was, Saurid Ibn Salhouk, King of Egypt,
who lived three hundred years before the flood. The occasion
of this was, because he saw in his sleep, that the
whole earth was turned over with the inhabitants of it,
the men lying upon their faces, and the stars falling down
and striking one another, with a terrible noise; and being
troubled, he concealed it. After this he saw the fixed
stars falling to the earth, in the similitude of white fowl,
and they snatched up men, carrying them between two
great mountains; and these mountains closed upon them,
and the shining stars were made dark. Awaking with
great fear, he assembles the chief priests of all the provinces
of Egypt, an hundred and thirty priests, the chief of
them was called Aclimum. Relating the whole matter
to them, they took the altitude of the stars, and making
their prognostication, foretold of a deluge. The King
said, will it come to our country? they answered, yea,
and will destroy it. And there remained a certain number
of years for to come, and he commanded in the mean
space to build the Pyramids, and a vault to be made, into
which the river Nilus entering should run into the countries
of the west, and into the land Al-Said. And he
filled them with <i>telesmes</i>,<a href="#Footnote_b" class="fnanchor">[b]</a> and with strange things, and
with riches and treasures and the like. He engraved in
them all things that were told him by wise men, as also
all profound sciences, the names of <i>alakakirs</i>,<a href="#Footnote_c" class="fnanchor">[c]</a> the uses
and hurts of them; the science of astrology and of arithmetick,
and of geometry, and of physick. All this may be
interpreted by him that knows their characters and language.
After he had given order for this building, they
cut out vast columns and wonderful stones. They fetch
massy stones from the &AElig;thopians, and made with these
the foundation of the three Pyramids, fastening them together
with lead and iron. They built the gates of them
forty cubits under ground, and they made the height of
the Pyramids one hundred royal cubits, which are fifty
of ours in these times; he also made each side of them
an hundred royal cubits. The beginning of this building
was in a fortunate horoscope. After that he had finished
it, he covered it with coloured satten from the top to the
bottom; and he appointed a solemn festival, at which were
present all the inhabitants of his kingdom. Then he
built in the western Pyramid thirty treasures, filled with
store of riches, and utensils, and with signatures made
of precious stones, and with instruments of iron, and
vessels of earth, and with arms that rust not, and with
glass which might be bended and yet not broken, and
with several kind of alakakirs, single and double, and with
deadly poisons, and with other things besides. He made
also in the east Pyramid divers celestial spheres and stars,
and what they severally operate in their aspects, and
the perfumes which are to be used to them, and the
books which treat of these matters. He also put in the
coloured Pyramid the commentaries of the Priests, in
chests of black marble, and with every Priest a book, in
which were the wonders of his profession, and of his
actions, and of his nature, and what was done in his
time, and what is, and what shall be, from the beginning
of time to the end of it. He placed in every Pyramid a
treasurer. The treasurer of the westerly Pyramid was a
statue of marble stone, standing upright with a lance,
and upon his head a serpent wreathed. He that came
near it, and stood still, the serpent bit him of one side,
and wreathing round about his throat and killing him,
returned to his place. He made the treasurer of the
east Pyramid, an idol of black agate, his eyes open
and shining, sitting upon a throne with a lance; when
any looked upon him, he heard of one side of him a
voice, which took away his sense, so that he fell prostrate
upon his face, and ceased not till he died. He
made the treasurer of the coloured Pyramid a statue of
stone, called <i>Albut</i>, sitting: he which looked towards
it was drawn by the statue, till he stuck to it, and
could not be separated from it, till such time as he died.
The Coptites write in their books, that there is an inscription
engraven upon them, the exposition of which
in Arabick is this, <i>I</i> <span class="smcap">King Saurid</span> <i>built the Pyramids in
such and such a time, and finished them in six years: he
that comes after me, and says that he is equal to me, let him
destroy them in six hundred years; and yet it is known,
that it is easier to pluck down, than to build up: I also
covered them, when I had finished them, with satten; and
let him cover them with mats.</i> After that <span class="smcap">Almamon</span> the
Calif entered &AElig;gypt, and saw the Pyramids. He desired
to know what was within, and therefore would
have them opened. They told him it could not possibly
be done. He replied I will have it certainly done. And
that hole was opened for him, which stands open to
this day, with fire and vinegar. Two smiths prepared
and sharpened the iron and engines, which they forced
in, and there was a great expence in the opening of it.
The thickness of the wall was found to be twenty cubits;
and when they came to the end of the wall, behind the
place they had digged, there was an ewer of green
emerald; in it were a thousand dinars very
weighty, every dinar was an ounce of our ounces: they
wondered at it, but knew not the meaning of it. Then
<span class="smcap">Almamon</span> said, cast up the account, how much hath
been spent in making the entrance; they cast it up, and
lo it was the same sum which they found, it neither
exceeded nor was defective. Within they found a square
well, in the square of it there were doors, every door
opened into a house (or vault) in which there were dead
bodies wrapped up in linen. They found towards the
top of the Pyramid, a chamber, in which there was an
hollow stone: in it was a statue of stone like a man, and
within it a man, upon whom was a breast-plate of gold
set with jewels; upon his breast was a sword of invaluable
price, and at his head a carbuncle of the bigness
of an egg, shining like the light of the day; and upon
him were characters written with a pen, no man knows
what they signify. After <span class="smcap">Almamon</span> had opened it, men
entered into it for many years, and descended by the
slippery passage which is in it; and some of them came
out safe, and others died.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Whilst the King was at Bologna a stone wonderful
in its species and nature was brought to him from the
East Indies, by a man unknown, who appeared by his
manners to be a Barbarian. It sparkled as tho&rsquo; all burning
with an incredible splendour, flashing radiance, and
shooting on every side its beams, it filled the surrounding
air to a great distance with a light scarcely by any
eyes endurable. In this also it was wonderful, that
being most impatient of the earth, if it was confined, it
would force its way and immediately fly aloft; neither
could it be contained by any art of man in a narrow
place, but appeared only to love those of ample extent.
It was of the utmost purity stained by no soil nor spot.
Certain shape it had none, for its figure was inconstant
and momentarily changing, and tho&rsquo; at a distance it was
beautiful to the eye, it would not suffer itself to be
handled with impunity, but hurt those who obstinately
struggled with it, as many persons before many spectators
experienced. If by chance any part of it was
broken off, for it was not very hard, it become nothing
less.

from the <i>Tofet al Mujalis</i>.
</p><p>
A pleasant and elevated spot being fixed upon, Shuddaud
dispatched an hundred chiefs to collect skilful
artists and workmen from all countries. He also commanded
the monarchs of Syria and Ormus to send him
all their jewels and precious stones. Forty camel loads
of gold, silver, and jewels, were daily used in the building,
which contained a thousand spacious quadrangles
of many thousand rooms. In the areas were artificial
trees of gold and silver, whose leaves were emeralds,
and fruit clusters of pearls and jewels. The ground
was strewed with ambergris, musk, and saffron. Between
every two of the artificial trees was planted one
of delicious fruit. This romantic abode took up five
hundred years in the completion. When finished,
Shuddaud marched to view it; and, when arrived near,
divided two hundred thousand youthful slaves, whom he
had brought with him from Damascus, into four detachments,
which were stationed in cantonments prepared
for their reception on each side of the garden, towards
which he proceeded with his favourite courtiers. Suddenly
was heard in the air a voice like thunder, and
Shuddaud looking up, beheld a personage of majestic
figure and stern aspect, who said, &ldquo;I am the Angel
of Death, commissioned to seize thy impure soul.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Shuddaud exclaimed, &ldquo;give me leisure to enter the
garden,&rdquo; and was descending from his horse, when the
seizer of life snatched away his impure spirit, and he fell
dead upon the ground. At the same time lightnings flashed
and destroyed the whole army of the infidel; and
the rose garden of Irim became concealed from the sight
of man.</p></div>

show it to every man of talents and taste in the city; he
therefore invited them to a banquet, and after the repast
was finished asked them if they knew any building
more magnificent and more perfect, in the architecture,
in the ornaments and in the furniture. All the guests
contented themselves with expressing their admiration,
and lavishing praise, except one, who led a retired and
austere life, and was one of those persons whom the
Arabians call Zahed.
</p><p>
This man spoke very freely to the Prince and said to
him, I find a great defect in this building, it is, that
the foundation is not good, nor the walls sufficiently
strong, so that Azrael can enter on every side, and the
Sarsar can easily pass thro&rsquo;. And when they showed
him the walls of the Palace ornamented with azure and
gold, of which the marvellous workmanship surpassed
in costliness the richness of the materials, he replied,
there is still a great inconvenience here! it is that we
can never estimate these works well, till we are laid
backwards. Signifying by these words that we never
understand these things rightly, till we are upon our
death-bed, when we discover their vanity.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_33_33" id="Footnote_33_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_33"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> The Arabians divide their day into twenty four hours,
and reckon them from one setting sun to another. As
very few among them know what a watch is, and as
they conceive, but imperfectly the duration of an hour,
they usually determine time almost as when we say, it
happened about noon, about evening, &amp;c. The moment
when the Sun disappears is called <i>Maggrib</i>, about two
hours afterwards they call it <i>El ascha</i>; two hours later,
<i>El m&auml;rfa</i>; midnight <i>Nus el lejl</i>: the dawn of morning
<i>El fadsjer</i>: sun rise <i>Es subhh</i>. They eat about nine in
the morning, and that meal is called <i>El ghadda</i>; noon
<i>El duhhr</i>; three hours after noon <i>El asr</i>. Of all these
divisions of time only noon and midnight are well
ascertained; they both fall upon the twelfth hour. The
others are earlier or later as the days are short or long.
The five hours appointed for prayer are <i>Maggrib, Nus
el lejl, El fedsjer, Duhhr</i>, and <i>El asr</i>.

living creature that happens to be within the sphere of
its activity, and immediate putrefaction of the carcases of
the dead. The Arabians discern its approach by an unusual
redness in the air, and they say that they feel a
smell of sulphur as it passes. The only means by which
any person can preserve himself from suffering by these
noxious blasts, is by throwing himself down with his face
upon the earth, till this whirlwind of poisonous exhalations
has blown over, which always moves at a certain
height in the atmosphere. Instinct even teaches the brutes
to incline their heads to the ground on these occasions.
</p><p class="ralign"><i>Niebuhr.</i></p>
<p>
The Arabs of the desert call these winds <i>Semoum</i> or poison,
and the Turks <i>Shamyela</i>, or wind of Syria, from
which is formed the <i>Samiel</i>.
</p><p>
Their heat is sometimes so excessive that it is difficult to
form any idea of its violence without having experienced
it; but it may be compared to the heat of a large oven
at the moment of drawing out the bread. When these
winds begin to blow, the atmosphere assumes an alarming
aspect. The sky at other times so clear, in this
climate, becomes dark and heavy; the sun loses his
splendour and appears of a violet colour. The air is not
cloudy, but grey and thick, and is in fact filled with an
extremely subtile dust, which penetrates every where.
This wind, always light and rapid, is not at first remarkably
hot, but it increases in heat in proportion as it continues.
All animated bodies soon discover it, by the
change it produces in them. The lungs which a too
rarefied air no longer expands, are contracted and become
painful. Respiration is short and difficult, the
skin parched and dry, and the body consumed by an internal
heat. In vain is recourse had to large draughts of
water; nothing can restore perspiration. In vain is coolness
sought for; all bodies in which it is usual to find it,
deceives the hand that touches them. Marble, iron,
water, notwithstanding the sun no longer appears, are
hot. The streets are deserted, and the dead silence of night
reigns every where. The inhabitants of houses and villages
shut themselves up in their houses, and those of
the desert in their tents, or in pits they dig in the earth,
where they wait the termination of this destructive heat.
It usually lasts three days, but if it exceeds that time it
becomes insupportable. Woe to the traveller whom this
wind surprizes remote from shelter! he must suffer all its
dreadful consequences which sometimes are mortal.
The danger is most imminent when it blows in squalls,
for then the rapidity of the wind increases the heat to such
degree as to cause sudden death. This death is a real
suffocation; the lungs being empty, are convulsed, the
circulation disordered, and the whole mass of blood
driven by the heart towards the head and breast; whence
that h&aelig;morrhage at the nose and mouth which happens
after death. This wind is especially fatal to persons of a
plethoric habit, and those in whom fatigue has destroyed
the tone of the muscles and the vessels. The corpse remains
a long time warm, swells, turns blue and is easily
separated; all which are signs of that putrid fermentation
which takes place in animal bodies when the
humours become stagnant. These accidents are to be
avoided by stopping the nose and mouth with handkerchiefs;
an efficacious method likewise is that practised
by the camels, who bury their noses in the sand and keep
them there till the squall is over.
</p><p>
Another quality of this wind is its extreme aridity;
which is such, that water sprinkled on the floor evaporates
in a few minutes. By this extreme dryness it
withers and strips all the plants, and by exhaling too suddenly
the emanations from animal bodies, crisps the
skin, closes the pores, and causes that feverish heat
which is the invariable effect of suppressed perspiration.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_36_36" id="Footnote_36_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36_36"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> From the <i>Mirror of Stones</i> I extract a few specimens of
the absurd ideas once prevalent respecting precious stones.
</p><p>
The <i>Amethyst</i> drives away drunkenness; for being bound
on the navel, it restrains the vapour of the wine, and so
disolves the ebriety.
</p><p>
<i>Alectoria</i> is a stone of a christalline colour, a little darkish,
somewhat resembling limpid water; and sometimes it has
veins of the colour of flesh. Some call it <i>Gallinaceus</i>, from
the place of its generation, the intestines of capons, which
were castrated at three years old, and had lived seven, before
which time the stone ought not to be taken out, for the
older it is, so much the better. When the stone is become
perfect in the Capon, he do&rsquo;nt drink. However tis never
found bigger than a large bean. The virtue of this stone is
to render him who carries it invisible, being held in the
mouth it allays thirst, and therefore is proper for wrestlers;
makes a woman agreable to her husband; bestows honors
and preserves those already acquired; it frees such as are
bewitched; it renders a man eloquent, constant, agreable
and amiable; it helps to regain a lost Kingdom, and acquire
a foreign one.
</p><p>
<i>Borax</i>, <i>Nosa</i>, <i>Crapondinus</i>, are names of the same stone,
which is extracted from a toad. There are two species;
that which is the best is rarely found; the other is black or
dun with a cerluean glow, having in the middle the similitude
of an eye, and must be taken out while the dead toad
is yet panting, and these are better than those which are extracted
from it after a long continuance in the ground.
They have a wonderful efficacy in poisons. For whoever
has taken poison, let him swallow this; which being down,
rolls about the bowels, and drives out every poisonous
quality that is lodged in the intestines, and then passes thro&rsquo;
the fundament, and is preserved.
</p><p>
<i>Corvia</i> or <i>Corvina</i>, is a Stone of a reddish colour, and accounted
artificial. On the calends of April boil the eggs
taken out of a Crow&rsquo;s nest till they are hard: and being
cold let them be placed in the nest as they were before.
When the crow knows this, she flies a long way to find the
stone, and having found it returns to the nest, and the
eggs being touched with it, they become fresh and prolific,
the Stone must immediately be snatched out of the nest,
its virtue is to increase riches, to bestow honors, and to
foretell many future events.

fly from Persia his native country, took refuge at Damascus,
and implored the protection of the Caliph Soliman.
When he was presented to that Prince, the Caliph suddenly
changed colour and commanded him to retire,
suspecting that he had poison about him. Soliman had
discovered it by means of ten stones which he wore upon
his arm. They were fastened there like a bracelet, and
never failed to strike one against the other and make a
slight noise when any poison was near. Upon enquiry
it was found that Giafar carried poison in his
ring, for the purpose of self-destruction in case he had
been taken by his enemies.

yron: and therefore the men of that country for the most
part carry such stones with them, withersoever they goe.
Many also cause one of the armes of their children, while
they are young, to be launced, putting one of the said
stones into the wound, healing also, and closing up the
said wound with the powder of a certain fish (the name
whereof I do not know) which powder doth immediately

of these stones, the people aforesaid doe for the most

kind of stratageme which the enemies of this nation,
knowing the vertue of the sayd stones, doe practise
against them: namely, they provide themselves armour
of yron or steele against their arrowes, and weapons also
poisoned with the poyson of trees, and they carry in their
hands wooden stakes most sharp and hard-pointed, as if
they were yron: likewise they shoot arrowes without yron
heades, and so they confound and slay some of their unarmed
foes trusting too securely unto the vertue of their
stones.

It happened the dead corps of a man was cast ashore at
Chatham, and being taken up was buried decently in the
Church yard; now there was an image or rood in the
Church called our Lady of Chatham, this Lady, say the
Monks, went the next night and roused up the Clerk,
telling him that a sinful person was buried near the place
where she was worshipped, who offended her eyes with
his ghastly grinning, and unless he were removed, to the
great grief of good people she must remove from thence
and could work no more miracles. Therefore she desired
him to go with her to take him up, and throw him into
the river again: which being done, soon after the body
floated again, and was taken up and buried in the Church
yard; but from that time all miracles ceased, and the
place where he was buried did continually sink downwards.
This tale is still remembered by some aged people,

In supernatural affairs dogs seem to possess a sedative
virtue. When peace was made, about the year 1170,
between the Earls of Holland, and Flanders, &ldquo;it was
concluded that Count Floris should send unto Count
Philip, a thousand men, expert in making of ditches,
to stop the hole which had beene made neere unto Dam,
or the Sluce, whereby the countrey was drowned round
about at everie high sea; the which the Flemings
could by no meanes fil up, neither with wood, nor any
other matter, for that all sunke as in a gulfe without
any bottome; whereby, in succession of time, Bruges
and all that jurisdiction, had been in danger to have bin
lost by inundation, and to become all sea, if it were not
speedily repaired. Count Floris having taken possession
of the isle of Walchran, returned into Holland, from
whence hee sent the best workmen he could find in all
his countries, into Flanders, to make dikes and causeies,
and to stop the hole neere unto this Dam, or Sluce,
and to recover the drowned land. These diggers being
come to the place, they found at the entrie of this
bottomlesse hole a Sea-dog, the which for six dayes together,
did nothing but crie out and howle very fearefully.
They, not knowing what it might signifie,
having consulted of this accident, they resolved to cast
this dogge into the hole. There was a mad-headed
Hollander among the rest, who going into the bottome
of the dike, tooke the dogge by the taile, and cast him
into the middest of the gulfe; then speedily they cast
earth and torfe into it, so as they found a bottome,
and by little and little filled it up. And for that many
workemen came to the repairing of this dike, who for
that they would not be far from their worke, coucht in
Cabines, which seemed to be a pretie towne. Count
Philip gave unto all these Hollanders, Zeelanders and
others, that would inhabit there, as much land as
they could recover from Dam to Ardenbourg, for them
and their successors, for ever, with many other immunities
and freedoms. By reason whereof many planted
themselves there, and in succession of time, made a
good towne there, the which by reason of this dog,
which they cast into the hole, they named <i>Hondtsdam</i>,
that is to say, <i>a dog&rsquo;s sluce</i>; <i>Dam</i> in Flemish signifying
a sluce, and <i>Hondt</i> a dog: and therefore at this day, the
said towne (which is simply called <i>Dam</i>) carrieth a
dog in their armes and blason.

of the lower class of the Bedouins, is proportionate
to that of their chiefs. All the wealth of a family
consists of moveables, of which the following is a
pretty exact inventory. A few male and female camels,
some goats and poultry, a mare and her bridle and saddle,
a tent, a lance sixteen feet long, a crooked sabre, a
rusty musket, with a flint or matchlock; a pipe, a
portable mill, a pot for cooking, a leathern bucket, a
small coffee roaster, a mat, some clothes, a mantle of
black woollen, and a few glass or silver rings, which the
women wear upon their legs and arms; if none of these
are wanting, their furniture is complete. But what the
poor man stands most in need of, and what he takes
most pleasure in, is his mare; for this animal is his
principal support. With his mare the Bedouin makes
his excursions against hostile tribes, or seeks plunder in
the country, and on the highways. The mare is preferred
to the horse, because she does not neigh, is more
docile, and yields milk, which on occasion, satisfies the
thirst and even the hunger of her master.

The Shaik, says Volney, with whom I resided in the
country of Gaza, about the end of 1784, passed for one
of the most powerful of those districts; yet it did not
appear to me that his expenditure was greater than that
of an opulent farmer. His personal effects, consisting
in a few pelisses, carpets, arms, horses, and camels,
could not be estimated at more than fifty thousand livres
(a little above two thousand pounds); and it must be
observed that in this calculation four mares of the breed
of racers are valued at six thousand livres, (two hundred
and fifty pounds), and each camel at ten pounds sterling.
We must not therefore, when we speak of the Bedouins,
affix to the words Prince and Lord, the ideas they usually
convey; we should come nearer the truth by comparing
them to substantial farmers, in mountainous countries,
whose simplicity they resemble in their dress as well as
in their domestic life and manners. A Shaik, who has
the command of five hundred horse, does not disdain to
saddle and bridle his own, nor to give him his barley and
chopped straw. In his tent, his wife makes the coffee,
kneeds the dough, and superintends the dressing of the
victuals. His daughters and kinswomen wash the linen,
and go with pitchers on their heads, and veils over their
faces, to draw water from the fountain. These manners
agree precisely with the descriptions in Homer, and the
history of Abraham, in Genesis. But it must be owned
that it is difficult to form a just idea of them without
having ourselves been eye witnesses.

Arab women in baking their bread. They have a small
place built with clay, between two and three feet high,
having a hole at the bottom, for the convenience of
drawing out the ashes, something similar to that of a
lime kiln. The oven (which I think is the most proper
name for this place) is usually about fifteen inches wide at
the top, and gradually grows wider to the bottom. It is
heated with wood, and when sufficiently hot, and
perfectly clear from smoke, having nothing but clear embers
at bottom (which continue to reflect great heat), they
prepare the dough in a large bowl, and mould the cakes
to the desired size on a board or stone placed near the
oven. After they have kneaded the cake to a proper
consistence, they pat it a little, then toss it about with
great dexterity in one hand, till it is as thin as they
choose to make it. They then wet one side of it with
water, at the same time wetting the hand and arm, with
which they put it into the oven. The wet side of the
cake adheres fast to the side of the oven till it is
sufficiently baked when if not paid sufficient attention
to, it would fall down among the embers. If they were
not exceedingly quick at this work, the heat of the oven
would burn the skin from off their hands and arms; but
with such amazing dexterity do they perform it, that
one woman will continue keeping three or four cakes at
a time in the oven till she has done baking. This mode,
let me add, does not require half the fuel that is made
use of in Europe.

passages from the Koran, they never strain the voice
by attempting to raise it too high, and this natural
music pleased me very much.
</p><p>
The airs of the Orientals are all grave and simple. They
chuse their singers to sing so distinctly that every word
may be comprehended. When several instruments are
played at once and accompanied by the voice, you hear
them all render the same melody, unless some one mingles
a running base, either singing or playing, always in
the same key. If this music is not greatly to our taste,
ours is as little to the taste of the Orientals.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_54_54" id="Footnote_54_54"></a><a href="#FNanchor_54_54"><span class="label">[54]</span></a> The Mosques, which they pronounce Mesg jid, are
built exactly in the fashion of our Churches, where instead
of such Seats and Benches as we make use
of, they only strew the Floor with Mats, upon which
they perform the several sittings and prostrations that are
enjoyned in their religion. Near the middle, particularly
of the principal Mosque of each city, there is a large
pulpit erected, which is ballustraded round, with about
half a dozen steps leading up to it. Upon these (for I
am told none are permitted to enter the pulpit) the
Mufty or one of the Im-ams placeth himself every
Friday, the day of the congregation, as they call it, and
from thence either explaineth some part or other of the
Coran, or else exhorteth the people to piety and good
works. That end of these Mosques, which regards
Mecca, whither they direct themselves throughout the
whole course of their devotions, is called the Kiblah,
in which there is commonly a nich, representing as a
judicious writer conjectures, the presence, and at the
same time the invisibility of the Deity. There is usually
a square tower erected at the other end, with a flag-staff
upon the top of it. Hither the cryer ascends at the
appointed times, and displaying a small flag, advertised
the people with a loud voice, from each side of the
battlements, of the hour of prayer. These places of the
Mahometan worship, together with the Mufty, Im-ams
and other persons belonging to them, are maintained
out of certain revenues arising from the rents of lands
and houses, either left by will or set apart by the public
for that use.
</p><p class="ralign"><i>Shaw.</i>
</p><p>
All the Mosques are built nearly in the same style.
They are of an oblong square form, and covered in the
middle with a large dome, on the top of which is fixed
a gilt crescent. In front there is a handsome portico
covered with several small cupolas, and raised one
step above the pavement of the court. The Turks
sometimes in the hot season, perform their devotions
there; and between the columns, upon cross iron bars,
are suspended a number of lamps, for illuminations on
the Thursday nights and on all festivals. The entrance
into the Mosque is by one large door. All these edifices
are solidly built of freestone, and in several the domes
are covered with lead. The minarets stand on one side
adjoining to the body of the Mosque. They are sometimes
square, but more commonly round and taper,
the gallery for the maazeen, or cryers, projecting a little
from the column near the top, has some resemblance to
a rude capital; and from this the spire tapering more in
proportion than before, soon terminates in a point
crowned with a crescent.

shade they afford the inhabitants, and <i>Beet el Shar</i>,
Houses of hair, from the matter they are made of. They
are the same with what the Antients called Mapalia,
which being then, as they are to this day, secured from
the heat and inclemency of the weather, by a covering
only of such hair cloth, as our coal sacks are made of,
might very justly be described by Virgil to have thin
roofs. When we find any number of them together
(and I have seen from 3 to 300) then they are usually
placed in a circle, and constitute a Dou-war. The fashion
of each tent is the same, being of an oblong figure, not
unlike the bottom of a ship turned upside down, as Satlust
hath long ago described them. However they differ
in bigness, according to the number of people who live
in them: and are accordingly supported, some with one
pillar, others with two or three: whilst a curtain or carpet
placed, upon occasion, at each of these divisions,
separateth the whole into so many apartments. The
pillar which I have mentioned, is a straight pole, 8 or
10 feet high and 3 or 4 inches in thickness, serving, not
only to support the tent, but being full of hooks fixd
there for the purpose, the Arabs hang upon it their
cloaths, baskets, saddles, and accoutrements of war.
Holofernes, as we read in Judith, 13. 16. made the like
use of the pillar of his tent, by hanging his fauchin upon
it, it is there called the <i>pillar of the bed</i>, from the custom
perhaps, that hath always prevailed, of having the upper
end of the carpet, matrass, or whatever else they lie upon,
turned from the skirts of the tent that way. But the
&#922;&#969;&#957;&#969;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#959;&#957;,
Canopy as we render it (ver. 9) should I
presume, be rather called the gnat or muskeeta net,
which is a close curtain of gauze or fine linnen, used
all over the Levant, by people of better fashion, to keep
out the flies. The Arabs have nothing of this kind; who
in taking their rest, lie horizontally upon the ground,
without bed, matrass or pillow, wrapping themselves up
only in their <i>Hykes</i>, and lying, as they find room upon
a mat or carpet, in the middle or corner of the tent.
Those who are married, have each of them a corner of
the tent, cantoned off with a curtain.

The tents of the Moors are somewhat of a conic form,
are seldom more than 8 or 10 feet high in the centre,
and from 20 to 25 in length. Like those of the remotest
antiquity, their figure is that of a ship overset, the keel
of which is only seen. These tents are made of twine,
composed of goat&rsquo;s hair, camel&rsquo;s wool, and the leaves
of the wild palm, so that they keep out water; but,
being black, they produce a disagreable effect at a
distant view.

their heads. In some other countries of Yemen all the
Arabs, even the Sheiks themselves, let their hair grow
and wear neither bonnet nor <i>Sasch</i>, but a handkerchief
instead, in which they tie the hair behind. Some let it
fall upon their shoulders and bind a small cord round
their heads instead of a turban. The Bedouins upon
the frontiers of Hedsjas and of Yemen wear a bonnet of
palm leaves, neatly platted.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_58_58" id="Footnote_58_58"></a><a href="#FNanchor_58_58"><span class="label">[58]</span></a> The music of the Bedoweens rarely consists of more
than one strain, suitable to their homely instruments,
and to their simple invention. The Arabebbah as they
call the bladder and string, is in the highest vogue, and
doubtless of great antiquity, as is also the Gaspah,
which is only a common reed, open at each end, having
the side of it bored, with three or more holes, according
to the ability of the Person who is to touch it: tho&rsquo; the
compass of their tunes rarely or ever exceeds an octave.
Yet sometimes, even in this simplicity of harmony,
they observe something of method and ceremony, for in
their historical <i>Cantatas</i> especially, they have their preludes
and symphonies; each stanza being introduced
with a flourish from the Arabebbah, while the narration
itself is accompanied with the softest touches they are
able to make, upon the Gaspah. The Tarr, another of
their instruments, is made like a Sive, consisting (as
Isidore describeth the Tympanum) of a thin rim or hoop
of wood, with a skin of parchment stretched over the
top of it. This serves for the Bass in all their Concerts,
which they accordingly touch very artfully with their
fingers, and the knuckles or palms of their hands, as the
time and measure require, or as force and softness are to
be communicated to the several parts of the performance.
The Tarr is undoubtedly the Tympanum of
the Antients, which appears as well from the general
use of it all over Barbary, Egypt and the Levant, as from
the method of playing upon it, and the figure of the
instrument itself, being exactly of the same fashion,
with what we find in the hands of Cybele and the Bacchanals
among the Basso Relievos and Statues of the
Antiets.

The Arabs have the <i>Cussuba,</i> or cane, which is only a
piece of large cane, or reed, with stops, or holes, like a

How great soever may have been the reputation the
Libyans once had, of being famous musicians, and of
having invented the pipe or flute, called by Greek author
<i>Hippophorbos</i>, I fancy few of them would be now much
liked at our Opera. As for this <i>tibicen</i>, flute or pipe, it
is certainly lost, except it be the <i>gayta</i>, somewhat like
the hautbois, called <i>zurna</i>, in Turkish, a martial instrument.
Julius Pollux, in a chapter entitled <i>de tibiarum
specie</i>, says, <i>Hippophorbos quam quidem Libyes Scenetes
invenerunt</i>, and again, shewing the use and quality
thereof, <i>h&aelig;c ver&ograve; apud equorum pascua utuntur, ejusque
materia decorticata laurus est, cor enim ligni extractum
acutissimam dat sonum</i>. The sound of the <i>gayta</i> agrees
well with this description, tho&rsquo; not the make. Several
Poets mention the <i>tibicen Libycus</i> and <i>Arabicus</i>: and
Alhen&aelig;us quotes Duris, and says, <i>Libycas tibia Poet&aelig;

It seems the Arabs are still great rhymers, and their
verses are sometimes rewarded, but I should not venture
to say that there are great Poets among them.
Yet I was assured in Yemen that it is not uncommon
to find them among the wandering Arabs in the country
of Dsj&acirc;f. It is some few years since a Sheik of these
Arabs was in prison at Sana: seeing by chance a bird
upon a roof opposite to him, he recollected that the
devout Mohammedans believe they perform an action
agreable to God in giving liberty to a bird encaged. He
thought therefore he had as much right to liberty as a
bird, and made a poem upon the subject, which was
first learnt by his guards, and then became so popular
that at last it reached the Imam. He was so pleased
with it that he liberated the Sheik, whom he had arrested
for his robberies.

high tones, and one must have lungs like theirs to support
the effort for a quarter of an hour. Their airs, in
point of character and execution, resemble nothing we
have heard in Europe, except the Seguidillas of the
Spaniards. They have divisions more laboured even
than those of the Italians, and cadences and inflections
of tone impossible to be imitated by European throats.
Their performance is accompanied with sighs and gestures,
which paint the passions in a more lively manner
than we snould venture to allow. They may be said
to excell most in the melancholy strain. To behold an
Arab with his head inclined, his hand applied to his ear,
his eye brows knit, his eyes languishing; to hear his plaintive
tones, his lengthened notes, his sighs and sobs, it is
almost impossible to refrain from tears, which as their
expression is, are far from bitter: and indeed they must
certainly find a pleasure in shedding them, since among
all their songs, they constantly prefer that which excites
them most, as among all accomplishments singing is
that they most admire.

All their literature consists in reciting tales and histories,
in the manner of the Arabian Nights Entertainments.
They have a peculiar passion for such stories: and employ
in them almost all their leisure, of which they have
a great deal. In the evening they seat themselves on
the ground at the door of their tents, or under cover if
it be cold, and there, ranged in a circle, round a little
fire of dung, their pipes in their mouths, and their legs
crossed, they sit awhile in silent meditation, till, on a
sudden, one of them breaks forth with, <i>Once upon a
time</i>,&mdash;and continues to recite the adventures of some
young Shaik and female Bedouin: he relates in what
manner the youth first got a secret glimpse of his mistress,
and how he became desperately enamoured of
her: he minutely describes the lovely fair, extols her
black eyes, as large and soft as those of the gazelle; her
languid and empassioned looks; her arched eye brows,
resembling two bows of ebony; her waist, straight and
supple as a lance; he forgets not her steps, light as those
of the <i>young filley</i>, nor her eye-lashes blackened with
<i>kohl</i>, nor her lips painted blue, nor her nails, tinged with
the golden coloured <i>henna</i>, nor her breasts, resembling
two pomegranates, nor her words, sweet as honey. He
recounts the sufferings of the young lover, <i>so wasted with
desire and passion, that his body no longer yields any
shadow</i>. At length, after detailing his various attempts
to see his mistress, the obstacles on the part of the parents,
the invasions of the enemy, the captivity of the
two lovers, &amp;c. he terminates, to the satisfaction of the
audience, by restoring them, united and happy, to the
paternal tent, and by receiving the tribute paid to his
eloquence, in the <i>ma sha allah</i><a href="#Footnote_g" class="fnanchor">[g]</a> he has merited. The
Bedouins have likewise their love songs, which have
more sentiment and nature in them than those of the
Turks, and inhabitants of the towns; doubtless because
the former, whose manners are chaste, know what love
is; while the latter, abandoned to debauchery, are acquainted
only with enjoyment.

are not the most destructive; as they fly, they yield to
the current of the wind which hurries them into the sea,
or into sandy deserts where they perish with hunger or
fatigue. The young locusts, that cannot fly, are the
most ruinous; they are about fifteen lines in length;
and the thickness of a goose quill. They creep over the
country in such multitudes that they leave not a blade
of grass behind; and the noise of their feeding announces
their approach at some distance. The devastations of
locusts increase the price of provisions, and often occasion
famines; but the Moors find a kind of compensation in
making food of these insects; prodigious quantities are
brought to market salted and dried like red herrings.
They have an oily and rancid taste, which habit only
can render agreeable; they are eat here, however, with
pleasure.
</p><p class="ralign"><i>Chenier.</i>
</p><p>
In 1778 the empire of Morocco was ravaged by these insects.
In the summer of that year, such clouds of locusts
came from the south that they darkened the air, and devoured
a part of the harvest. Their offspring, which
they left on the ground, committed still much greater
mischief. Locusts appeared and bred anew in the following
year, so that in the spring the country was
wholly covered, and they crawled one over the other
in search of their subsistence.
</p><p>
It has been remarked, in speaking of the climate of Morocco,
that the young locusts are those which are the
most mischievous; and that it seems almost impossible
to rid the land of these insects and their ravages, when
the country once becomes thus afflicted. In order to
preserve the houses and gardens in the neighbourhood
of cities, they dig a ditch two feet in depth and as much
in width. This they pallisade with reeds close to each
other, and inclined inward toward the ditch; so that
the insects unable to climb up the slippery reed, fall
back into the ditch, where they devour one another.
</p><p>
This was the means by which the gardens and vineyards
of Rabat, and the city itself were delivered from this
scourge, in 1779. The intrenchment, which was, at
least, a league in extent, formed a semicircle from the
sea to river, which separates Rabat from Sallee. The
quantity of young locusts here assembled was so prodigious
that, on the third day, the ditch could not be approached
because of the stench. The whole country
was eaten up, the very bark of the fig, pomegranate,
and orange tree, bitter, hard, and corrosive as it was
could not escape the voracity of these insects.
</p><p>
The lands, ravaged throughout all the western provinces,
produced no harvest, and the Moors being obliged to
live on their stores, which the exportation of corn
(permitted till 1774) had drained, began to feel a dearth.
Their cattle, for which they make no provision, and
which in these climates, have no other subsistance than
that of daily grazing, died with hunger; nor could any
be preserved but those which were in the neighbourhood
of mountains, or in marshy grounds, where the regrowth
of pasturage is more rapid.
</p><p>
In 1780, the distress was still farther increased. The
dry winter had checked the products of the earth,
and given birth to a new generation of locusts, who devoured
whatever had escaped from the inclemency of
the season. The husbandman did not reap even what
he had sowed, and found himself destitute of food,
cattle, or seed corn. In this time of extreme wretchedness
the poor felt all the horrors of famine. They
were seen wandering over the country to devour roots,
and, perhaps, abridged their days by digging into the
entrails of the earth in search of the crude means by
which they might be preserved.
</p><p>
Vast numbers perished of indigestible food and want.
I have beheld country people in the roads, and in the
streets, who had died of hunger, and who were thrown
across asses to be taken and buried. Fathers sold
their children. The husband, with the consent of his
wife, would take her into another province, there to bestow
her in marriage as if she were his sister, and
afterwards come and reclaim her when his wants were
no longer so great. I have seen women and children
run after camels, and rake in their dung to seek for some
indigested grain of barley, which, if they found, they devoured
with avidity.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_67_67" id="Footnote_67_67"></a><a href="#FNanchor_67_67"><span class="label">[67]</span></a> The Abmelec or eater of Locusts, or grasshoppers,
is a bird which better deserves to be described, perhaps,
than most others of which travellers have given us an
account, because the facts relating to it are not only
strange, in themselves, but so well and distinctly attested,
that however surprising they may seem, we cannot
but afford them our belief. The food of this creature
is the locust, or the grasshopper: it is of the size
of an ordinary hen, its feathers black, its wings large,
and its flesh of a greyish colour; they fly generally in
great flocks, as the starlings are wont to do with us:
but the thing which renders these birds wonderful is,
that they are so fond of the water of a certain fountain
in Corasson, or Bactria, that where-ever that water is
carried, they follow; on which account it is carefully
preserved; for where ever the locusts fall, the Armenian
priests, who are provided with this water, bring a quanity
of it, and place in jars, or pour it into little channels
in the fields, the next day whole troops of these birds
arrive and quickly deliver the people from the locusts.
</p><p class="ralign"><i>Universal History.</i>
</p><p>
Sir John Chardin has given us, the following passage
from an antient traveller, in relation to this bird. In
Cyprus about the time that the corn was ripe for the
sickle, the earth produced such a quantity of cavalettes,
or locusts, that they obscured sometimes the splendour
of the sun. Wherever these came, they burnt and eat
up all; for this there was no remedy, since, as fast as
they were destroyed, the earth produced more: God,
however, raised them up a means for their deliverance,
which happened thus. In Persia, near the city of
Cuerch there is a fountain of water, which has a wonderful
property of destroying these insects; for a pitcher
full of this being carried in the open air, without passing
through house or vault, and being set on an high
place, certain birds which follow it, and fly and cry
after the men who carry it from the fountain, come to
the place where it is fixed. These birds are red and
black, and fly in great flocks together, like starlings;
the Turks and Persians call them Musulmans. These
birds no sooner came to Cyprus, but they destroyed the
locusts with which the Island was infested; but if the
water be spilt or lost these creatures immediately disappear;
which accident fell out when the Turks took
this Island; for one of them going up into the steeple of
Famagusta, and finding there a pitcher of this water, he,
fancying that it contained gold or silver, or some precious
thing, broke it, and spilt what was therein; since
which the Cypriots have been as much tormented as
ever by the locusts.
</p><p>
On the confines of the Medes and of Armenia, at certain
times a great quantity of Birds are seen who resemble
our blackbirds, and they have a property sufficiently
curious to make me mention it. When the corn in
these parts begins to grow, it is astonishing to see the
number of Locusts with which all the fields are covered.
The Armenians have no other method of delivering
themselves from these insects, than by going in procession
round the fields and sprinkling them with a particular
water which they take care to preserve in their houses.
For this water comes from a great distance, they fetch
it from a Well belonging to one of their Convents near
the frontiers, and they say that the bodies of many Christian
martyrs were formerly thrown into this well. These
processions and the sprinkling continue three or four
days, after which the Birds that I have mentioned come
in great flights, and whether it be that they eat the locusts,
or drive them away, in two or three days the
country is cleared of them.
</p><p class="ralign"><i>Tavernier.</i>
</p><p>
At Mosul and at Haleb, says Niebuhr, I heard much of
the Locust Bird, without seeing it. They there call it
<i>Samarmar</i>, or as others pronounce it, <i>Samarmog</i>. It is
said to be black, larger than a sparrow, and no ways
pleasant to the palate. I am assured that it every day destroys
an incredible number of Locusts; they pretend nevertheless
that the Locusts sometimes defend themselves,
and devour the Bird with its feathers, when they have
overpowered it by numbers. When the children in the
frontier towns of Arabia catch a live Locust, they place
it before them and cry <i>Samarmog</i>! And because it
stoops down terrified at the noise, or at the motion of
the child, or clings more closely to its place, the children
believe that it fears the name of its enemy, that it hides
itself, and attempts to throw stones. The <i>Samarmog</i> is
not a native of Mosul or Haleb, but they go to seek it in
Khorasan with much ceremony. When the Locusts
multiply very greatly, the government sends persons
worthy of trust to a spring near the village of <i>Samar&ucirc;n</i>,
situated in a plain between four mountains, by <i>Mesched</i>, or
<i>Musa er ridda</i>, in that province of Persia. The deputies
with the ceremonies prescribed fill a chest with this
water, and pitch the chest so that the water may neither
evaporate nor be spilt before their return. From the
spring to the Town whence they were sent, the chest
must always be between heaven and earth: they must
neither place it on the ground, nor under any roof, lest
it should lose all its virtue. Mosul being surrounded
with a wall, the water must not pass under the gate way,
but it is received over the wall, and the chest placed upon
the Mosque <i>Nebbi Gurgis</i>, a building which was formerly
a church, and which in preference to all the other buildings
has had from time immemorial the honour to
possess this chest upon its roof. When this precious
water has been brought from Khorasan with the requisite
precautions, the common Mohammedans, Christians
and Jews of Mosul believe that the <i>Samarmog</i> follows
the water, and remains in the country as long as there is
a single drop left in the chest of <i>Nebbi-Gurgis</i>. Seeing
one day a large stork&rsquo;s nest upon this vessel, I told a
Christian of some eminence in the town, how much I
admired the quick smell of the <i>Samarmog</i>, who perceived
the smell of the water thro&rsquo; such a quantity of ordure,
he did not answer me, but was very much scandalized
that the government should have permitted the stork to
make her nest upon so rare a treasure, and still more
angry, that for more than nine years, the government
had not sent to procure fresh water.

Dr. Russell describes this bird as about the size of a starling,
the body of a flesh colour, the rest of its plumage
black, the bill and legs black also.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_68_68" id="Footnote_68_68"></a><a href="#FNanchor_68_68"><span class="label">[68]</span></a> The Locusts are remarkable for the hieroglyphic that
they bear upon the forehead, their colour is green
throughout the whole body, excepting a little yellow
rim that surrounds their head, which is lost at their
eyes. This insect has two upper wings pretty solid:
they are green like the rest of the body, except that
there is in each a little white spot. The Locust keeps
them extended like great sails of a ship going before the
wind, it has besides two other wings underneath the
former, and which resemble a light transparent stuff
pretty much like a cobweb, and which it makes use of
in the manner of smack sails that are along a vessel; but
when the Locust reposes herself she does like a vessel
that lies at anchor, for she keeps the second sails furled
under the first.

The Mohammedans believe some mysterious meaning
is contained in the lines upon the Locust&rsquo;s forehead.

that a single insect should have found his way so far
inland.</p></div>

They pretend that God is the lock of this science, and
Mohammed the key, that consequently none but Mohammedans
can attain it; that it discovers what passes
in distant countries, that it familiarizes the possessors
with the Genii, who are at the command of the initiated
and who instruct them; that it places the winds and
the seasons at their disposal, that it heals the bile of
serpents, the lame, the maimed, and the blind. They
say that some of their greatest Saints, such as <i>Abdulkadir
Cheilani</i> of Bagdat, and <i>Ibn Alwan</i> who resided in the
south of Yemen, were so far advanced in this science
by their devotion, that they said their prayers every noon
in the Kaba of Mecca, and were not absent from their
own houses any other part of the day. A merchant of
Mecca, who had learnt it in all its forms from Mohammed
el Dsjan&acirc;dsjeni (at present so famous in that city)
pretended that he himself being in danger of perishing at
sea, had fastened a billet to the mast with the usual
ceremonies, and that immediately the tempest ceased.
He showed me at Bombay, but at a distance, a book
which contained all sorts of figures and mathematical
tables, with instructions how to arrange the billets and
the appropriate prayers for every circumstance. But he
would neither suffer me to touch the Book, nor copy
the title.
</p><p>
There are some Mohammedans who shut themselves up
in a dark place without eating and drinking for a long time,
and there with a loud voice repeat certain short prayers
till they faint. When they recover they pretend to have
seen not only a croud of Spirits, but God himself, and
even the Devil. But the true initiated in the Ism-Allah
do not seek these visions. The secret of discovering hidden
treasures, belong also, if I mistake not, to the
Ism Allah.

6 foot broad, serving the Arab for a compleat dress in
the day, and for his bed and covering in the night. It is
a loose but troublesome kind of garment, being frequently
disconcerted and falling upon the ground, so
that the person who wears it, is every moment obliged
to tuck it up, and fold it anew about his body. This
shews the great use there is for a girdle in attending any
active employment, and in consequence thereof, the
force of the scripture injunction alluding thereunto, of
<i>having our loyns girded</i>. The method of wearing these
garments, with the use they are at other times put to,
in serving for coverlets to their beds, should induce us to
take the finer sort of them at least, such as are wore by
the Ladies and persons of distinction, to be the <i>peplus</i> of
the antients. It is very probable likewise, that the loose
folding garment, (the <i>Toga</i> I take it to be) of the Romans,
was of this kind: for if the drapery of their
statues is to instruct us, this is actually no other than
what the Arabs appear in, when they are folded up in
their <i>Hykes</i>. Instead of the <i>fibula</i>, they join together,
with thread or a wooden bodkin, the two upper corners
of this garment, which being first placed over
one of their shoulders, they fold the rest of it afterwards
round their bodies.

The employment of the women is to prepare their
wool, spin, and weave in looms hung lengthways in
their tents. These looms are formed by a list of an ell
and a half long, to which the threads of the warp are
fixed at one end, and at the other on a roller of equal
length; the weight of which, being suspended, keeps
them stretched. The threads of the warp are so hung as
to be readily intersected. Instead of shuttles, the women
pass the thread of the woof thro&rsquo; the warp with their
fingers, and with an iron comb, having a handle,
press the woof to give a body to their cloth. Each
piece of about 5 ells long, and an ell and a half wide, is
called a <i>haick</i>; it receives neither dressing, milling nor
dying, but is immediately fit for use: it is the constant
dress of the Moors of the country, is without
seam, and incapable of varying according to the caprices
of fashion. When dirty it is washed: the Moor is
wrapped up in it day and night, and this <i>haick</i> is the
living model of the drapery of the ancients.

Anchieta was going in a canoe to the mouth of the river
Aldea, a delightful spot, surrounded with mango trees,
and usually abounding with birds called goarazes, that
breed there. These birds are about the size of a hen, their
colour a rich purple, inclining to red. They are white
when hatched, and soon become black, but as they
grow larger lose that colour and take this rich and
beautiful purple. Our navigators had reached the
place, but when they should have enjoyed the fine prospect
which delights all who pass it, the sun was excessively
hot, and this eye-pleasure was purchased dearly
when the whole body was in a profuse perspiration, and
the rowers were in a fever. Their distress called upon
Joseph, and the remedy was no new one to him. He
saw three or four of these birds perched upon a mango,
and calling to them in the Brazilian language which the
rowers understood, said, go you, call your companions,
and come to shade these hot servants of the Lord. The
birds stretched out their necks as if in obedience, and
away they went to seek for others, and in a short time
they came flying in the shape of an elegant cloud, and
they shadowed the canoe a good league out to sea till
the fresh sea breeze sprung up. Then they told them
they might go about their business, and they separated
with a clamor of rude but joyful sounds, which were
only understood by the Author of Nature who created
them. This was a greater miracle than that of the cloud
with which God defended his chosen people in the wilderness
from the heat of the sun, inasmuch as it was a
more elegant and fanciful parasol. <i>Acho que foy maior
portento este que o da nuvem, com que deos defendes no
deserto a seu Povo minoso do calor do sol, tanto quanto mais
tem de gracioso &amp; aprasivel este chapeo de sol, que
aquelle.</i>

circumstances of this animal&rsquo;s death, when his strength
fails him on the road, have something in them affecting
to humanity. Such are his patience and perseverance,
that he pursues his journey without flagging, as long as he
has power to support its weight; and such are his fortitude
and spirit, that he will never give out, until nature
sinks beneath the complicated ills which press upon
him. Then, and then only, will he resign his burden
and body to the ground. Nor stripes, nor caresses nor
food, nor rest, will make him rise again! His vigor
is exhausted, and life ebbs out apace! This the Arabs
are very sensible of, and kindly plunge a sword into the

the Arab feels remorse when he commits this deed: his
hardened heart is moved at the loss of a faithful servant.

where he can find little nourishment, Nature has been
sparing of her materials in the whole of his formation,
She has not bestowed upon him the plump fleshiness of
the ox, horse, or elephant; but limiting herself to
what is strictly necessary, she has given him a small
head without ears, at the end of a long neck without
flesh. She has taken from his legs and thighs every
muscle not immediately resquisite for motion; and in
short has bestowed on his withered body only the
vessels and tendons necessary to connect his frame together.
She has furnished him with a strong jaw, that
he may grind the hardest aliments; but lest he should
consume too much, she has contracted his stomach, and
obliged him to chew the cud. She has lined his foot
with a lump of flesh, which, sliding in the mud, and
being no way adapted for climbing, fits him only for a
dry, level, and sandy soil, like that of Arabia. She has
evidently destined him likewise to slavery, by refusing
him every sort of defence against his enemies. Destitute
of the horns of the bull, the hoofs of the horse, the
tooth of the elephant, and the swiftness of the stag, how
can the camel resist or avoid the attacks of the lion, the
tyger, or even the wolf? To preserve the species therefore,
Nature has concealed him in the depths of the
vast deserts, where the want of vegetables can attract no
game, and whence the want of game repels every voracious
animal. Tyranny must have expelled man from
the habitable parts of the earth, before the Camel could
have lost his liberty. Become domestic, he has rendered
habitable the most barren soil the world contains.
He alone supplies all his master&rsquo;s wants. The milk of
the Camel nourishes the family of the Arab, under the
various forms of curds, cheese, and butter; and they
often feed upon his flesh. Slippers and harness are
made of his skin, and tents and clothing of his hair.
Heavy burthens are transported by his means, and
when the earth denies forage to the horse, so valuable
to the Bedouin, the she-camel supplies that deficiency
by her milk, at no other cost, for so many advantages,
than a few stalks of brambles or wormwood, and
pounded date kernels. So great is the importance of
the Camel to the desert, that were it deprived of that
useful animal, it must infallibly lose every inhabitant.

relate similar sufferings.
</p><p>
&ldquo;I pushed on as fast as possible, in hopes of reaching
some watering-place in the course of the night. My
thirst was by this time become insufferable; my mouth
was parched and inflamed; a sudden dimness would
frequently come over my eyes, with other symptoms of
fainting; and my horse being very much fatigued, I
began seriously to apprehend that I should perish of
thirst. To relieve the burning pain in my mouth and
throat, I chewed the leaves of different shrubs, but
found them all bitter and of no service to me.
</p><p>
A little before sunset, having reached the top of a
gentle rising, I climbed a high tree, from the topmost
branches of which I cast a melancholy look over the
barren wilderness, but without discovering the most
distant trace of a human dwelling. The same dismal
uniformity of shrubs and sand every where presents
itself, and the horizon, was as level and uninterrupted as
that of the sea.
</p><p>
Descending from the tree, I found my horse devouring
the stubble and brushwood with great avidity; and as I
was now too faint to attempt walking, and my horse
too much fatigued to carry me, I thought it but an act
of humanity, and perhaps the last I should ever have
it in my power to perform, to take off his bridle and let
him shift for himself: in doing which I was suddenly
affected with sickness and giddiness, and falling upon
the sand, felt as if the hour of death was fast approaching.
Here then, thought I, after a short but ineffectual
struggle, terminate all my hopes of being useful in my
day and generation; here must the short span of my
life come to an end.&mdash;I cast (as I believed) a last look
on the surrounding scene, and whilst I reflected on the
awful change that was about to take place, this world
with its enjoyments seemed to vanish from my recollection.
Nature however, at length resumed its functions;
and on recovering my senses, I found myself
stretched upon the sand with the bridle still in my hand,
and the sun just sinking behind the trees. I now summoned
all my resolution, and determined to make
another effort to prolong my existence. And as the
evening was somewhat cool, I resolved to travel as far
as my limbs would carry me, in hopes of reaching (my
only resource) a watering place. With this view I put
the bridle on my horse, and driving him before me,
went slowly along for about an hour, when I perceived
some lightning from the north east, a most delightful
sight, for it promised rain. The darkness and lightning
increased very rapidly; and in less than an hour I heard
the wind roaring among the bushes. I had already
opened my mouth to receive the refreshing drops which
I expected, but I was instantly covered with a cloud of
sand, driven with such force by the wind as to give a
very disagreeable sensation to my face and arms, and I
was obliged to mount my horse and stop under a bush,
to prevent being suffocated. The sand continued to fly
in amazing quantities for near an hour, after which I
again set forward, and travelled with difficulty, until
ten o&rsquo;clock. About this time I was agreeably surprized
by some very vivid flashes of lightning, followed by a
few heavy drops of rain. In a little time the sand
ceased to fly, and I alighted, and spread out all my
clean clothes to collect the rain, which at length I saw
would certainly fall.&mdash;For more than an hour it rained
plentifully, and I quenched my thirst, by wringing and
sucking my clothes.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_84_84" id="Footnote_84_84"></a><a href="#FNanchor_84_84"><span class="label">[84]</span></a> All the time I was in Barbary I could never get
sight of above three or four Dromedaries. These the
Arabs call Mehera, the singular is Meheri. They are
of several sorts, and degrees of value, some worth many
common Camels, others scarce worth two or three.
To look on, they seem little different from the rest of
that Species, only I think the Excrescence on a Dromedary&rsquo;s
Back is somewhat less than that of a Camel.
What is reported of their sleeping, or rather seeming
scarce alive, for some Time after coming into this
World, is no Fable. The longer they lie so, the more
excellent they prove in their Kind, and consequently of
higher Price and Esteem. None lie in that Trance
more than ten Days and Nights. These that do, are
pretty rare, and are called Ashari from Aashara, which
signifies ten in Arabick. I saw one such, perfectly
white all over, belonging to Lella Oumane Princess of
that noble Arab Neja, named Hayl ben Ali, I spoke of,
and upon which she put a very great Value, never
sending it abroad but upon some extraordinary Occasion,
when the greatest Expedition was required; having
others, inferior in swiftness, for more ordinary Messages.
They say that one of these Aasharies will, in one Night,
and thro&rsquo; a level Country, traverse as much Ground as
any single Horse can perform in ten, which is no Exaggeration
of the Matter, since many have affirmed to
me, that it makes nothing of holding its rapid Pace,
which is a most violent Hard Trot, for four and twenty
Hours upon a Stretch without shewing the least Sign of
Weariness, or Inclination to Bait; and that having then
swallowed a Ball or two of Sort of a Paste, made up of
Barley-Meal, and may be a little Powder of Dates
among it, with a Bowl of Water, or Camel&rsquo;s Milk, if to
be had, and which the Courier seldom forgets to be
provided with, in Skins, as well for the Sustenance of
himself as of his Pegasus, the indefatigable Animal will
seem as fresh as at first setting out, and ready to continue
running at the same scarce credible Rate, for as
many Hours longer, and so on from one Extremity of
the African Desarts to the other; provided its Rider
could hold out without Sleep, and other Refreshment.
This has been averred to me, by, I believe more than
a thousand Arabs and Moors, all agreeing in every
Particular.
</p><p>
I happened to be, once in particular, at the Tent of
that Princess, with Ali ben Mahamoud, the Bey, or
Vice-Roy of the Algerine Eastern Province, when he
went thither to celebrate his Nuptials with Ambarca,
her only Daughter, if I mistake not. Among other
Entertainments she gave her Guests, the favourite
white Dromedary was brought forth, ready Saddled and
Bridled. I say Bridled, because the Thong, which
serves instead of a Bridle, was put thro&rsquo; the Hole purposely
made in the Gristle of the Creature&rsquo;s Nose. The
Arab appointed to mount, was straightly laced, from
the very Loins quite to his Throat, in a strong Leathern
Jacket; they never riding these Animals any otherwise
accoutred, so impetuously violent are the Concussions
the Rider undergoes, during that rapid Motion, that
were he to be loose. I much question whether a few
Hours such unintermitting Agitation would not endanger
the bursting of some of his Entrails: And this
the Arabs scruple not to acknowledge. We were to be
diverted with seeing this fine Ashari run against some
of the swiftest Barbs in the whole Neja, which is
famed for having good ones, of the true Libyan Breed,
shaped like Greyhounds, and which will sometimes run
down an Ostridge; which few of the very best can pretend
to do, especially upon a hard Ground, perfectly
level. We all started like Racers, and for the first
Spurt, most of the best mounted among us kept up
pretty well, but our Grass fed Horses soon flagged:
Several of the Libyan and Numidian Runners held
Pace till we, who still followed upon a good round
Hand Gallop, could no longer discern them, and then
gave out; as we were told after their Return. When
the Dromedary had been out of our Sight about half an
Hour, we again espied it flying towards us with an amazing
Volocity, and in a very few Moments was among
us, and seemingly nothing concerned; while the Horses
and Mares were all on a Foam, and scarce able to
breathe, as was, likewise, a fleet, tall Greyhound Bitch,
of the young Prince&rsquo;s, who had followed and kept Pace
the whole Time, and was no sooner got back to us,
but lay down panting as if ready to expire. I cannot
tell how many Miles we went; but we were near three
Hours in coming leisurely back to the Tents, yet made
no Stop in the Way. The young Prince Hamet ben al
Guydom ben Sakhari, and his younger Brother Messoud,
told their new Brother-in-Law, that they defied all the
Potentates of Africa to shew him such an Ashari; and
the Arab who rode it, challenged the Bey to lay his
Lady a Wager of 1000 Ducats, that he did not bring
him an Answer to a Letter from the Prince of Wargala,
in less than four Days, tho&rsquo; Leo Africanus, Marmol, and
several others assure us, that it is no less than forty
Spanish Leagues, of four Miles each, South of Tuggurt
to which Place, upon another Occasion, as I
shall observe, we made six tedious Days March from
the Neighbourhood of Biscara, North of which we
were then, at least thirty Hours riding, if I remember
rightly. However the Bey, who was a Native of Biscara,
and consequently well acquainted with the
Sahara, durst not take him up. By all Circumstances,
and the Description given us, besides what I know of
the Matter my self, it could not be much less than 400
Miles, and as many back again, the fellow offered to ride,
in so short a Time; nay many other Arabs boldly proffered
to venture all they were worth in the World, that
he would perform it with all the Ease imaginable.

accounts are probably much exaggerated.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_85_85" id="Footnote_85_85"></a><a href="#FNanchor_85_85"><span class="label">[85]</span></a> We were here at once surprised and terrified by a sight
surely the most magnificent in the world. In that vast
expanse of desert, from W. and to N. W. of us, we saw
a number of prodigious pillars of sand at different distances,
at times moving with great celerity, at others
stalking with a majestic slowness: at intervals we thought
they were coming in a very few moments to overwhelm us,
and small quantities of sand did actually more than once
reach us. Again they would retreat so as to be almost out
of sight, their tops reaching to the very clouds. There
the tops often separated from the bodies, and these once
disjoined, dispersed in the air and did not appear more.
Sometimes they were broken near the middle, as if
struck with a large cannon shot. About noon they
began to advance with considerable swiftness upon us,
the wind being very strong at north. Eleven of them
ranged alongside of us about the distance of three miles.
The greatest diameter of the largest appeared to me at
that distance as if it would measure ten feet. They
retired from us with a wind at S. E. leaving an impression
upon my mind to which I can give no name;
though surely one ingredient in it was fear, with a
considerable deal of wonder and astonishment. It
was in vain to think of flying, the swiftest horse, or
fastest sailing ship could be of no use to carry us out of
this danger, and the full persuasion of this rivetted me as
if to the spot where I stood.
</p><p>
On the 15th the same appearance of moving pillars of
sand presented themselves to us, only they seemed to be
more in number, and less in size. They came
several times in a direction close upon us; that is, I
believe, within less than two miles. They began immediately
after sun-rise, like a thick wood, and almost
darkened the sun. His rays shining through them for
near an hour, gave them an appearance of pillars of
fire. Our people now became desperate: the Greeks
shrieked out, and said it was the day of judgement.
Ismael pronounced it to be hell, and the Tucorories
that the world was on fire.

banks of the Tigris, where Seleucia formerly stood, was
so delighted with the beauty of the country, that he
resolved there to build his new Capital. Whilst he was
conversing with his attendants upon this project, one of
them separating from the rest met a hermit whose cell
was near, and entered into talk with him and communicated
the design of the Caliph. The Hermit replied,
he well knew by a tradition of the country that
a city would one day be built in that plain, but that its
founder would be a man called Moclas, a name very
different from both those of the Caliph, Giaffar and
Almanzor.
</p><p>
The Officer rejoined Almanzor and repeated his conversation
with the Hermit. As soon as the Caliph heard the
name of Moclas, he descended from his horse, prostrated
himself, and returned thanks to God for that he
was chosen to execute his orders. His courtiers waited
for an explanation of this conduct with eagerness, and
the Caliph told them thus. During the Caliphate of the
Ommiades, my brothers and myself being very young
and possessing very little, were obliged to live in the
country, where each in rotation was to provide sustenance
for the whole. On one of my days as I was without
money, and had no means of procuring food, I took a
bracelet belonging to my nurse and pawned it. This
woman made a great outcry, and after much search
discovered that I had been the thief. In her anger
she abused me plentifully, and among other terms of
reproach, she called me Moclas, the name of a famous
robber in those days; and during the rest of her
life she never called me by any other name. Therefore
I know that God has destined me to perform
this work.
</p><p class="ralign"><i>Marigny.</i>
</p><p>
Almanzor named his new city Dar-al-Salam the City of
Peace; but it obtained the name of Bagdat, from that of
this Hermit who dwelt upon its site.
</p><p>
Bagdat was founded in consequence of a singular superstition.
A sect called Ravendiens conceived that
they ought to render those honours to the Caliphs, which
the Moslem hold should only be paid to the Deity.
They therefore came in great numbers to Haschemia,
where the Caliph Almanzor usually resided, and made
around his palace the same processions and ceremonies
which the Moslem made around the Temple at Mecca.
The Caliph prohibited this, commanding them not to
profane a religious ceremony which ought to be reserved
solely to the Temple at Mecca. The Ravendiens did
not regard the prohibition, and continued to act as
before.
</p><p>
Almanzor seeing their obstinacy resolved to conquer
it, and began by arresting an hundred of these fanatics.
This astonished them, but they soon recovered their
courage, took arms, marched to the prison, forced the
doors, delivered their friends, and then returned to
make their processions round the palace in reverence of
the Caliph.
</p><p>
Enraged at this insolence the Caliph put himself at the
head of his guards, and advanced against the Ravendiens,
expecting that his appearance would immediately disperse
them. Instead of this they resisted, and repulsed
him so vigorously that he had nearly fallen a victim.
But timely succours arrived and after a great slaughter
these fanatics were expelled the town. This singular
rebellion arising from excess of loyalty so disgusted
Almanzor that he determined to forsake the town which
had witnessed it, and accordingly laid the foundation of
Bagdat.

They are very tame, and the inhabitants never molest

repeated by the others all over the town; and
this noise will sometimes continue for several minutes.
It is as loud as a watchman&rsquo;s rattle, and not much

gravity, shewing no concern at what was transacting
beneath them, but at intervals twisting about their long
necks, and cluttering with their beaks, turned behind
them upon their backs, as it were in concert.
This was continued the whole night. An
Owl, a bird also unmolested, was perched hard by,
and as frequently hooted. The crane is tall, like a
heron, but much larger; the body white, with black
pinions, the neck and legs very long, the head small,
and the bill thick. The Turks call it friend and brother,

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_97_97" id="Footnote_97_97"></a><a href="#FNanchor_97_97"><span class="label">[97]</span></a> Our early Travellers have given us strange and circumstantial
accounts of what they conceive to have
been the Temple of Belus.
</p><p>
The Tower of Nimrod or Babel is situate on that side of
Tygris that Arabia is, and in a very great plaine distant
from Babylon seven or eight miles; which tower is
ruinated on every side, and with the falling of it there is
made a great mountaine; so that it hath no forme at
all, yet there is a great part of it standing, which
is compassed and almost covered with the aforesayd
fallings: this Tower was builded and made of foure-square
brickes, which brickes were made of earth, and
dried in the Sunne in maner and forme following:
first they layed a lay of brickes, then a mat made of
canes, square as the brickes, and instead of lime, they
daubed it with earth: these mats of canes are at this
time so strong, that it is a thing woonderfull to beholde,
being of such great antiquity: I have gone round about
it, and have not found any place where there hath bene
any doore or entrance: it may be in my judgement in
circuit about a mile, and rather lesse than more.
</p><p>
This Tower in effect is contrary to all other things which
are seene afar off, for they seeme small and the more
nere a man commeth to them the bigger they be: but this
tower afar off seemeth a very great thing, and the nerer you
come to it the lesser. My judgement and reason of this
is, that because the Tower is set in a very great plaine,
and hath nothing more about to make any shew saving
the ruines of it which it hath made round about, and
for this respect descrying it afarre off, that piece of the
Tower which yet standeth with the mountaine that is
made of the substance that hath fallen from it, maketh
a greater shew than you shall finde comming neere
to it.
</p><p class="ralign"><i>C&aelig;sar Frederick.</i>
</p><p>
John Eldred mentions the same deception. &ldquo;Being
upon a plaine grounde it seemeth afarre off very great,
but the nerer you come to it, the lesser and lesser it
appeareth. Sundry times I have gone thither to see it,
and found the remnants yet standing about a quarter
of a mile in compasse, and almost as high as the stone
worke of St. Paul&rsquo;s steeple in London, but it sheweth
much bigger.&rdquo;
</p><p class="ralign"><i>Hakluyt.</i>
</p><p>
In the middle of a vast and level plain, about a quarter
of a league from Euphrates, which in that place runs
westward, appears a heap of ruined buildings, like a huge
mountain, the materials of which are so confounded
together that one knows not what to make of it. Its
figure is square, and rises in form of a tower or pyramid
with four fronts which answer to the four quarters of
the compass; but it seems longer from north to S.
than from E. to W. and is, as far as I could judge by
my pacing it, a large quarter of a league. Its situation
and form correspond with that pyramid which Strabo
calls the tower of Belus; and is in all likelihood the
tower of Nimrod in Babylon or Babel, as that place is
still called. In that author&rsquo;s time it had nothing remaining
of the stairs and other ornaments mentioned
by Herodotus, the greatest part of it having been ruined
by Xerxes; and Alexander who designed to have restored
it to its former lustre, was prevented by death.
There appear no marks of ruins without the compass of
that huge mass, to convince one that so great a city as
Babylon had ever stood there; all one discovers within
50 or 60 paces of it, being only the remains here and
there of some foundations of buildings; and the country
round about it so flat and level, that one can hardly
believe it should be chosen for the situation of so great
and noble a city as Babylon, or that there were ever any
remarkable buildings on it. But for my part I am
astonished there appears so much as there does, considering
it is at least 4000 years since that city was
built; and that Diodorus Siculus tells us, it was reduced
almost to nothing in his time. The height of this
mountain of ruins is not in every part equal, but exceeds
the highest palace in Naples: it is a mishapen
mass, wherein there is no appearance of regularity; in
some places it rises in points, is craggy and inaccessible;
in others it is smoother and is of easier ascent; there are
also tracks of torrents from the top to the bottom caused
by the rains, and both withinside and upon it, one sees
parts, some higher and some lower. It is not to be
discovered whether ever there were any steps to ascend
it, or any doors to enter into it; whence one may easily
judge that the stairs ran winding about on the outside;
and that being the less solid parts, they were soonest
demolished, so that not the least sign of any appears at
present.
</p><p>
Withinside one finds some grottos, but so ruined that
one can make nothing of them, whether they were built
at the same time with that work, or made since by the
peasants for shelter, which last seems to be the most
likely. The Mohammedans believe that these caverns
were appointed by God as places of punishment for
Harut and Marut, two angels, who they suppose were
sent from heaven to judge the armies of men, but did not
execute their commissions as they ought. It is evident
from these ruins, that the tower of Nimrod was built
with great and thick bricks, as I carefully observed,
causing holes to be dug in several places for the purpose;
but they do not appear to have been burnt, but dried in
the sun, which is extreme hot in those parts. In laying
these bricks neither lime nor sand was employed,
but only earth tempered and petrified, and in those parts
which made the floors, there had been mingled with
that earth which served instead of lime, bruised reeds,
or hard straw, such as large mats are made of to
strengthen the work. Afterwards one perceives at
certain distances in divers places, especially where the
strongest buttresses were to be, several other bricks of
the same size, but more solid and burnt in a kiln, and
set in good lime, or bitumen, nevertheless the greatest
number consists of those which are only dried in the
sun.
</p><p>
I make no doubt but this ruin was the ancient Babel, and
the tower of Nimrod; for besides the evidence of its
situation, it is acknowledged to be such by the people
of the country, being vulgarly called Babil by the
Arabs.

of Hit</i>, are much celebrated by the <i>Arabs</i> and <i>Persians</i>;
the latter call it <i>Cheshmeh kir</i>, the <i>fountain of pitch</i>.
This liquid bitumen they call <i>Nafta</i>; and the <i>Turks</i>, to
distinguish it from pitch, give it the name of <i>hara sakiz</i>,
or <i>black mastich</i>. A <i>Persian</i> geographer says, that <i>Nafta</i>
issues out of the springs of the earth as ambergrise issues
out of those of the sea. All the modern travellers,
except Rauwolf, who went to <i>Persia</i> and the <i>Indies</i> by
the way of the <i>Euphrates</i> before the discovery of the
<i>Cape of Good Hope</i>, mention this fountain of liquid
bitumen as a strange thing. Some of them take notice
of the river mentioned by <i>Herodotus</i>; and assure us,
that the people of the country have a tradition, that,
when the tower of <i>Babel</i> was building, they brought the
bitumen from hence; which is confirmed by the <i>Arab</i>
and <i>Persian</i> historians.
</p><p>
<i>Hit</i>, <i>Heit</i>, <i>Eit</i>, <i>Ait</i>, or <i>Idt</i>, as it is variously written by
travellers, is a great <i>Turkish</i> town situate upon the right
or west side of the <i>Euphrates</i>; and has a castle; to the
south-west of which and three miles from the town, in
a valley, are many springs of this black substance;
each of which makes a noise like a smith&rsquo;s forge, incessantly
puffing and blowing out the matter so loud, that it
may be heard a mile off: wherefore the <i>Moors</i> and <i>Arabs</i>
call it <i>Bab al Jehennam</i>; that is <i>hell gate</i>. It swallows
up all heavy things; and many camels from time to
time fall into the pits, and are irrecoverably lost. It
issues from a certain lake, sending forth a filthy smoke,
and continually boiling over with the pitch; which
spreads itself over a great field, that is always full of it.
It is free for every one to take: they use it to chaulk or
pitch their boats, laying it on two or three inches thick;
which keeps out the water: with it also they pitch their
houses, made of palm-tree branches. If it was not that
the inundations of the <i>Euphrates</i> carry away the pitch,
which covers all the sands from the place where it rises
to the river, there would have been mountains of it
long since. The very ground and stones thereabouts
afford bitumen; and the fields abundance of salt
petre.

rosary of beads called Tusbah, or implement of praise.
It consists, if I recollect aright, of ninty nine beads; in
dropping which through the fingers, they repeat the attributes
of God, as &ldquo;O Creator, O Merciful, O Forgiving,
O Omnipotent, O Omniscient, &amp;c. &amp;c.&rdquo; This act of
devotion is called Taleel, from the repetition of the
letter L, or Laum, which occurs in the word Allah,
(God), always joined to the epithet or attribute, as Ya
Allah Khalick, O God, the Creator; Ya Allah Kerreem,
O God, the Merciful, &amp;c. &amp;c. The devotees may be
seen muttering their beads as they walk the streets, and
in the interval of conversation in company. The
rosaries of persons of fortune and rank have the beads
of diamonds, pearls, rubies and emeralds. Those of
the humble are strung with berries, coral, or glass
beads.
</p><p class="ralign"><i>Note to the Bahar Danush.</i>
</p><p>
The ninty nine beads of the Mohammedan rosary are
divided into three equal lengths, by a little string, at
the end of which hang a long piece of coral and a large
bead of the same. The more devout, or hypocritical
Turks, like the Catholics have usually their bead string
in their hands.

lineally descended from Shed&acirc;d who perished with the
tribe of Ad. Zohak murdered his predecessor, and
invented the punishments of the cross, and of fleaing
alive. The Devil who had long served him, requested
at last as a recompence, permission to kiss his shoulders,
immediately two serpents grew there, who fed upon
his flesh and endeavoured to get at his brain. The
Devil now suggested a remedy, which was to quiet them
by giving them every day the brains of two men, killed
for that purpose: this tyranny lasted long, till a blacksmith
of Ispahan whose children had been nearly all
slain to feed the King&rsquo;s serpents, raised his leathern
apron as the standard of revolt, and deposed Zohak.
Zohak, say the Persians, is still living in the cave of his
punishment, a sulphureous vapour issues from the place,
and if a stone be flung in there comes out a voice and
cries, why dost thou fling stones at me? this cavern is
in the mountain of Demawend, which reaches from
that of Elwend, towards Teheran.

firmly believed in many parts of France, Germany and
Spain. The account of it, and the mode of preparation,
appears to have been given by a judge: in the latter
there is a striking resemblance to the charm in
Macbeth.
</p><p><i>Of the Hand of Glory, which is made use of by housebreakers,
to enter into houses at night, without fear of
opposition.</i></p>
<p>
I acknowledge that I never tried the secret of the Hand
of Glory, but I have thrice assisted at the definitive
judgment of certain criminals, who, under the torture,
confessed having used it. Being asked what it was, how
they procured it, and what were its uses and properties?
they answered, first, that the use of the Hand of Glory
was to stupify those to whom it was presented, and to
render them motionless, insomuch that they could not
stir, any more than if they were dead; secondly, that it
was the hand of a hanged man; and thirdly, that it
must be prepared in the manner following.
</p><p>
Take the hand, left or right, of a person hanged and exposed
on the highway; wrap it up in a piece of a shroud
or winding sheet, in which let it be well squeezed, to get
out any small quantity of blood that may have remained
in it; then put it into an earthen vessel with Zimat saltpetre,
salt, and long pepper, the whole well powdered;
leave it fifteen days in that vessel; afterwards take it
out, and expose it to the noontide sun in the dog days,
till it is thoroughly dry, and if the Sun is not sufficient,
put it into an oven heated with fern and vervain. Then
compose a kind of candle with the fat of a hanged man,
virgin wax, and sisame of Lapland. The Hand of
Glory is used as a candlestick to hold this candle, when
lighted. Its properties are, that wheresoever any one
goes with this dreadful instrument, the persons to whom
it is presented will be deprived of all power of motion.
On being asked if there was no remedy or antidote, to
counteract this charm, they said the Hand of Glory
would cease to take effect, and thieves could not make
use of it, if the threshold of the door of the house, and
other places by which they might enter, were anointed
with an unguent composed of the gall of a black cat,
the fat of a white hen, and the blood of a screech
owl, which mixture must necessarily be prepared during
the dog days.

care to adorn. Some of them possess, close to their
houses, gardens, trees, or cultivated grounds, and particularly
some spring or well of water. I was once
travelling in the south in the beginning of October,
when the season happened to be exceedingly hot, and
the wells and rivulets of the country were all dried up.
We had neither water, for ourselves, nor for our horses;
and after having taken much fruitless trouble to obtain
some, we went and paid homage to a Saint, who at
first pretended a variety of scruples before he would
suffer infidels to approach; but on promising to give
him ten or 12 shillings, he became exceedingly humane,
and supplied us with as much water as we wanted;
still however vaunting highly of his charity, and particularly
of his disinterestedness.

paint upon their ships and houses, as an antidote and
counter-charm to an evil eye: For five is with them an
unlucky number and five (fingers perhaps) in your eyes,
is their proverb of cursing and defiance. Those who
are grown up, carry always about with them some paragraph
or other of their Koran, which, like as the Jews
did their phylacteries, they place upon their breast, or
sow under their caps, to prevent fascination and witchcraft,
and to secure themselves from sickness and misfortunes.
The virtue of these charms and scrolls is
supposed likewise to be so far universal, that they suspend
them upon the necks of their cattle, horses and

intervals over more than two or three acres of the

Baths, are situated on a low ground, surrounded with
mountains. There are several fountains that furnish the
water, which is of an intense heat, and falls afterwards
into the Ze-nati. At a small distance from these hot
fountains, we have others, which upon comparison are
of as an intense a coldness; and a little below them,
somewhat nearer the banks of the Ze-nati, there are
the ruins of a few houses, built perhaps for the conveniency
of such persons, who came hither for the benefit
of the waters.
</p><p>
Besides the strong sulphureous steams of the Hammam<a href="#Footnote_j" class="fnanchor">[j]</a>
Meskouteen, we are to observe farther of them, that
their water is of so intense a heat, that the rocky ground
it runs over, to the distance sometimes of a hundred
foot, is dissolved, or rather calcined by it. When the
substance of these rocks is soft and uniform, then the
water by making every way equal impressions, leaveth
them in the shape of cones or hemispheres; which
being six foot high and a little more or less of the
same diameter, the Arabs maintain to be so many
tents of their predecessors turned into stone. But when
these rocks, besides their usual soft chalky substance,
contain likewise some layers of harder matter, not so
easy to be dissolved, then, in proportion to the resistance
the water is thereby to meet with, we are entertained
with a confusion of traces and channels, distinguished
by the Arabs into Sheep, Camels, Horses,
nay into Men, Women and Children, whom they
suppose to have undergone the like fate with their
habitations. I observed that the fountains which afforded
this water, had been frequently stopped up: or rather
ceasing to run at one place, broke out immediately in
another, which circumstance seems not only to account
for the number of cones, but for that variety likewise of
traces, that are continued from one or other of these
cones or fountains, quite down to the river Zenati.
</p><p>
This place, in riding over it, giveth back such a hollow
sound, that we were afraid every moment of sinking
thro&rsquo; it. It is probable therefore that the ground below
us was hollow: and may not the air then, which is
pent up within these caverns, afford, as we may suppose,
in escaping continually thro&rsquo; these fountains, that
mixture of shrill, murmuring and deep sounds, which,
according to the direction of the winds and the motion
of the external air, issue out along with the water? the
Arabs, to quote their strength of imagination once more,
affirm these sounds to be the music of the <i>Jenoune</i>,
Fairies, who are supposed, in a particular manner, to
make their abodes at this place, and to be the grand
agents in all these extraordinary appearances.
</p><p>
There are other natural curiosities likewise at this place.
For the chalky stone being dissolved into a fine impalpable
powder and carried down afterwards with the
stream, lodgeth itself upon the sides of the channel, nay
sometimes upon the lips of the fountains themselves;
or else embracing twigs, straws and other bodies in its
way, immediately hardeneth and shoots into a bright
fibrous substance, like the Asbestos, forming itself at
the same time, into a variety of glittering figures and
beautiful christalizations.

more than an hundred springs which sparkle like stars,
whence it is called Hotun Nor, the Sea of Stars. These
sources form two great lakes called Hala Nor, the black
sea or lake; afterwards there appear 3 or 4 little rivers,
which join&rsquo;d form the Whang-ho, which has 8 or 9
branches. These sources of the river are called also
Oton-tala. It is in Thibet.

The Whang ho, or as the Portugueze call it Hoam-ho,
i. e. the yellow River, rises not far from the source of the
Ganges in the Tartarian mountains west of China, and
having run thro&rsquo; it with a course of more than six hundred
leagues, discharges itself into the eastern sea. It hath
its name from a yellow mud which always stains its
water, and which after rains composes a third part of
its quantity. The watermen clear it for use by throwing
in alum. The Chinese say its waters cannot become
clear in a thousand years; whence it is a common
proverb among them for any thing which is never likely
to happen, when the yellow river shall run clear.

narrow winding defile, which, for the space of near half
a mile, lyeth on each side under an exceeding high
precipice, at every winding, the Rock or Stratum, that
originally went across it and thereby separated one
valley from another, is cut into the fashion of a door
case six or seven feet wide, giving thereby the Arabs an
occasion to call them <i>Beeban</i>, the Gates; whilst the
Turks in consideration of their strength and ruggedness,
know them by the additional appellation of <i>Dammer
Cappy</i>, the Gates of Iron. Few persons pass them
without horror, a handful of men being able to dispute
the passage with a whole Army. The rivulet of salt

of a kind of plane or poplar, a tree not known in Europe,

to the height of the Pine, and have very broad
leaves not much unlike those of the vine. Their fruit

it is not to be eaten. The wood thereof is very brown

certaine countrey called Melistorte, which is a very pleasant
and fertile place. And in this countrey there was a
certeine aged man called Senex de monte, who round
about two mountaines had built a wall to inclose the
sayd mountaines. Within this wall there were the
fairest and most chrystall fountaines in the whole
world: and about the sayd fountaines there were most
beautiful virgins in great number, and goodly horses
also, and in a word every thing that could be devised
for bodily solace and delight, and therefore the inhabitants
of the countrey call the same place by the name of
Paradise.
</p><p>
The sayd olde Senex, when he saw any proper and valiant
young man, he would admit him into his paradise.
Moreover by certaine conducts he makes wine and
milke to flow abundantly. This Senex, when he hath a
minde to revenge himselfe, or to slay any king or baron,
commandeth him that is governor of the sayd paradise,
to bring thereunto some of the acquaintance of the
sayd king or baron, permitting him awhile to take his
pleasure therein, and then to give him a certeine potion
being of force to cast him into such a slumber as should
make him quite voide of all sense, and so being in a profound
sleepe to convey him out of his paradise: who
being awaked, and seeing himselfe thrust out of the
paradise, would become so sorrowfull, that he could not
in the world devise what to do, or whither to turne him.
Then would he go unto the foresaide old man, beseeching
him that he might be admitted againe into his
paradise: who saith unto him, you cannot be admitted
thither, unlesse you will slay such or such a man for
my sake, and if you will give the attempt onely whether
you kill him or no, I wil place you againe in paradise,
that there you may remaine alwayes: then would the
party without faile put the same in execution, indevouring
to murther all those against whom the sayd olde
man had conceived any hatred. And therefore all the
kings of the east stood in awe of the sayd olde man, and
gave unto him great tribute.
</p><p>
And when the Tartars had subdued a great part of the
world, they came unto the sayd olde man, and tooke
from him the custody of his paradise: who being incensed
thereat, sent abroad divers desperate and resolute
persons out of his forenamed paradise, and caused many
of the Tartarian nobles to be slaine. The Tartars seeing
this, went and besieged the city wherein the sayd olde
man was, tooke him, and put him to a most cruell and
ignominious death.

The most particular account is given by that undaunted
liar Sir John Maundevile.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Beside the Yle of Pentexoire, that is the Lond of Prestre

Castelle and a strong, in a mountayne, so strong and so
noble that no man cowde devise a fairere ne a strengere.
And he had let muren all the mountayne aboute with a
strong walle and a fair. And with inne the walles he
had the fairest gardyn that ony man might behold; and
therein were trees beryinge all maner of frutes that ony

many faire welles, and beside the welles he had lete

many dyverse thinges, and many dyverse stories: and
of bestes and of bryddes that songen fulle delectabely,

also in that place, the faireste Damyseles that myghte

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_138_138" id="Footnote_138_138"></a><a href="#FNanchor_138_138"><span class="label">[138]</span></a> As the celestial Apostle, at his retreat from <i>Medina</i>,
did not perform always the five canonical prayers at the
precise time, his disciples, who often neglected to join
with him in the <i>Namaz</i>, assembled one day to fix upon
some method of announcing to the public those moments
of the day and night when their master discharged
this first of religious duties. Flags, bells, trumpets, and
fire were successively proposed as signals. None of
these, however, were admitted. The flags were rejected
as unsuited to the sanctity of the object; the bells, on
account of their being used by Christians; the trumpets,
as appropriated to the Hebrew worship; the fire, as
having too near an analogy to the religion of the pyrolators.
From this contrariety of opinions the disciples
separated without any determination. But one of them,
<i>Abdullah ibn Zeid Abderiy&eacute;</i>, saw the night following, in a
dream, a celestial being clothed in green: he immediately
requested his advice, with the most zealous earnestness,
respecting the object in dispute. I am come to inform
you, replied the heavenly visitor, how to discharge this
important duty of your religion. He then ascended to
the roof of the house, and declared the <i>Ezann</i> with a
loud voice, and in the same words which have been
ever since used to declare the canonical periods. When
he awoke, <i>Abdullah</i> ran to declare his vision to the prophet,
who loaded him with blessings, and authorized
that moment <i>Bilal Habeschy</i>, another of his disciples, to
discharge, on the top of his house, that august office, by
the title of <i>Muzzinn</i>.
</p><p>
These are the words of the Ezann: <i>Most high God!
most high God! most high God! I acknowledge that there
is no other except God; I acknowledge that there is no other
except God! I acknowledge that</i> Mohammed <i>is the Prophet
of God! come to prayer! come to prayer! come to the temple
of salvation! Great God! great God! there is no God
except God.</i>
</p><p>
This declaration must be the same for each of the five
canonical periods, except that of the morning, when the
<i>Muezzinn</i> ought to add, after the words, <i>come to the
temple of salvation</i>, the following: <i>prayer is to be preferred
to sleep, prayer is to be preferred to sleep</i>.
</p><p>
This addition was produced by the zeal and piety of
<i>Bilal Habeschy</i>: as he announced one day the <i>Ezann</i> of
the dawn in the prophet&rsquo;s antichamber, Aische in a
whisper informed him, that the celestial envoy was still
asleep; this first of the <i>Muezzinns</i> then added these
words, <i>prayer is to be preferred to sleep</i>: when he awoke
the prophet applauded him, and commanded <i>Bilal</i> to
insert them in all the morning <i>Ezanns</i>.
</p><p>
The words must be chanted, but with deliberation and
gravity, those particularly which constitute the profession
of the faith. The <i>Muezzinn</i> must pronounce them
distinctly; he must pay more attention to the articulation
of the words than to the melody of his voice; he
must make proper intervals and pauses, and not precipitate
his words, but let them be clearly understood by
the people. He must be interrupted by no other object
whatever. During the whole <i>Ezann</i> he must stand,
with a finger in each ear, and his face turned, as in
prayer, towards the <i>Keabe</i> of <i>Mecca</i>. As he utters these
words, come to prayer, come to the temple of salvation,
he must turn his face to the right and left, because he
is supposed to address all the nations of the world, the
whole expanded universe. At this time the auditors
must recite with a low voice the <i>Tehhlil</i>. There is no
strength, there is no power, but what is in God, in that
supreme Being, in that powerful Being.

undisturbed for many generations. For in these enclosures<a href="#Footnote_l" class="fnanchor">[l]</a>

with the ashes of the deceased. In the upper, the relations

<i>Mercure Historique et Politique</i>. Octob. 1736.
</p><p>
We have had in this country a new scene of Vampirism,
which is duly attested by two officers of the Tribunal of
<i>Belgrade</i>, who took cognizance of the affair on the spot,
and by an officer in his Imperial Majesty&rsquo;s troops at
<i>Gradisch</i> (<i>in Sclavonia</i>) who was an eye-witness of the
proceedings.
</p><p>
In the beginning of <i>September</i> there died at the village of
<i>Kisilova</i>, three leagues from <i>Gradisch</i>, an old man of
above threescore and two: three days after he was
buried he appeared in the night to his son, and desired
he would give him somewhat to eat, and then disappeared.
The next day the son told his neighbours these
particulars. That night the Father did not come, but
the next evening he made him another visit, and desired
something to eat. It is not known whether his son
gave him any thing or not, but the next morning the
young man was found dead in his bed. The Magistrate
or Bailiff of the place had notice of this, as also that the
same day five or six persons fell sick in the village, and
died one after the other. He sent an exact account of
this to the tribunal of <i>Belgrade</i>, and thereupon two commissioners
were dispatched to the village attended by an
executioner, with instructions to examine closely into
the affair. An officer in the Imperial service, from
whom we have this relation, went also from <i>Gradiseh</i>, in
order to examine personally an affair of which he had
heard so much. They opened in the first place the
graves of all who had been buried in six weeks. When
they came to that of the old man, they found his eyes
open, his colour fresh, his respiration quick and strong,
yet he appeared to be stiff and insensible. From these
signs they concluded him to be a notorious <i>Vampire</i>.
The executioner thereupon, by the command of the
commissioners, struck a stake thro&rsquo; his heart; and when
he had so done, they made a bonfire, and therein consumed
the carcase to ashes. There was no marks of
Vampirism found on his son, or on the bodies of the
other persons who died so suddenly.
</p><p>
Thanks be to God, we are as far as any people can be
from giving into credulity, we acknowledge that all the
lights of physick do not enable us to give any account
of this fact, nor do we pretend to enter into its causes.
However, we cannot avoid giving credit to a matter of
fact juridically attested by competent and unsuspected witnesses,
especially since it is far from being the only one
of the kind. We shall here annex an instance of the
same sort in 1732, already inserted in the Gleaner,
No. 18.
</p><p>
In a certain town of <i>Hungary</i>, which is called in Latin
<i>Oppida Heidonum</i>, on the other side <i>Tibiscus</i>, vulgarly
called the <i>Teysse</i>; that is to say, the river which washes
the celebrated territory of <i>Tokay</i> as also a part of
<i>Transilvania</i>. The people known by the name of <i>Heydukes</i>
believe that certain dead persons, whom they call Vampires,
suck the blood of the living, insomuch that these
people appear like skeletons, while the dead bodies of
the suckers are so full of blood, that it runs out at all
the passages of their bodies, and even at their very pores.
This odd opinion of theirs they support by a multitude
of facts attested in such a manner, that they leave no
room for doubt. We shall here mention some of the
most considerable.
</p><p>
It is now about five years ago, that a certain <i>Heyduke</i>, an
inhabitant of the village of <i>Medreiga</i>, whose name was
Arnold Paul, was bruised to death by a hay-cart, which
ran over him. Thirty days after his death, no less than
four persons died suddenly, in that manner, wherein,
according to the tradition of the country, those people
generally die who are sucked by Vampires. Upon this
a story was called to mind, that this <i>Arnold Paul</i> had
told in his life-time, viz: that at <i>Cossova</i> on the Frontiers
of the <i>Turkish Servia</i>, he had been tormented by a
Vampire; (now the established opinion is that a person
sucked by a Vampire, becomes a Vampire himself, and
sucks in his turn.) But that he had found a way
to rid himself of this evil, by eating some of the earth
out of the Vampire&rsquo;s grave, and rubbing himself with
his blood. This precaution however did not hinder his
becoming a Vampire; insomuch that his body being
taken up forty days after his death, all the marks of a
notorious Vampire were found thereon. His complexion
was fresh, his hair, nails and beard were grown;
he was full of fluid blood, which ran from all parts of
his body upon his shroud. The <i>Hadnagy</i> or <i>Bailiff</i> of
the place, who was a person well acquainted with Vampirism,
caused a sharp stake to be thrust, as the custom
is, through the heart of <i>Arnold Paul</i>, and also quite
through his body; whereupon he cried out dreadfully as
if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head,
burnt his body, and threw the ashes thereof into <i>Saave</i>.
They took the same measures with the bodies of those
persons who had died of Vampirism, for fear that they
should fall to sucking in their turns.
</p><p>
All these prudent steps did not hinder the same mischief
from breaking out again about five years afterwards,
when several people in the same village died in a very
odd manner. In the space of three months, seventeen
persons of all ages and sexes died of Vampirism, some
suddenly, and some after two or three days suffering.
Amongst others there was one <i>Stanoska</i>, the daughter of
a <i>Heyduke</i> whose name was <i>Jovitzo</i> who going to bed in
perfect health, waked in the middle of the night, and
making a terrible outcry, affirmed that the son of a
certain <i>Heyduke</i> whose name was <i>Millo</i>, and who had
been dead about three weeks, had attempted to strangle
her in her sleep. She continued from that time in a
languishing condition, and in the space of three days
died. What this girl had said discovered the son of
<i>Millo</i> to be a Vampire. They took up the body and
found him so in effect. The principal persons of the
place, particularly the Physician and Surgeons, began
to examine very narrowly, how, in spite of all their
precautions, Vampirism had again broke out in so terrible
a manner. After a strict inquisition, they found that
the deceased <i>Arnold Paul</i> had not only sucked the four
persons before mentioned, but likewise several beasts, of
whom the new Vampires had eaten, particularly the son
of <i>Millo</i>. Induced by these circumstances, they took a
resolution, of digging up the bodies of all persons who
had died within a certain time. They did so, and
amongst forty bodies, there were found seventeen evidently
Vampires. Through the hearts of these they
drove stakes, cut off their heads, burnt the bodies, and
threw the ashes into the river. All the informations we
have been speaking of were taken in a legal way, and
all the executions were so performed, as appears by
certificates drawn up in full form, attested by several
officers in the neighbouring garrisons, by the surgeons
of several Regiments, and the principal inhabitants of
the place. The verbal process was sent towards the
latter end of last <i>January</i> to the council of war at <i>Vienna</i>,
who thereupon established a special commission to
examine into these facts. Those just now mentioned
were attested by the <i>Hadnagi Barriarer</i>, the principal
<i>Heyduke</i> of the village, as also by <i>Battuer</i>, first Lieutenant
of Prince <i>Alexander</i> of <i>Wirtemberg</i>, <i>Flickstenger</i>,
surgeon major of the regiment of <i>Furstemberg</i>, three
other surgeons of the same regiment, and several other
persons.
</p><p>
A similar superstition prevails in Greece.
The man whose story we are going to relate, was a Peasant
of Mycone, naturally ill natured and quarrelsome,
this is a circumstance to be taken notice of in such
cases. He was murdered in the fields, nobody knew
how, or by whom. Two days after his being buried in
a Chapel in the town, it was noised about that he was
seen to walk in the night with great haste, that he tumbled
about people&rsquo;s goods, put out their lamps, griped
them behind, and a thousand other monkey tricks. At
first the story was received with laughter; but the thing
was looked upon to be serious when the better sort of
people began to complain of it; the Papas themselves
gave credit to the fact, and no doubt had their reasons
for so doing; masses must be said, to be sure: but for
all this, the Peasant drove his old trade and heeded nothing
they could do. After divers meetings of the chief
people of the city, of priests, and monks, it was gravely
concluded, that &rsquo;twas necessary in consequence of some
musty ceremonial to wait till nine days after the interment
should be expired.
</p><p>
On the tenth day they said one mass in the chapel
where the body was laid, in order to drive out the
Demon which they imagined was got into it. After
mass they took up the body, and got every thing ready
for pulling out its heart. The butcher of the town, an
old clumsy fellow, first opens the belly instead of the
breast, he groped a long while among the entrails, but
could not find what he looked for; at last somebody told
him he should cut up the Diaphragm. The heart was
then pulled out, to the admiration of all the spectators.
In the mean time the Corpse stunk so abominably that
they were obliged to burn frankincense; but the smoke
mixing with the exhalations from the carcass increased
the stink, and began to muddle the poor people&rsquo;s
pericranies. Their imagination, struck with the spectacle
before them, grew full of visions. It came into
their noddles, that a thick smoke came out of the body;
we durst not say &rsquo;twas the smoke of the incense. They
were incessantly bawling out Vroucolacas in the chapel
and place before it; this is the name they give to these
pretended Redivivi. The noise bellowed thro&rsquo; the streets,
and it seemed to be a name invented on purpose to rend
the roof of the chapel. Several there present averr&rsquo;d
that the wretches blood was extremely red; the Butcher
swore the body was still warm, whence they concluded
that the Deceas&rsquo;d was a very ill man for not being
thoroughly dead, or in plain terms for suffering himself to
be re-animated by Old Nick; which is the notion they
have of Vroucolacas. They then roar&rsquo;d out that
name in a stupendous manner. Just at this time came
in a flock of people loudly protesting they plainly perceived
the Body was not grown stiff when it was carried
from the fields to Church to be buried, and that
consequently it was a true Vroucolacas; which word
was still the burden of the song.
</p><p>
I don&rsquo;t doubt they would have sworn it did not stink,
had not we been there; so mazed were the poor people
with this disaster, and so infatuated with their notion of
the Dead being re-animated. As for us, who were got
as close to the corpse as we could, that we might be
more exact in our observations, we were almost poisoned
with the intolerable stink that issued from it.
When they asked us what we thought of this body, we
told them we believed it to be very thoroughly dead: but
as we were willing to cure, or at least not to exasperate
their prejudiced imaginations, we represented to them,
that it was no wonder the butcher should feel a little
warmth when he groped among Entrails that were
then rotting, that it was no extraordinary thing for it
to emit fumes, since dung turned up will do the same;
that as for the pretended redness of the blood, it still
appeared by the butcher&rsquo;s hands to be nothing but a
very stinking nasty smear.
</p><p>
After all our reasons they were of opinion it would be
their wisest course to burn the dead man&rsquo;s heart on the
sea-shore: but this execution did not make him a bit
more tractable; he went on with his racket more
furiously than ever; he was accused of beating folks in
the night, breaking down doors, and even roofs of
houses, clattering windows, tearing clothes, emptying
bottles and vessels. &rsquo;Twas the most thirsty Devil! I
believe he did not spare any body but the Consul in
whose house we lodged. Nothing could be more miserable
than the condition of this island; all the inhabitants
seemed frighted out of their senses: the wisest among
them were stricken like the rest; &rsquo;twas an epidemical
disease of the brain, as dangerous and infectious as the
madness of dogs. Whole families quitted their houses,
and brought their tent beds from the farthest parts of
the town into the public place, there to spend the night.
They were every instant complaining of some new
insult; nothing was to be heard but sighs and groans at
the approach of night: the better sort of people retired

When the prepossession was so general, we thought it
our best way to hold our tongues. Had we opposed it,
we had not only been accounted ridiculous blockheads,
but Atheists and Infidels, how was it possible to stand
against the madness of a whole people? Those that
believed we doubted the truth of the fact, came and
upbraided us with our incredulity, and strove to prove
that there were such things as Vroucolacasses, by citations
out of the Buckler of Faith, written by F. Richard
a Jesuit Missionary. He was a Latin, say they, and
consequently you ought to give him credit. We should
have got nothing by denying the justness of the consequence:
it was as good as a Comedy to us every morning
to hear the new follies committed by this night bird;
they charged him with being guilty of the most abominable
sins.

Some Citizens, that were most zealous for the good of
the public, fancied they had been deficient in the most
material part of the ceremony. They were of opinion
that they had been wrong in saying mass before they
had pulled out the wretches heart: had we taken this
precaution, quoth they, we had bit the Devil as sure as
a gun; he would have been hanged before he would
ever have come there again: whereas saying mass first,
the cunning Dog fled for it awhile and came back again
when the danger was over.
</p><p>
Notwithstanding these wise reflections, they remained in
as much perplexity as they were the first day: they
meet night and morning, they debate, they make professions
three days and three nights, they oblige the
Papas to fast; you might see them running from house
to house, holy-water-brush in hand sprinkling it all
about, and washing the doors with it; nay they poured
it into the mouth of the poor Vroucolacas.
</p><p>
We so often repeated it to the Magistrates of the town,
that in Xtendom we should keep the strictest watch
a nights upon such an occasion, to observe what was
done; that at last they caught a few vagabonds, who
undoubtedly had a hand in these disorders: but either
they were not the chief ringleaders, or else they were
released too soon. For two days afterwards, to make
themselves amends for the Lent they had kept in prison,
they fell foul again upon the wine tubs of those who
were such fools as to leave their houses empty in the
night: so that the people were forced to betake themselves
again to their prayers.

One day as they were hard at this work, after having
stuck I know not how many naked swords over the
grave of this corpse, which they took up three or four
times a day, for any man&rsquo;s whim; an Albaneze that
happened to be at Mycone, took upon him to say with
a voice of authority, that it was to the last degree ridiculous
to make use of the swords of Xtians in a case
like this. Can you not conceive, blind as ye are, says
he, that the handles of these swords being made like a
cross, hinders the Devil from coming out of the body?
Why do you not rather take the Turkish sabres? The
advice of this learned man had no effect: the Vroucolacas
was incorrigible, and all the inhabitants were in a
strange consternation; they knew not now what Saint
to call upon, when of a sudden with one voice, as if they
had given each other the hint, they fell to bawling out
all thro&rsquo; the city, that it was intolerable to wait any
longer; that the only way left was to burn the Vroucolacas
intire; that after so doing, let the Devil lurk in it if
he could; that &rsquo;twas better to have recourse to this
extremity than to have the island totally deserted, and
indeed whole families began to pack up, in order to
retire to Syre or Tinos. The magistrates therefore ordered
the Vroucolacas to be carryed to the point of the
island St. George, where they prepared a great pile with
pitch and tar, for fear the wood, as dry as it was, should
not burn fast enough of itself. What they had before
left of this miserable carcass was thrown into this fire
and consumed presently: &rsquo;twas on the first of January,
1701. We saw the flame as we returned from Delos;
it might justly be called a bonfire of joy, since after
this no more complaints were heard against the Vroucolacas;
they said that the Devil had now met with his
match, and some ballads were made to turn him into
ridicule.

&ldquo;As soon as the hare is put up, one, or a brace of the nearest
greyhounds are slipped, and the Falconer galloping after
them, throws off his hawk. The hare cannot run long
where the hawk behaves properly, but sometimes
getting the start of the dogs, she gains the next hill
and escapes. It now and then happens when the hawk
is fierce and voracious in an unusual degree, that the
hare is struck dead at the first stroke, but that is very
uncommon; for the hawks preferred for hare hunting
are taught to pounce and buffet the game, not to seize
it, and they rise a little between each attack, to descend
again with fresh force. In this manner the game is
confused and retarded, till the greyhounds come in.
</p><p class="ralign"><i>Russell.</i>
</p><p>
The Shaheen or Falcon Gentle, flies at a more dangerous
game. Were there not, says the elder Russell,
several gentlemen now in England to bear witness to
the truth of what I am going to relate, I should hardly
venture to assert that with this bird, which is about the
size of a pigeon, they sometimes take large Eagles.
The Hawk in former times was taught to seize the Eagle
under his pinion, and thus depriving him of the use of
one wing, both birds fell to the ground together: but I am
informed the present mode is to teach the Hawk to fix on
the back between the wings, which has the same effect,
only that the bird tumbling down more slowly, the
Falconer has more time to come in to his Hawk&rsquo;s
assistance; but in either case, if he be not very
expeditious, the Falcon is inevitably destroyed.
</p><p>
Dr. Patrick Russell says, this sport was disused in his
time, probably from its ending more frequently in the
death of the Falcon than of the Eagle. But he had
often seen the Shaheen take Herons and Storks. &ldquo;The
hawk when thrown off flies for some time in a horizontal
line not six feet from the ground, then mounting perpendicularly
with astonishing swiftness, he seizes his
prey under the wing, and both together come tumbling
to the ground. If the Falconer is not expeditious the
game soon disengages itself.
</p><p>
We saw about twenty antelopes, which, however, were
so very shy, that we could not get near enough to have
a shot, nor do I think it possible to take them without
hawks, the mode usually practised in those countries.
The swiftest greyhounds would be of no use, for the
antelopes are much swifter of foot than any animal I
ever saw before.

The Persians train their hawks thus. They take the
whole skin of a stag, of the head, body, and legs, and stuff
it with straw to the shape of the animal. After fixing
it in the place where they usually train the bird, they
place his food upon the head of the stuffed stag, and
chiefly in the two cavities of the eyes, that the Bird may
strike there. Having accustomed him for several days
to eat in this manner, they fasten the feet of the stag to
a plank which runs upon wheels, which is drawn by
cords from a distance; and from day to day they
draw it faster, insensibly to accustom the Bird not to
quit his prey; and at last they draw the stag by a horse
at full speed. They do the same with the wild boar,
the ass, the fox, the hare, and other beasts of chase.&mdash;They
are even taught to stop a horseman at full speed,
nor will they quit him till the Falconer recalls them
and shows them their food.

I do not recollect in what history or romance there is a
tale of two dogs trained in this manner to destroy a
Tyrant. But I believe it is an historical fiction.
The farmers in Norway believe that the Eagle will sometimes
attack a deer, in this enterprize he makes use of
this stratagem; he soaks his wings in water, and then
covers them with sand and gravel, with which he flies
against the deer&rsquo;s face, and blinds him for a time; the
pain of this sets him running about like a distracted
creature, and frequently he tumbles down a rock or some
steep place, and breaks his neck; thus he becomes a
prey to the eagle.

The Kings of Persia are very fond of the chase, and it is
principally in that, that they display their magnificence.
It happened one day that Cha-Sefi wished to entertain
all the Ambassadors who were at his court, and there
were then ministers there from Tartary, Muscovy and
India. He led them to the chase, and having taken in
their presence a great number of large animals, stags, does,
hinds and wild boars, he had them all dressed and eat
the same day, and while they were eating an Architect
was ordered to erect a tower in the middle of Ispahan,
only with the heads of these animals: the remains of
it are yet to be seen. When the Tower was raised
to its proper height, the Architect came exultingly to
the King who was then at the banquet with the
Ambassadors, and informed him that nothing was wanting to
finish the work well, but the head of some large beast
for the point. The Prince in his drunkenness, and with
a design of showing the Ambassadors how absolute he
was over his subjects, turned sternly to the Architect&mdash;<i>You
are right</i>, said he, <i>and I do not know where to find
a better head than your own</i>.  The unhappy man was
obliged to lose his head, and the royal order was
immediately executed.

had tho&rsquo; of bees: and there is such plenty as serves
the whole empire. Several provinces produce it, but
that of Huquam exceeds all the others, as well in quantity
as whiteness. It is gathered in the province of Xantung
upon little trees; but in that of Huquam upon
large ones, as big as those of the Indian Pagods, or
chesnut-trees in Europe. The way nature has found to
produce it, to us appears strange enough. There is in this
province a creature, or insect of the bigness of a flea, so
sharp at stinging, that it not only pierces the skins of
men and beasts, but the boughs and bodies of the trees.
Those of the province of Xantung are much valued;
where the inhabitants gather their eggs from the trees,
and carry them to sell in the province of Huquam. In
the spring, there come from these eggs certain worms,
which about the beginning of the summer they place at
the foot of the tree, whence they creep up, spreading
themselves wonderfully over all the branches. Having
placed themselves there, they gnaw, pierce, and bore to
the very pith, and their nourishment they convert into
wax as white as snow, which they drive out to the
mouth of the hole they have made, where it remains
congealed in drops by the wind, and cold. Then the
owners of the trees gather it, and make it into cakes as
we do, which are sold about China.

Another Mohammedan miracle of the same genus is no
ways improbable. When the head of Hosein was brought
to Couffah, the Governor&rsquo;s gates were closed, and Haula

wife and told her what had so speedily brought him
home. I bring with me, said he, the most valuable
present that could possibly be made to the Caliph, and
the woman asking earnestly what it could be, the head
of Hosein, here it is, I am sent with it to the Governor.
Immediately she sprung from the bed, not that she was
shocked or terrified at the sight, for the Arabian women
were accustomed to follow the army, and habituated to
the sight of blood and massacre. But Hosein by Fatima
his mother was grandson of the prophet, and this produced
an astonishing effect upon the mind of the woman.
By the Apostle of God, she exclaimed, I will
never again lie down with a man who has brought me
the head of his grandson. The Moslem who according
to the custom of his nation had many wives sent for
another who was not so conscientious. Yet the
presence of the head which was placed upon a table
prevented her from sleeping, <i>because</i> she said <i>she saw a

The balsam tree is nearly of the same size as a sprig of
myrtle, and its leaves are like those of the herb sweet-marjoram.
Vipers take up their residence about these
plants, and are in some places more numerous than in
others; for the juice of the balsam tree is their sweetest
food, and they are delighted with the shade produced by
its leaves. When the time therefore arrives for gathering
the juice of this Tree, the Arabians come into the
sacred grove, each of them holding two twigs, by shaking
these, they put to flight the Vipers; for they are unwilling
to kill them, because they consider them as the
sacred inhabitants of the balsam. And if it happens
that any one is wounded by a Viper, the wound resembles
that which is made by iron, but is not attended
with any dangerous consequences; for these animals
being fed with the juice of the balsam tree, which is the
most odoriferous of all trees, their poison becomes
changed from a deadly quality into one which produces

To this end they send to several places several coffins of
lead, with others of wood, which they call Taboat, and
bury all alike with the same magnificence. In this
manner they delude the curiosity of the people, who
cannot discern by the outside in which of the coffins the
real body should be. Not but it might be discovered by
such as would put themselves to the expence and trouble of
doing it. And thus it shall be related in the life of Habas
the great, that twelve of these coffins were conveyed to
twelve of the principal Mosques, not for the sake of their
riches, but of the person which they enclosed; and yet
nobody knew in which of the twelve the King&rsquo;s body was

consecrated to eneffable mysteries. There is a
prevailing opinion, that a thousand secret and invisible
prodigies are performed on this night; that all the inanimate
beings then pay their adoration to God; that all the
waters of the sea lose their saltness and become fresh
at these mysterious moments; that such in fine, is its
sanctity, that prayers said during this night are equal in
value to all those which can be said in a thousand successive
months. It has not however pleased God, says
the author of the celebrated theological work entitled
<i>Ferkann</i>, to reveal it to the faithful: no prophet, no
saint has been able to discover it: hence this night, so
august, so mysterious, so favoured by Heaven, has
hitherto remained undiscovered.

Republic to negotiate with the Emperor of the Turks.
Before he embarked on this voyage he took into his
service a boy of a red complection, the only son of a
widow, a poor woman, but a woman of honour and
virtuous. This Envoy on his arrival at Constantinople
immediately addressed himself to the first Physician of
his imperial highness, that thro&rsquo; his favour he might
have more access to negociate for his country. The
Mahometan had no sooner set eyes on the young
Ragusan, than he employed every artifice to induce his
master to leave him. The boy himself, at last, wishing
to remain at Constantinople, flattered by the fair prospects
that were held out to him, and touched with a
tender and heroic compassion for her who had given
him birth, prayed his protector to leave him with the
Barbarian, and carry to his mother the money which on
that account he would receive: So that the Ragusan
physician left his servant to the Byzantian, and received
from him a purse of a thousand sequins. After some
days the Italian went to take leave of the Mohammedan
Physician, and to thank him for his favours; and he
requested earnestly to see the red-headed boy before his
departure. The Turk was obliged to own he had made
poison of him, and led him into a chamber where the
naked body of the boy was still suspended by the feet.
The first master of the red-headed boy was greatly surprized
at the sight and still more so when he heard that
the boy had been beaten upon the belly for six hours,
by slaves who relieved one another, till he died:
and that a poison was made of the last foam that came
from his mouth, so penetrating, that if the stirrup of a
horse were touched with the point of a pin that had
been dipt in it, he who should mount would immediately
die.

</p><p>
In this volume the pleadings of the Mother against the
Ragusan physician, and his defence are given. The
Mother says, it is impossible that he, being a Physician
himself, should not have known for what the Infidel
Physician wanted to purchase a red-headed boy, as he
himself would have made the same use of him had he
not been afraid of the laws, the rest is in the usual stile
of Tristan&rsquo;s rhetoric.

As the Moslem employed a red-headed Christian in this
manufactory, it should seem that a Turk ought to be
used in Christendom. But as Turks are not easily
caught, a Jew might do.
</p><p>
In the Islands of Barlovento and in all the country of
Brazil, in Santa Marta and in the new kingdom, and in
other countries, where a cruel sort of Indians inhabited,
they used another sort of poison; for they would take
the leg of an Indian whom they had killed, and hang it
up in the air against the sun, and fill it with many barbs
of poisoned arrows, which were taken out of the flesh
of an Indian, which after some days they took out, and
without cleansing of them, they dried them in the air
where the sun did not come, and then they headed
their arrows with them; and that became the most
malevolent poison, and the most hard to be cured in the
world. After the Spaniards came into that country and
waged war upon the Indians, they then made it with
the flesh of Spaniards, whom they killed or took; but
more particularly they desired the flesh of some red-headed
Spaniard, whose hairs were of a deep saffron
colour; for they were of opinion that there was more
heat in that flesh, and consequently more virulency in
the poison which it produced: but perhaps they may
have heard it often said amongst the Spaniards themselves,
that red-headed men are fit to make a composition
of poison.

The Javanese had a method of procuring poison similar
to the Turkish receipt which I have employed.
</p><p>
The Cameleon, or Indian Salamander, otherwise called
Gekko.
</p><p>
This creature, which is not only found in Brasil, but
also in the Isle of Java, belonging to the East Indies, and
which by our people is called Gekko, from its constant
cry, (like among us that of the Cuckoe) is properly an
Indian Salamander. It is about a foot long, its skin of
of a pale or sea green colour, with red spots. The head
is not unlike that of a tortoise, with a streight mouth.
The eyes are very large, starting out of the head, with
long and small eye-apples. The tail is distinguished by
several white rings; its teeth are so sharp as to make
an impression even upon steel. Each of its four legs
had five crooked claws aimed on the end with nails.
Its gait is very slow, but wherever it fastens it is not
easily removed. It dwells commonly upon rotten trees,
or among the ruines of old houses and churches; it oftentimes
settles near the bedsteads, which makes sometimes
the moors pull down their huts.
</p><p>
Its constant cry is <i>gekko</i>, but before it begins it makes a
kind of hissing noise. The sting of this creature is so
venomous, that the wound proves mortal, unless it be
immediately burnt with a red hot iron, or cut off. The
blood is of a palish colour, resembling poison itself.
</p><p>
The Javanese use to dip their arrows in the blood of this
creature; and those who deal in poisons among them,
(an art much esteemed in the island of Java, by both
sexes) hang it up with a string tied to the tail on the
cieling, by which means it being exasperated to the
highest pitch sends forth a yellow liquor out of its
mouth, which they gather in small pots set underneath,
and afterwards coagulate into a body in the sun. This
they continue for several months together, by giving
daily food to the creature. It is unquestionably the
strongest poison in the world; its urine being of so corrosive
a quality, that it not only raises blisters, wherever
it touches the skin, but turns the flesh black, and causes
a gangrene.

the corpse at mid-day or afternoon prayers, to one or
other of these Mosques, from whence it is accompanied
by the greatest part of the congregation, to the grave.
Their processions, at these times, are not so slow and
solemn as in most parts of Christendom: for the whole
company make what haste they can, singing as they go
along, some select verses of their Coran. That absolute
submission which they pay to the will of God, allows
them not to use any consolatory words upon these occasions:
no loss or misfortune is to be hereupon regretted
or complained of: instead likewise of such
expressions of sorrow and condolence, as may regard the
deceased, the compliments turn upon the person, who is
the nearest concerned, a blessing (say his friends) be
upon your head.

All Mahometans inter the dead at the hour set apart
for prayer; the defunct is not kept in the house, except
he expires after sunset, but the Body is transported
to the Mosque, whither it is carried by those who are
going to prayer; each from a spirit of devotion is desirous
to carry in his turn. Women regularly go on
Friday to weep over, and pray at the sepulchres of the
dead, whose memory they hold dear.

This custom of crowding about a funeral contributes to
spread the plague in Turkey.&mdash;It is not many years
since, in some parts of Worcestershire, the mourners
were accustomed to kneel with their heads upon the
coffin during the burial service.
</p><p>
The fullest account of a Mohammedan funeral is in the
Lettres sur la Grece, of M. Guys. Chance made him
the spectator of a ceremony which the Moslem will
not suffer an Infidel to prophane by his presence.
</p><p>
&ldquo;About ten in the morning I saw the grave-digger at
work; the slaves and the women of the family were
seated in the burial ground, many other women arrived,
and then they all began to lament. After this prelude
they one after the other embraced one of the little pillars
which are placed upon the graves, crying out <i>Ogloum,
ogloum, s&#339;na Mussaphir gueldi</i>, My Son, my Son, a
guest is coming to see thee. At these words their tears
and sobs began anew; but the storm did not continue
long; they all seated themselves, and entered into conversation.
</p><p>
At noon I heard a confused noise, and cries of lamentation,
it was the funeral which arrived. A Turk preceded
it, bearing upon his head a small chest; four other
Turks carried the bier upon their shoulders, then came
the father, the relations and the friends of the dead in
great numbers. Their cries ceased at the entrance of the
burial ground, but then they quarrelled&mdash;and for
this. The man who bore the chest opened it, it was
filled with copies of the Koran, a croud of Turks,
young and old, threw themselves upon the books and
scrambled for them. Those who succeeded ranged
themselves around the Iman, and all at once began to
recite the Koran, almost as Boys say their lesson. Each
of the readers received ten parats, about fifteen sols,
wrapt in paper. It was then for these fifteen pence
that these pious assistants had quarrelled, and in our
own country you might have seen them fight for
less.
</p><p>
The bier was placed by the grave, in which the grave-digger
was still working, and perfumes were burnt by it.
After the reading of the Koran the Iman chanted some
Arabic prayers, and his full-chant would, no doubt,
have appeared to you, as it did to me, very ridiculous.
All the Turks were standing; they held their hands
open over the grave, and answered <i>Amen</i> to all the
prayers which the Iman addressed to God for the
deceased.
</p><p>
The prayers finished, a large chest was brought about
six feet long and three broad; its boards were very
thick. The coffin is usually made of cypress; thus
literally is verified the phrase of Horace that the cypress
is our last possession.
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Neque harum, quas colis, arborum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Te, pr&aelig;ter invisas cupressus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ulla brevem dominum sequetur.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
The cemeteries of the Turks are usually planted with
these trees, to which they have a religious attachment.
The chest which was in loose pieces, having been placed
in the grave, the coffin was laid in it, and above planks,
with other pieces of wood. Then all the Turks, taking
spades, cast earth upon the grave to cover it. This is
a part of the ceremony at which all the bystanders
assisted in their turn.
</p><p>
Before the corpse is buried it is carried to the Mosque.
Then after having recited the <i>Fatka</i> (a prayer very
similar to our Lord&rsquo;s prayer, which is repeated by all
present) the Iman asks the congregation what they have
to testify concerning the life and morals of the deceased.
Each then in his turn relates those good actions with
which he was acquainted. The body is then washed,
and wrapped up like a mummy, so that it cannot be
seen. Drugs and spices are placed in the bier with it,
and it is carried to interment. Before it is lowered
into the grave, the Iman commands silence, saying,
&ldquo;Cease your lamentations for a moment, and let me
instruct this Moslem how to act, when he arrives in
the other world.&rdquo; Then in the ear of the corpse, he
directs him how to answer the Evil Spirit who will not
fail to question him respecting his religion, &amp;c. This
lesson finished, he repeats the <i>Fatka</i> with all the assistants,
and the body is let down into the grave. After
they have thrown earth three times upon the grave, as
the Romans used, they retire. The Iman only remains,
he approaches the grave, stoops down, inclines his ear,
and listens to hear if the Dead disputes when the
Angel of Death comes to take him: then he bids him
farewell, and in order to be well paid, never fails to
report to the family the best news of the dead.</p></div>

city, but the great Turkish Emperors themselves, with

the Turks are buried in the fields; some of the better
sort in tombs of marble, but the rest with tomb-stones
laid upon them, or with two great stones, one set up at
the head and the other at the feet of every grave; the

of the nature of rain, as it did not run upon the ground,
but remained very light, having scarce the weight of
feathers, of a beautiful white colour like flower; it fell
in showers, and occasioned a darkness in the air more
than rain, and liker to mist. It covered the face of the
whole country for several days, retaining its whiteness
the whole time, then went away like dew, without
leaving any smell, or unwholsome effect behind it.

by De la Roque. <i>Voyage de Syrie &amp; du Mont Liban.</i>
1722.
</p><p>
&ldquo;This little forest is composed of twenty Cedars of a
prodigious size, so large indeed that the finest Planes,
Sycamores, and other large trees which we had seen
could not be compared with them. Besides these
principal Cedars, there were a great number of lesser
ones, and some very small, mingled with the large
trees, or in little clumps near them. They differed not
in their foliage, which resembles the Juniper, and is
green throughout the year: but the great Cedars spread at
their summit and form a perfect round, whereas the
small ones rise in a pyramidal form like the Cypress.
Both diffuse the same pleasant odour; the large ones
only yield fruit, a large cone in shape almost like that
of the Pine, but of a browner colour, and compacter
shell. It gives a very pleasant odour, and contains a
sort of thick and transparent balm, which oozes out
thro&rsquo; small apertures, and falls drop by drop. This
fruit which it is difficult to separate from the stalk, contains
a nut like that of the Cypress; it grows at the
end of the boughs, and turns its point upwards.
</p><p>
The nature of this tree is not to elevate its trunk, or the
part between the root and the first branches; for the
largest Cedars which we saw did not in the height of
their trunks exceed six or seven feet. From this low
but enormously thick body, prodigious branches rise,
spreading as they rise, and forming by the disposition
of their boughs and leaves which point upward, a sort
of wheel which appears to be the work of art. The
bark of the cedar, except at the trunk, is smooth and
shining, of a brown colour. Its wood white and soft
immediately under the bark, but hard and red within,
and very bitter, which renders it incorruptible and
almost immortal. A fragrant gum issues from the
tree.
</p><p>
The largest Cedar which we measured was seven feet
in circumference, wanting two inches, and the whole
extent of its branches, which it was easy to measure
from their perfect roundness, formed a circumference of
about 120 feet.
</p><p>
The Patriarch of the Maronites, fully persuaded of the
rarity of these Trees, and wishing by the preservation of
those that remain to shew his respect for a forest so
celebrated in Scripture has pronounced canonical pains,
and even excommunication against any Christians who
shall dare to cut them; scarcely will he permit a little
to be sometimes taken for Crucifixes and little tabernacles
in the chapels of our Missionaries.
</p><p>
The Maronites themselves have such a veneration for
these Cedars, that on the day of Transfiguration they
celebrate the festival under them with great solemnity,
the Patriarch officiates and says Mass pontifically, and
among other exercises of devotion they particularly
honour the Virgin Mary there, and sing her praises,
because she is compared to the Cedars of Lebanon, and
Lebanon itself used as a metaphor for the mother of
Christ.
</p>
<hr style='width: 15%;' />
<p>
The Maronites say that the snows have no sooner begun
to fall than these Cedars, whose boughs in their infinite
number are all so equal in height that they appear
to have been shorn, and form, as we have said, a sort
of wheel or parasol,&mdash;than these Cedars, I say, never
fail at that time to change their figure. The branches
which before spread themselves rise insensibly, gathering
together it may be said, and turn their points upward
towards Heaven, forming altogether a pyramid. It is
Nature, they say, who inspires this movement, and
makes them assume a new shape, without which these
Trees never could sustain the immense weight of snow,
remaining for so long a time.
</p><p>
I have procured more particular information of this fact,
and it has been confirmed by the testimony of many
persons, who have often witnessed it. This is what the
Secretary of the Maronite Patriarch wrote to me in one
of his letters, which I think it right to give in his own
words. <i>Cedri Libani quas plantavit Deus, ut Psalmist:
loquitur, sitae sunt in planitie qu&acirc;dam, aliquantulum infra
altissimum Montis-Libani cacumen, ubi tempore hyemali
maxima nivium quantitas descendit, tribusque &amp; ultra,
mensibus mordaciter dominatur. Cedri in altum ascendunt
extensis tamen ramis in gyrum solo parallelis, confioientibus
suo gyro fere umbellam solarem. Sed superveniente nive,
quia coacervaretur in magn&acirc; quantitate eos desuper, neque
possent pati tantum pondus tanto tempore premens, sine
certo fractionis discrimine, Natura, rerum omnium provida
mater, ipsis concessit, ut adveniente hyeme &amp; descendente
nive, statim rami in altum assurgant, &amp; secum invicem
uniti constituant quasi conum, ut melius sese ab adveniente
hoste tueantur. Natur&aacute; enim ips&acirc; verum est, virtutem
quamlebet unitam simul reddi fortiorem.</i>
</p><p>
The Cedars of Lebanon, which, as the Psalmist says,
God himself planted, are situated in a little plain,
somewhat below the loftiest summit of mount Lebanon,
where in the winter a great quantity of snow falls, and
continues for three months, or longer. The Cedars are
high, but their boughs spread out parallel with the
ground into a circle, forming almost a shield against the
sun. But when the snow falls, which would be heaped
upon them in so great a quantity, that they could not
endure such a weight so long a time, without the certain
danger of breaking, Nature, the provident mother of
all, has endued them with power, that when the winter
comes and the snow descends, their boughs immediately
rise, and uniting together form a cone, that they may be
the better defended from the coming Enemy. For in
Nature itself it is true, that virtue as it is united, becomes
stronger.</p></div>

for the superstition of the Persians will not let us know

where they might meet perhaps with something which
they should be unwilling to know.&rdquo;

At the coronation of this Prince two Astrologers were
to be present, with an Astrolabe in their hands, to take
the fortunate hour, as they term it, and observe the
lucky moments that a happy constellation should point
out for proceedings of that importance.

Sephie-Mirza having by debauchery materially injured

&ldquo;in regard his life depended upon the King&rsquo;s, or if his
life were spared yet he was sure to lose his estate and
his liberty, as happens to all those who attend the
Asiatic Sovereigns, when they die under their care.
The Queen Mother too accused him of treason or
ignorance, believing that since he was her Son&rsquo;s
Physician he was obliged to cure him. This made the
Physician at his wits end, so that all his receipts failing
him, he bethought himself of one that was peculiarly
his own invention, and which few physicians would ever
have found out, as not being to be met with neither in
Galen nor Hippocrates. What does he then do, but out
of an extraordinary fetch of his wit, he begins to lay the
fault upon the stars and the King&rsquo;s Astrologers, crying
out that they were altogether in the wrong, that if the
King lay in a languishing condition and could not
recover his health it was because they had failed to
observe the happy hour, or the Aspect of a fortunate
constellation at the time of his coronation.&rdquo; The stratagem
succeeded, the King was recrowned and by the

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_168_168" id="Footnote_168_168"></a><a href="#FNanchor_168_168"><span class="label">[168]</span></a> We have now to refute their errour who are persuaded
that Brazen Heads made under certain constellations may
give answers, and be as it were guides and
counsellors, upon all occasions, to those that had them
in their possession. Among these is one Yepes who
affirms that Henry de Villeine made such a one at
Madrid, broken to pieces afterwards by order of John 2.
King of Castile. The same thing is affirmed by Bartholomew
Sibillus, and the Author of the <i>Image of the
World</i>, of Virgil; by William of Malmsbury of Sylvester;
by John Gower of Robert of Lincoln; by the
common people of England of Roger Bacon; and by
Tostatus Bishop of Avilla, George of Venice, Delrio,
Sibillus, Raguseus, Delancre and others, too many to
mention, of Albertus Magnus; who as the most expert,
had made an entire man of the same metal, and had
spent thirty years without any interruption in forming
him under several aspects and constellations. For example,
he formed the eyes, according to the said Tostatus
in his commentaries upon Exodus, when the Sun was in a
sign of the Zodiac correspondent to that part, casting
them out of divers metals mixt together and mark&rsquo;d
with the characters of the same signs and planets, and
their several and necessary aspects. The same method
he observed in the head, neck, shoulders, thighs, and
legs, all which were fashioned at several times, and
being put and fastened together in the form of a man,
had the faculty to reveal to the said Albertus the
solutions of all his principal difficulties. To which they
add (that nothing be lost of the story of the statue)
that it was battered to pieces by St. Thomas, meerely
because he could not endure its excesse of prating.
</p><p>
But to give a more rational account of this Androides
of Albertus, as also of all these miraculous heads, I
conceive the original of this fable may well be deduced
from the Teraph of the Hebrews, by which as Mr. Selden
affirms, many are of opinion, that we must understand
what is said in Genesis concerning Laban&rsquo;s Gods, and in
the first book of Kings concerning the image which
Michol put into the bed in David&rsquo;s place. For R. Eleazar
holds that it was made of the head of a male child,
the first born and that dead-born, under whose tongue
they applyed a lamen of Gold, whereon were engraved
the characters and inscriptions of certain planets, which
the Jews superstitiously wandered up and down with,
instead of the Urim and Thummim, or the Ephod of
the High Priest. And that this original is true and
well deduced, there is a manifest indicium, in that
Henry D&rsquo;Assia, and Bartholom&aelig;us Sibillus affirm, that
the Androides of Albertus, and the Head made
by Virgil, were composed of flesh and bone, yet
not by nature, but by art. But this being judged impossible
by modern Authors, and the vertue of Images,
Annulets, and planetary Sigills being in great reputation,
men have thought ever since (taking their opinion from
Trismegistus affirming in his Asclepion, that of the
Gods, some were made by the Sovereign God, and
others by men, who, by some art, had the power to
unite the invisible Spirits to things visible and corporeal,
as is explained at large by St. Augustine) that such
figures were made of copper or some other metal,
whereon men had wrought under some favourable
Aspects of Heaven and the planets.
</p><p>
My design is not absolutely to deny that he might compose
some head or statue of man, like that of Memnon,
from which proceeded a small sound and pleasant
noise, when the rising Sun came by his heat to rarify
and force out, by certain small conduits, the air which
in the cold of the night was condensed within it. Or
haply they might be like those statues of Boetius,
whereof Cassiodorus speaking said, <i>Metalla mugiunt</i>,
<i>Diomedis in &aelig;re grues buccinant, &aelig;nus anguis insibilat,
aves simulat&aelig; fritinniunt, et qu&aelig; propriam vocem nesciunt,
ab &aelig;re dulcedinem probantur emittere cantilen&aelig;</i>; for such
I doubt not but may be made by the help of that part
of Natural Magic which depends on the Mathematics.

creed. Mohammed borrowed it from the Persians.
I know not from whence the Monks introduced it;
probably they were ignorant enough to have invented
the obvious fiction.
</p><p>
In the Vision of Thurcillus the ceremony is accurately
described. &ldquo;At the end of the north wall, within the
church, sate St. Paul, and opposite him, without, was
the Devil and his Angels. At the feet of the Devil a
burning pit flamed up, which was the mouth of the
Pit of Hell. A Balance equally poised, was fixed upon
the wall between the Devil and the Apostle, one scale
hanging before each. The Apostle had two weights,
a greater and a less, all shining and like gold, and the
Devil also had two smoky and black ones. Therefore
the Souls that were all black came one after another,
with great fear and trembling, to behold the weighing
of their good and evil works: for these weights weighed
the works of all the souls, according to the good or evil
which they had done. When the scale inclined to the
Apostle, he took the Soul, and introduced it thro&rsquo; the
Eastern gate, into the fire of Purgatory, that there it
might expiate its crimes. But when the scale inclined
and sunk towards the Devil, then he and his Angels
snatched the soul miserably howling and cursing the
father and mother that begot it to eternal torments, and
cast it with laughter and grinning into the deep and
fiery pit which was at the feet of the Devil. Of this
Balance of good and evil much may be found in the
writings of the holy Fathers.&rdquo;
</p><p class="ralign"><i>Matthew Paris.</i>
</p><p>
&ldquo;Concerning the salvation of Charlemagne, Archbishop
Turpin, a man of holy life, wrote thus. &ldquo;I, Turpin,
Archbishop of Rheims, being in my chamber, in the
city of Vienna, saying my prayers, saw a legion of Devils
in the air, who were making a great noise. I adjured
one of them to tell me from whence they came, and
wherefore they made so great an uproar. And he replied
that they came from Aix la Chapelle, where a great
Lord had died, and that they were returning in anger
because they had not been able to carry away his soul.
I asked him who the great Lord was, and why they had
not been able to carry away his soul. He replied that it
was Charlemagne, and that Saint Jago had been greatly
against them. And I asked him how St. Jago had been
against them; and he replied, we were weighing the
good and the evil which he had done in this world,
and Saint Jago brought so much timber and so many
stones from the churches which he had founded in his
name, that they greatly over-balanced all his evil
works; and so we had no power over his soul. And
having said this the Devil disappeared.&rdquo;
</p><p>
We must understand from this vision of Archbishop Turpin,
that they who build or repair churches in this world,
erect resting places and inns for their salvation.

Two other corollaries follow from the vision. The Devil&rsquo;s
way home from Aix la Chapelle lay thro&rsquo; Vienna;&mdash;and
as churches go by weight, an architect of Sir John
Vanbrugh&rsquo;s school should always be employed.&rdquo;
</p><p>
This Balance of the Dead was an easy and apt metaphor,
but clumsily imagined as an actual mode of
trial.

The classical reader will remember the equivocations
of Apollo, the fable of the young man and the
Lion in the tapestry will be more generally recollected:
we have many buildings in England to which this story
has been applied,&mdash;Cook&rsquo;s Folly near Bristol derives its
name from a similar tradition.
</p><p>
The History of the Buccaneers affords a remarkable
instance of prophecy occasioning its own accomplishment.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Before my first going over into the <i>South-Seas</i> with
Captain <i>Sharp</i> (and indeed before any Privateers, at
least since <i>Drake</i> and <i>Oxengham</i>) had gone that way
which we afterwards went, except <i>La Sound</i>, a <i>French</i>
Captain, who by Capt. <i>Wright&rsquo;s</i> instructions had ventured
as far as <i>Cheapo</i> town with a body of men, but
was driven back again, I being then on board Capt.
<i>Coxon</i>, in company with three or four more Privateers,
about four leagues to the East of <i>Portobel</i>, we took the
packets bound thither from <i>Carthagena</i>. We opened a
great quantity of the Merchant&rsquo;s letters, and found the
contents of many of them to be very surprizing, the
Merchants of several parts of <i>Old-Spain</i> thereby informing
their correspondents of <i>Panama</i>, and elsewhere, of a
certain prophecy that went about <i>Spain</i> that year,
the tenor of which was, <i>that there would be</i> English
<i>privateers that year in the</i> West-Indies, <i>who would make
such great discoveries, as to open a door into the</i> South-Seas;
which they supposed was fastest shut: and the
letters were accordingly full of cautions to their friends
to be very watchful and careful of their coasts.
</p><p>
This door they spake of we all concluded must be the
passage over land through the country of the <i>Indians</i> of
<i>Darien</i>, who were a little before this become our friends,
and had lately fallen out with the <i>Spaniards</i>, breaking
off the intercourse which for some time they had with
them: And upon calling also to mind the frequent
invitations we had from those <i>Indians</i> a little before this
time, to pass through their Country, and fall upon the
<i>Spaniards</i> in the <i>South-Seas</i>, we from henceforward
began to entertain such thoughts in earnest, and soon
came to a resolution to make those attempts which we
afterwards did with Capt. <i>Sharp, Coxon, &amp;c.</i> So that
the taking these letters gave the first life to those bold
undertakings: And we took the advantage of the fears
the <i>Spaniards</i> were in from that prophecy, or probable
conjecture, or whatever it were; for we sealed up most
of the letters again, and sent them ashore to <i>Portobel</i>.

Mohammedans to animate green Birds in the Groves
of Paradise. Was this opinion invented to conciliate
the Pagan Arabs, who believed, that of the Blood near
the dead person&rsquo;s brain was formed a Bird named
Hamah, which once in a hundred years visited the
sepulchre?
</p><p>
To this there is an allusion in the Moallakat. &ldquo;Then
I knew with certainty, that, in so fierce a contest
with them, many a heavy blow would make the
Perched Birds of the Brain fly quickly from every
Skull.&rdquo;
</p><p class="ralign"><i>Poem of Antara.</i>
</p><p>
In the Bahar-Danush, Parrots are called the green-vested
resemblers of Heaven&rsquo;s dwellers. The following passages
in the same work may perhaps allude to the same
superstition, or perhaps are merely metaphorical, in the
usual stile of its true Oriental bombast. &ldquo;The Bird of
Understanding fled from the nest of my brain.&rdquo; &ldquo;My
joints and members seemed as if they would separate from
each other, and the Bird of Life would quit the nest of
my Body.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Bird of my Soul became a captive
in the net of her glossy ringlets.&rdquo;
</p><p>
I remember in a European Magazine two similar lines
by the Author of the Lives of the Admirals.

<p>
The Grave of Francisco Jorge, the Maronite Martyr,
was visited by two strange Birds of unusual size. No one
knew whence they came. They emblemed, says
Vasconcellos, the purity and the indefatigable activity of
his soul.
</p><p>
The inhabitants of Otaheite have assigned a less respectable
part of the Body, as the Seat of the Soul.
</p><p>
The disembowelling of the body there, is always performed
in great secrecy, and with much religious superstition.
The bowels are, by these people, considered as the
immediate organs of sensation, where the first impressions
are received, and by which all the operations of the
mind are carried on: it is therefore natural to conclude,
that they may esteem, and venerate the intestines, as
bearing the greatest affinity to the immortal part. I
have frequently held conversations on this subject, with
a view to convince them, that all intellectual operations
were carried on in the head; at which they would
generally smile, and intimate, that they had frequently
seen men recover whose skulls had been fractured, and
whose heads had otherways been much injured; but
that, in all cases in which the intestines had been
wounded, the persons on a certainty died. Other arguments
they would also advance in favour of their
belief; such as the effect of fear, and other passions,
which caused great agitation and uneasiness, and would
sometimes produce sickness at the stomach, which they
attributed intirely to the action of the bowels.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_174_174" id="Footnote_174_174"></a><a href="#FNanchor_174_174"><span class="label">[174]</span></a> When Hosein the son of Ali was sick of a grievous
disorder, he longed for a pomegranate, tho&rsquo; that fruit
was not then in season. Ali went out, and diligently
enquiring found a single one in the possession of a Jew.
As he returned with it, a sick man met him and begged
half the pomegranate, saying it would restore his health.
Ali gave him half, and when he had eaten it, the man
requested he would give him the other half, the sooner
to complete his recovery. Ali benignantly complied,
returned to his son and told him what had happened,
and Hosein approved what his father had done.
</p><p>
Immediately behold a miracle! as they were talking
together the door was gently knocked at. He ordered
the woman servant to go there, and she found a man,
of all men the most beautiful, who had a plate in his
hand covered with green silk, in which were ten pomegranates.
The woman was astonished at the beauty of
the man and of the pomegranates, and she took one of
them and hid it, and carried the other nine to Aly, who
kissed the present. When he had counted them he
found that one was wanting, and said so to the servant,
she confessed that she had taken it on account of its
excellence, and Ali gave her her liberty. The Pomegranates
were from Paradise, Hosein was cured of
his disease only by their odour, and rose up immediately,
recovered, and in full strength.
</p><p class="ralign"><i>Maracci.</i>
</p><p>
I suspect, says Maracci, that this is a true miracle
wrought by some Christian Saint, and falsely attributed
to Ali. However this may be, it does not appear
absurd that God should by some especial favour reward
an act of remarkable charity even in an Infidel, as
he has sometimes by a striking chastisement punished
enormous crimes. But the assertion that the Pomegranates
were sent from Paradise, exposes the fable.
</p><p>
Maracci after detailing and ridiculing the Mohammedan
miracles, contrasts with them in an appendix a few of
the real and permanent miracles of Christianity which
are proved by the testimony of the whole world. He
selects five as examples. 1. The Chapel of Loretto,
brought by angels from Nazareth to Illyricum, and from
Illyricum to Italy; faithful messengers having been
sent to both places, and finding in both its old foundations,
in dimensions and materials, exactly corresponding.
</p><p>
2. The cross of St. Thomas in Urbe Malipuritana
(Masulipatan) in the E. Indies. A Bramin, as the Saint
was extended upon his cross in prayer, slew him. On
the anniversary of his martyrdom, during the celebration
of Mass, the cross gradually becomes luminous,
till it shines one white glory. At elevating the host it
resumes its natural colour, and sweats blood profusely,
in which the faithful dip their clothes, by which many
miracles are wrought.
</p><p>
3. <i>Certissimum quia evidentissimum</i>&mdash;at <i>Barii</i> (Bari on
the Adriatic) in Apulia a liquor flows from the bones of
St. Nicholas, they call it St. Nicholas&rsquo;s manna, which
being preserved in bottles never corrupts or breeds
worms&mdash;except the possessor be corrupt himself&mdash;and
daily it works miracles.
</p><p>
4. At Tolentinum (Tolentino in the Marche of Anconia)
the arms of St. Nicholas swell with blood, and pour
out copious streams&mdash;when any great calamity impends
over Christendom.
</p><p>
5. The blood of St. Jaunarius at Naples.
</p><p>
These, says Maracci, are <i>miracula perseverantia</i>, permanent
miracles&mdash;and it cannot be said as of the
Mohammedan ones, that they are tricks of the Devil.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_175_175" id="Footnote_175_175"></a><a href="#FNanchor_175_175"><span class="label">[175]</span></a> In the Bahar-Danush the Simorg is mentioned as a
genus&mdash;not an individual, this is heresy,&mdash;the unity of
the Simorg being expressed in all the books of canonical
Romance.
</p><p>
The Simorg is a monstrous Bird like a Griffin; in <i>the
History of Caherman</i>, he is made to say, That he had
existed through all the revolutions of ages and of created
things, which passed before the time of Adam. These
created things were reasonable beings, but had not
human shape. They were governed by the various
Solomons mentioned in the note Vol. I. Page 214.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_176_176" id="Footnote_176_176"></a><a href="#FNanchor_176_176"><span class="label">[176]</span></a> Araf is a place between the Paradise and the Hell
of the Mohammedans, some deem it a veil of separation,
some a strong wall; others hold it to be a
Purgatory in which those believers will remain, whose
good and evil works have been so equal that they were
neither virtuous enough to enter Paradise, nor guilty
enough to be condemned to the fire of Hell. From
thence they see the glory of the Blessed, and are near
enough to congratulate them; but their ardent desire to
partake the same happiness becomes a great pain.
At length at the Day of Judgement, when all men
before they are judged, shall be cited to render homage
to their Creator, those who are here confined shall
prostrate themselves before the face of the Lord,
in adoration: and by this act of religion which shall
be accounted a merit, the number of their good
works will exceed their evil ones, and they will enter
into glory.
</p><p>
Saadi says that Araf appears a hell to the happy, and
a Paradise to the damned.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
