  <div type="preface"><head>PREFACE</head>


<p>In the continuation of the Arabian Tales,
the Domdaniel is mentioned; a Seminary
for evil Magicians under the Roots of the
Sea. From this seed the present Romance
has grown. Let me not be supposed to
prefer the metre in which it is written, abstractedly
considered, to the regular blank
verse; the noblest measure, in my judgement,
of which our admirable language
is capable. For the following Poem I
have preferred it, because it suits the varied
subject; it is the <hi rend="italic">Arabesque</hi> ornament of an
Arabian tale.</p>

<p>The dramatic sketches of Dr. Sayer, a
volume which no lover of poetry will recollect
without pleasure, induced me when a
young versifier, to practise in this metre.
I felt that while it gave the poet a wider
range of expression, it satisfied the ear of
the reader. It were easy to make a parade
of learning by enumerating the various
feet which it admits; it is only needful to
observe that no two lines are employed in
<hi rend="italic">sequence</hi> which can be read into one. Two
six-syllable lines (it will perhaps be answered)
compose an Alexandrine: the
truth is that the Alexandrine, when harmonious,
is composed of two six-syllable
lines.</p>

<p>One advantage this metre assuredly possesses;
the dullest reader cannot distort
it into discord: he may read it with a
<hi rend="italic">prose mouth</hi>, but its flow and fall will still
be perceptible. Verse is not enough favoured
by the English reader: perhaps
this is owing to the obtrusiveness, the regular
Jews-harp <hi rend="italic">twing-twang</hi>, of what has
been foolishly called heroic measure. I
do not wish the <hi rend="italic">improvisatorè</hi> tune, but
something that denotes the sense of harmony,
something like the accent of feeling;
like the tone which every Poet necessarily
gives to Poetry.</p>

<lg>
<l rend="i4">How beautiful is night!</l>
<l rend="i0">A dewy freshness fills the silent air,</l>
<l rend="i2">No mist obscures, no little cloud</l>
<l rend="i2">Breaks the whole serene of heaven:</l>
<l rend="i0">In full-orbed glory the majestic moon</l>
<l rend="i4">Rolls thro the dark blue depths.</l>
<l rend="i4">Beneath her steady ray</l>
<l rend="i4">The desert circle spreads,</l>
<l rend="i0">Like the round ocean, girdled with the sky.</l>
<l rend="i4">How beautiful is night!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Who at this untimely hour</l>
<l rend="i2">Wanders o'er the desert sands?</l>
<l rend="i4">No station is in view,</l>
<l rend="i0">No palm-grove islanded amid the waste.</l>
<l rend="i4">The mother and her child,</l>
<l rend="i0">The widow and the orphan at this hour</l>
<l rend="i2">Wander o'er the desert sands.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Alas! the setting sun</l>
<l rend="i4">Saw Zeinab in her bliss,</l>
<l rend="i4">Hodeirah's wife beloved.</l>
<l rend="i4">Alas! the wife beloved,</l>
<l rend="i4">The fruitful mother late,</l>
<l rend="i0">Whom when the daughters of Arabia named</l>
<l rend="i4">They wished their lot like her's;</l>
<l rend="i2">She wanders o'er the desert sands</l>
<l rend="i4">A wretched widow now,</l>
<l rend="i0">The fruitful mother of so fair a race,</l>
<l rend="i4">With only one preserved,</l>
<l rend="i2">She wanders o'er the wilderness.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">No tear relieved the burthen of her heart;</l>
<l rend="i0">Stunned with the heavy woe she felt like one</l>
<l rend="i0">Half-wakened from a midnight dream of blood.</l>
<l rend="i4">But sometimes when her boy</l>
<l rend="i4">Would wet her hand with tears,</l>
<l rend="i0">And looking up to her fixed countenance,</l>
<l rend="i4">Amid his bursting sobs</l>
<l rend="i0">Say the dear name of <hi rend="smallcap">Mother</hi>, then would she</l>
<l rend="i4">Utter a feeble groan.</l>
<l rend="i0">At length collecting, Zeinab turned her eyes</l>
<l rend="i0">To heaven, exclaiming, "praised be the Lord!</l>
<l rend="i4">"He gave,<ptr target="#FNanchor_1_1"/> he takes away,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Lord our God is good!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"Good is he?" cried the boy,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Why are my brethren and my sisters slain?</l>
<l rend="i4">"Why is my father killed?</l>
<l rend="i2">"Did ever we neglect our prayers,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Or ever lift a hand unclean to heaven?</l>
<l rend="i2">"Did ever stranger from our tent</l>
<l rend="i4">"Unwelcomed turn away?</l>
<l rend="i4">"Mother, he is not good!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Then Zeinab beat her breast in agony,</l>
<l rend="i4">"O God forgive my child!</l>
<l rend="i4">"He knows not what he says!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Thou know'st I did not teach him thoughts like these,</l>
<l rend="i2">"O Prophet, pardon him!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">She had not wept till that assuaging prayer....</l>
<l rend="i0">The fountains of her eyes were opened then,</l>
<l rend="i4">And tears relieved her heart.</l>
<l rend="i2">She raised her swimming eyes to Heaven,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Allah, thy will be done!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Beneath the dispensation of thy wrath</l>
<l rend="i4">"I groan, but murmur not.</l>
<l rend="i2">"The Day of the Trial will come,</l>
<l rend="i0">"When I shall understand how profitable</l>
<l rend="i4">"It is to suffer now."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Young Thalaba in silence heard reproof,</l>
<l rend="i2">His brow in manly frowns was knit,</l>
<l rend="i2">With manly thoughts his heart was full.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Tell me who slew my father?" cried the boy.</l>
<l rend="i4">Zeinab replied and said,</l>
<l rend="i0">"I knew not that there lived thy father's foe.</l>
<l rend="i2">"The blessings of the poor for him</l>
<l rend="i4">"Went daily up to Heaven,</l>
<l rend="i0">"In distant lands the traveller told his praise.</l>
<l rend="i4">"I did not think there lived</l>
<l rend="i4">"Hodeirah's enemy."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"But I will hunt him thro' the earth!"</l>
<l rend="i4">Young Thalaba exclaimed.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Already I can bend my father's bow,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Soon will my arm have strength</l>
<l rend="i0">"To drive the arrow-feathers to his heart."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Zeinab replied, "O Thalaba, my child,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Thou lookest on to distant days,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And we are in the desert far from men!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Not till that moment her afflicted heart</l>
<l rend="i4">Had leisure for the thought.</l>
<l rend="i4">She cast her eyes around,</l>
<l rend="i4">Alas! no tents were there</l>
<l rend="i4">Beside the bending sands;</l>
<l rend="i0">No palm tree rose to spot the wilderness.</l>
<l rend="i4">The dark blue sky closed round</l>
<l rend="i4">And rested<ptr target="#FNanchor_2_2"/> like a dome</l>
<l rend="i4">Upon the circling waste.</l>
<l rend="i4">She cast her eyes around,</l>
<l rend="i4">Famine and Thirst were there.</l>
<l rend="i2">Then the mother bowed her head,</l>
<l rend="i4">And wept upon her child.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i3">... Sudden a cry of wonder</l>
<l rend="i4">From Thalaba aroused her,</l>
<l rend="i4">She raised her head, and saw</l>
<l rend="i0">Where high in air a stately palace rose.</l>
<l rend="i4">Amid a grove embowered</l>
<l rend="i4">Stood the prodigious pile,</l>
<l rend="i2">Trees of such ancient majesty</l>
<l rend="i2">Towered not on Yemen's happy hills,</l>
<l rend="i0">Nor crowned the stately brow of Lebanon.</l>
<l rend="i0">Fabric so vast, so lavishly enriched,</l>
<l rend="i0">For Idol, or for Tyrant, never yet</l>
<l rend="i4">Raised the slave race of men</l>
<l rend="i0">In Rome, nor in the elder Babylon,</l>
<l rend="i4">Nor old Persepolis,</l>
<l rend="i2">Nor where the family of Greece</l>
<l rend="i4">Hymned Eleutherian Jove.</l>
<l rend="i2">Here studding azure<ptr target="#FNanchor_3_3"/> tablatures</l>
<l rend="i4">And rayed with feeble light,</l>
<l rend="i0">Star-like the ruby and the diamond shone:</l>
<l rend="i4">Here on the golden towers</l>
<l rend="i4">The yellow moon-beam lay;</l>
<l rend="i0">Here with white splendour floods the silver wall.</l>
<l rend="i0">Less wonderous pile and less magnificent</l>
<l rend="i0">Sennamar<ptr target="#FNanchor_4_4"/> built at Hirah, tho' his art</l>
<l rend="i0">Sealed with one stone the ample edifice</l>
<l rend="i0">And made its colours, like the serpents skin</l>
<l rend="i0">Play with a changeful beauty: him, its Lord</l>
<l rend="i0">Jealous lest after-effort might surpass</l>
<l rend="i0">The now unequalled palace, from its height</l>
<l rend="i4">Dashed on the pavement down.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">They entered, and through aromatic paths</l>
<l rend="i4">Wondering they went along.</l>
<l rend="i2">At length upon a mossy bank</l>
<l rend="i2">Beneath a tall mimosa's shade</l>
<l rend="i0">That o'er him bent its living canopy,</l>
<l rend="i4">They saw a man reclined.</l>
<l rend="i0">Young he appeared, for on his cheek there shone</l>
<l rend="i4">The morning glow of health,</l>
<l rend="i0">And the brown beard curled close around his chin.</l>
<l rend="i4">He slept, but at the sound</l>
<l rend="i0">Of coming feet awakening, fixed his eyes</l>
<l rend="i0">In wonder, on the wanderer and her child.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Forgive us," Zeinab cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Distress hath made us bold.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Relieve the widow and the fatherless.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Blessed are they who succour the distrest</l>
<l rend="i0">"For them hath God appointed Paradise."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">He heard, and he looked up to heaven,</l>
<l rend="i4">And tears ran down his cheeks:</l>
<l rend="i4">"It is a human voice!</l>
<l rend="i4">"I thank thee, O my God!</l>
<l rend="i4">"How many an age has past</l>
<l rend="i0">"Since the sweet sounds have visited mine ear!</l>
<l rend="i4">"I thank thee, O my God,</l>
<l rend="i4">"It is a human voice!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">To Zeinab turning then he cried</l>
<l rend="i4">"O mortal who art thou</l>
<l rend="i4">"Whose gifted eyes have pierced</l>
<l rend="i0">"The shadow of concealment that hath wrapt</l>
<l rend="i4">"These bowers, so many an age,</l>
<l rend="i4">"From eye of mortal man?</l>
<l rend="i4">"For countless years have past</l>
<l rend="i4">"And never foot of man</l>
<l rend="i4">"The bowers of Irem trod.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Save only I, a miserable wretch</l>
<l rend="i4">"From Heaven and Earth shut out!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Fearless, and scarce surprized,</l>
<l rend="i4">For grief in Zeinab's soul</l>
<l rend="i0">All other feebler feelings overpowered,</l>
<l rend="i4">She answered, "Yesterday</l>
<l rend="i4">"I was a wife beloved,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The fruitful mother of a numerous race.</l>
<l rend="i4">"I am a widow now,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Of all my offspring this alone is left.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Praise to the Lord our God,</l>
<l rend="i4">"He gave, he takes away!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Then said the stranger, "Not by Heaven unseen</l>
<l rend="i4">"Nor with unguided feet</l>
<l rend="i2">"Thy steps have reached this secret place</l>
<l rend="i2">"Nor for light purpose is the Veil,</l>
<l rend="i0">"That from the Universe hath long shut out</l>
<l rend="i4">"These ancient bowers, withdrawn.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Hear thou my words, O mortal, in thy heart</l>
<l rend="i2">"Treasure the wonders I shall tell;</l>
<l rend="i4">"And when amid the world</l>
<l rend="i4">"Thou shall emerge again</l>
<l rend="i4">"Repeat the warning tale.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Why have the Fathers suffered, but to make</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Children wisely safe?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"The Paradise of Irem<ptr target="#FNanchor_5_5"/> this,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And that the palace pile</l>
<l rend="i4">"Which Shedad built, the King.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Alas! in the days of my youth</l>
<l rend="i2">"The hum of the populous world</l>
<l rend="i2">"Was heard in yon wilderness waste!</l>
<l rend="i4">"O'er all the winding sands<ptr target="#FNanchor_6_6"/></l>
<l rend="i4">"The tents of Ad were pitch'd;</l>
<l rend="i4">"Happy Al-Ahkaf then,</l>
<l rend="i2">"For many and brave were her sons,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Her daughters were many and fair.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"My name was Aswad then.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Alas! alas! how strange</l>
<l rend="i4">"The sound so long unheard!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Of noble race I came,</l>
<l rend="i0">"One of the wealthy of the earth my Sire,</l>
<l rend="i0">"An hundred horses in my father's stalls</l>
<l rend="i4">"Stood ready for his will;</l>
<l rend="i4">"Numerous his robes of silk,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The number of his camels was not known.</l>
<l rend="i4">"These were my heritance,</l>
<l rend="i4">"O God! thy gifts were these;</l>
<l rend="i0">"But better had it been for Aswad's soul</l>
<l rend="i4">"To have asked alms on earth,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And begged the crumbs that from his table fell,</l>
<l rend="i4">"So he had known thy word.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"Boy who hast reached this solitude,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Fear the Lord in the days of thy youth!</l>
<l rend="i4">"My knee was never taught</l>
<l rend="i4">"To bend before my God,</l>
<l rend="i4">"My voice was never taught</l>
<l rend="i4">"To shape one holy prayer.</l>
<l rend="i2">"We worshipped Idols, wood and stone,</l>
<l rend="i2">"The work of our own foolish hands</l>
<l rend="i2">"We worshipped in our foolishness.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Vainly the Prophet's voice</l>
<l rend="i4">"Its frequent warning raised,</l>
<l rend="i4">"<hi rend="smallcap">Repent, and be forgiven!</hi>"—</l>
<l rend="i2">"We mocked the messenger of God,</l>
<l rend="i0">"We mocked the Lord, long-suffering, slow to wrath.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"A mighty work the pride of Shedad planned,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Here in the wilderness to form</l>
<l rend="i2">"A garden more surpassing fair</l>
<l rend="i4">"Than that before whose gate,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The lightning of the Cherub's fiery sword</l>
<l rend="i4">"Waves wide to bar access</l>
<l rend="i0">"Since Adam, the transgressor, thence was driven.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Here too would Shedad build</l>
<l rend="i4">"A kingly pile sublime,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The palace of his pride.</l>
<l rend="i4">"For this exhausted mines</l>
<l rend="i4">"Supplied their golden store,</l>
<l rend="i0">"For this the central caverns gave their gems;</l>
<l rend="i4">"For this the woodman's axe</l>
<l rend="i0">"Opened the cedar forest to the sun;</l>
<l rend="i4">"The silkworm of the East</l>
<l rend="i4">"Spun her sepulchral egg;</l>
<l rend="i4">"The hunter African</l>
<l rend="i0">"Provoked the danger of the elephant's wrath;</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Ethiop, keen of scent</l>
<l rend="i4">"Detects the ebony,<ptr target="#FNanchor_7_7"/></l>
<l rend="i2">"That deep-inearthed, and hating light,</l>
<l rend="i0">"A leafless tree and barren of all fruit,</l>
<l rend="i0">"With darkness feeds her boughs of raven grain....</l>
<l rend="i0">"Such were the treasures lavished in yon pile;</l>
<l rend="i4">"Ages have past away</l>
<l rend="i4">"And never mortal eye</l>
<l rend="i4">"Gazed on their vanity.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"The garden's copious springs</l>
<l rend="i4">"Blest that delightful spot,</l>
<l rend="i2">"And every flower was planted here</l>
<l rend="i2">"That makes the gale of evening sweet.</l>
<l rend="i0">"He spake, and bade the full-grown forest rise</l>
<l rend="i2">"His own creation; should the King</l>
<l rend="i4">"Wait for slow Nature's work?</l>
<l rend="i2">"All trees that bend with luscious fruit,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Or wave with feathery boughs,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Or point their spiring heads to heaven,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Or spreading wide their shadowy arms</l>
<l rend="i0">"Invite the traveller to repose at noon,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Hither, uprooted with their native soil,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The labour and the pain of multitudes,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Mature in beauty, bore them.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Here, frequent in the walks</l>
<l rend="i4">"The marble statue stood</l>
<l rend="i4">"Of heroes and of chiefs.</l>
<l rend="i4">"The trees and flowers remain</l>
<l rend="i0">"By Nature's care perpetuate and self-sown.</l>
<l rend="i0">"The marble statues long have lost all trace</l>
<l rend="i4">"Of heroes and of chiefs,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Huge shapeless stones they lie</l>
<l rend="i4">"O'er-grown with many a flower.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"The work of pride went on....</l>
<l rend="i4">"Often the Prophet's voice</l>
<l rend="i4">"Denounced impending woe....</l>
<l rend="i2">"We mocked at the words of the Seer.</l>
<l rend="i2">"We mocked at the wrath of the Lord.</l>
<l rend="i0">"A long continued drought first troubled us,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Three years no cloud had formed,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Three years no rain had fallen.</l>
<l rend="i4">"The wholesome herb was dry,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The corn matured not for the food of man,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The wells and fountains failed.</l>
<l rend="i0">"O hard of heart, in whom the punishment</l>
<l rend="i4">"Awoke no sense of guilt!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Headstrong to ruin, obstinately blind,</l>
<l rend="i2">"To Idols<ptr target="#FNanchor_8_8"/> we applied for aid;</l>
<l rend="i2">"Sakia we invoked for rain,</l>
<l rend="i2">"We called on Razeka for food....</l>
<l rend="i0">"They did not hear our prayers, they could not hear!</l>
<l rend="i4">"No cloud appeared in Heaven,</l>
<l rend="i4">"No nightly dews came down.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Then to the place of concourse,<ptr target="#FNanchor_9_9"/> messengers</l>
<l rend="i0">"Were sent to Mecca, where the nations came,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Round the Red Hillock, kneeling, to implore</l>
<l rend="i4">"God in his favoured place,</l>
<l rend="i4">"We sent to call on God;</l>
<l rend="i0">"Ah fools! unthinking that from all the earth</l>
<l rend="i4">"The heart ascends to him.</l>
<l rend="i4">"We sent to call on God;</l>
<l rend="i4">"Ah fools! to think the Lord</l>
<l rend="i4">"Would hear their prayers abroad</l>
<l rend="i4">"Who made no prayers at home!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"Meantime the work of pride went on,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And still before our Idols, wood and stone,</l>
<l rend="i4">"We bowed the impious knee.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Turn men of Ad, and call upon the Lord,"</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Prophet Houd exclaimed.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Turn men of Ad and look to Heaven,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And fly the wrath to come.</l>
<l rend="i4">"We mocked the Prophet's words;</l>
<l rend="i4">"Now dost thou dream old man.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Or art thou drunk with wine?</l>
<l rend="i2">"Future woe and wrath to come,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Still thy prudent voice forebodes;</l>
<l rend="i2">"When it comes will we believe,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Till it comes will we go on</l>
<l rend="i2">"In the way our fathers went.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Now are thy words from God?</l>
<l rend="i4">"Or dost thou dream, old man,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Or art thou drunk with wine?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"So spake the stubborn race</l>
<l rend="i4">"The unbelieving ones,</l>
<l rend="i0">"I too of stubborn unbelieving heart</l>
<l rend="i4">"Heard him and heeded not.</l>
<l rend="i0">"It chanced my father went the way of man,</l>
<l rend="i4">"He perished in his sins.</l>
<l rend="i2">"The funeral rites were duly paid,</l>
<l rend="i2">"We bound a camel to his grave</l>
<l rend="i4">"And left it there to die,</l>
<l rend="i2">"So if the resurrection<ptr target="#FNanchor_10_10"/> came</l>
<l rend="i4">"Together they might rise.</l>
<l rend="i4">"I past my father's grave,</l>
<l rend="i4">"I heard the Camel moan.</l>
<l rend="i4">"She was his favourite beast,</l>
<l rend="i0">"One that carried me in infancy,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The first that by myself I learnt to mount.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Her limbs were lean with famine, and her eyes</l>
<l rend="i4">"Looked ghastlily with want.</l>
<l rend="i4">"She knew me as I past,</l>
<l rend="i4">"She stared<ptr target="#FNanchor_11_11"/> me in the face,</l>
<l rend="i0">"My heart was touched, had it been human else?</l>
<l rend="i0">"I thought no eye was near, and broke her bonds,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And drove her forth to liberty and life.</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Prophet Houd beheld,</l>
<l rend="i4">"He lifted up his voice,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Blessed art thou, young man,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Blessed art thou, O Aswad, for the deed!</l>
<l rend="i2">"In the day of visitation,</l>
<l rend="i2">"In the fearful hour of judgment,</l>
<l rend="i4">"God will remember thee!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"The day of visitation was at hand,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The fearful hour of judgment hastened on.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Lo Shedad's mighty pile complete,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The palace of his pride.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Would ye behold its wonders, enter in!</l>
<l rend="i2">"I have no heart to visit it!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Time hath not harmed the eternal monument,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Time is not here, nor days, nor months, nor years,</l>
<l rend="i0">"An everlasting <hi rend="smallcap">now</hi> of misery!...</l>
<l rend="i4">"Ye must have heard their fame,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Or likely ye have seen</l>
<l rend="i4">"The mighty Pyramids,</l>
<l rend="i0">"For sure those mighty piles shall overlive</l>
<l rend="i0">"The feeble generations of mankind.</l>
<l rend="i0">"What tho' unmoved they bore<ptr target="#FNanchor_12_12"/> the deluge weight,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Survivors of the ruined world?</l>
<l rend="i0">"What tho' their founder filled with miracles</l>
<l rend="i0">"And wealth miraculous their ample vaults?</l>
<l rend="i0">"Compared with yonder fabric, and they shrink</l>
<l rend="i0">"The baby wonders of a woman's work!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Her emerald columns o'er the marble courts</l>
<l rend="i0">"Fling their green rays, as when amid a shower</l>
<l rend="i0">"The sun shines loveliest on the vernal corn.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Here Shedad bade the sapphire floor be laid,</l>
<l rend="i4">"As tho' with feet divine</l>
<l rend="i4">"To trample azure light,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Like the blue pavement of the firmament.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Here self-suspended hangs in air,</l>
<l rend="i0">"As its pure substance loathed material touch,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The living<ptr target="#FNanchor_13_13"/> carbuncle;</l>
<l rend="i4">"Sun of the lofty dome</l>
<l rend="i0">"Darkness has no dominion o'er its beams;</l>
<l rend="i0">"Intense it glows, an ever-flowing tide</l>
<l rend="i0">"Of glory, like the day-flood in its source.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Impious! the Trees of vegetable gold,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Such as in Eden's groves</l>
<l rend="i4">"Yet innocent it<ptr target="#FNanchor_14_14"/> grew,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Impious! he made his boast, tho' heaven had hidden</l>
<l rend="i4">"So deep the baneful ore,</l>
<l rend="i2">"That they should branch and bud for him,</l>
<l rend="i0">"That art should force their blossoms and their fruit,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And re-create for him,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Whate'er was lost in Paradise.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Therefore at Shedad's voice</l>
<l rend="i0">"Here towered the palm, a silver trunk,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The fine gold net-work<ptr target="#FNanchor_15_15"/> growing out</l>
<l rend="i4">"Loose from its rugged boughs.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Tall as the Cedar of the mountain, here</l>
<l rend="i0">"Rose the gold branches, hung with emerald leaves,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Blossomed with pearls, and rich with ruby fruit,</l>
<l rend="i0">"O Ad! my country! evil was the day</l>
<l rend="i4">"That thy unhappy sons</l>
<l rend="i4">"Crouched at this Nimrod's throne,<ptr target="#FNanchor_16_16"/></l>
<l rend="i0">"And placed him on the pedestal of power,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And laid their liberties beneath his feet,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Robbing their children of the heritance</l>
<l rend="i4">"Their fathers handed down.</l>
<l rend="i2">"What was to him the squandered wealth?</l>
<l rend="i0">"What was to him the burthen of the land,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The lavished misery?</l>
<l rend="i4">"He did but speak his will,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And like the blasting Siroc of the East,</l>
<l rend="i2">"The ruin of the royal voice</l>
<l rend="i4">"Found its way every-where.</l>
<l rend="i2">"I marvel not that he, whose power</l>
<l rend="i0">"No earthly law, no human feeling curbed,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Mocked at the living God!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"And now the King's command went forth</l>
<l rend="i0">"Among the people, bidding old and young,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Husband and wife, the master and the slave,</l>
<l rend="i0">"All the collected multitudes of Ad,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Here to repair, and hold high festival,</l>
<l rend="i0">"That he might see his people, they behold</l>
<l rend="i2">"Their King's magnificence and power.</l>
<l rend="i2">"The day of festival arrived,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Hither they came, the old man and the boy,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Husband and wife, the master and the slave,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Hither they came. From yonder high tower top,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The loftiest of the Palace, Shedad looked</l>
<l rend="i0">"Down on his tribe: their tents on yonder sands</l>
<l rend="i0">"Rose like the countless billows of the sea.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Their tread and voices like the ocean roar,</l>
<l rend="i0">"One deep confusion of tumultuous sounds.</l>
<l rend="i0">"They saw their King's magnificence; beheld</l>
<l rend="i0">"His Palace sparkling like the Angel domes</l>
<l rend="i0">"Of Paradise; his garden like the bowers</l>
<l rend="i0">"Of early Eden, and they shouted out</l>
<l rend="i0">"Great is the King, a God upon the earth!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"Intoxicate with joy and pride</l>
<l rend="i4">"He heard their blasphemies,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And in his wantonness of heart he bade</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Prophet Houd be brought,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And o'er the marble courts,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And o'er the gorgeous rooms</l>
<l rend="i4">"Glittering with gems and gold,</l>
<l rend="i4">"He led the Man of God.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Is not this a stately pile?"</l>
<l rend="i2">"Cried the Monarch in his joy.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Hath ever eye beheld,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Hath ever thought conceived,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Place more magnificent?</l>
<l rend="i2">"Houd, they saw that Heaven imparted</l>
<l rend="i2">"To thy lips the words of wisdom!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Look at the riches round</l>
<l rend="i4">"And value them aright,</l>
<l rend="i4">"If so thy wisdom can."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"The Prophet heard his vaunt</l>
<l rend="i2">"And answered with an aweful smile,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Costly thy palace King!</l>
<l rend="i2">"But only in the hour<ptr target="#FNanchor_17_17"/> of death</l>
<l rend="i0">"Man learns to value things like these aright.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"Hast thou a fault to find</l>
<l rend="i4">"In all thine eyes have seen?</l>
<l rend="i4">"Again the King exclaimed.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Yes!" said the man of God;</l>
<l rend="i0">"The walls are weak, the building ill secured.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Azrael can enter in!</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Sarsar can pierce thro',</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Icy Wind of Death.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"I was beside the Monarch when he spake....</l>
<l rend="i4">"Gentle the Prophet spake,</l>
<l rend="i4">"But in his eye there dwelt</l>
<l rend="i0">"A sorrow that disturbed me while I gazed,</l>
<l rend="i2">"The countenance of Shedad fell,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And anger sate upon his paler lips.</l>
<l rend="i0">"He to the high tower top the Prophet led,</l>
<l rend="i2">"And pointed to the multitude,</l>
<l rend="i2">"And as again they shouted out</l>
<l rend="i0">"Great is the King! a God upon the Earth!"</l>
<l rend="i2">"Turned with a threatful smile to Houd,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Say they aright, O Prophet? is the King</l>
<l rend="i0">"Great upon earth, a God among mankind?"</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Prophet answered not,</l>
<l rend="i0">"His eye rolled round the infinite multitude,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And into tears he burst.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"Sudden an uproar rose,</l>
<l rend="i4">"A cry of joy below,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Messenger is come!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Kail from Mecca comes,</l>
<l rend="i4">"He brings the boon obtained!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Forth as we went we saw where overhead</l>
<l rend="i4">"There hung a deep black cloud,</l>
<l rend="i4">"On which the multitude</l>
<l rend="i4">"With joyful eyes looked up</l>
<l rend="i4">"And blest the coming rain.</l>
<l rend="i2">"The Messenger addrest the King</l>
<l rend="i4">"And told his tale of joy.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"To Mecca I repaired,</l>
<l rend="i4">"By the Red Hillock knelt</l>
<l rend="i4">"And called on God for rain.</l>
<l rend="i2">"My prayer ascended and was heard;</l>
<l rend="i4">"Three clouds appeared in heaven.</l>
<l rend="i0">"One white, and like the flying cloud of noon,</l>
<l rend="i0">"One red as it had drunk the evening beams,</l>
<l rend="i0">"One black and heavy with its load of rain.</l>
<l rend="i4">"A voice went forth from heaven</l>
<l rend="i4">"Chuse Kail of the three!"</l>
<l rend="i4">"I thanked the gracious Power,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And chose the black cloud, heavy with its wealth."</l>
<l rend="i2">"Right! right! a thousand tongues exclaimed,</l>
<l rend="i2">"And all was merriment and joy.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Then stood the Prophet up and cried aloud,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Woe, woe, to Irem! woe to Ad!</l>
<l rend="i0">"<hi rend="smallcap">Death</hi> is gone up into her palaces!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Woe! woe! a day of guilt and punishment,</l>
<l rend="i0">"A day of desolation!"</l>
<l rend="i8">"As he spake</l>
<l rend="i0">"His large eye rolled in horror, and so deep</l>
<l rend="i0">"His tone, it seemed some Spirit from within</l>
<l rend="i0">"Breathed thro' his moveless lips<ptr target="#FNanchor_18_18"/> the unearthly voice.</l>
<l rend="i0">"All looks were turned to him. "O Ad!" he cried,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Dear native land, by all rememberances</l>
<l rend="i0">"Of childhood, by all joys of manhood dear;</l>
<l rend="i0">"O Vale of many Waters! morn and night</l>
<l rend="i0">"My age must groan for you, and to the grave</l>
<l rend="i0">"Go down in sorrow. Thou wilt give thy fruits,</l>
<l rend="i0">"But who shall gather them? thy grapes will ripen,</l>
<l rend="i0">"But who shall tread the wine-press? Fly the wrath,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Ye who would live and save your souls alive!</l>
<l rend="i0">"For strong is his right hand that bends the Bow,</l>
<l rend="i2">"The Arrows that he shoots are sharp,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And err not from their aim!"<ptr target="#FNanchor_19_19"/></l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"With that, a faithful few</l>
<l rend="i0">"Prest thro' the throng to join him. Then arose</l>
<l rend="i0">"Mockery and mirth; "go bald head!" and they mixed</l>
<l rend="i0">"Curses with laughter. He set forth, yet once</l>
<l rend="i0">"Looked back,—his eye fell on me, and he called</l>
<l rend="i0">"Aswad!"... it startled me,... it terrified,...</l>
<l rend="i0">"Aswad!" again he called,... and I almost</l>
<l rend="i0">"Had followed him. O moment fled too soon!</l>
<l rend="i0">"O moment irrecoverably lost!</l>
<l rend="i0">"The shouts of mockery made a coward of me;</l>
<l rend="i0">"He went, and I remained, in fear of <hi rend="smallcap">Man</hi>!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"He went, and darker grew</l>
<l rend="i4">"The deepening cloud above.</l>
<l rend="i0">"At length it opened, and.... O God! O God!</l>
<l rend="i4">"There were no waters there!</l>
<l rend="i4">"There fell no kindly rain!</l>
<l rend="i2">"The Sarsar from its womb went forth,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Icy Wind of Death."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"They fell around me, thousands fell around,</l>
<l rend="i2">"The King and all his People fell.</l>
<l rend="i4">"All! all! they perished all!</l>
<l rend="i4">"I ... only I ... was left.</l>
<l rend="i2">"There came a Voice to me and said,</l>
<l rend="i2">"In the Day of Visitation,</l>
<l rend="i2">"In the fearful Hour of Judgement,</l>
<l rend="i4">"God hath remembered thee."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"When from an agony of prayer I rose</l>
<l rend="i4">"And from the scene of death</l>
<l rend="i4">"Attempted to go forth,</l>
<l rend="i2">"The way was open, I beheld</l>
<l rend="i4">"No barrier to my steps.</l>
<l rend="i2">"But round these bowers the Arm of God</l>
<l rend="i4">"Had drawn a mighty chain,</l>
<l rend="i0">"A barrier that no human force might break.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Twice I essayed to pass.</l>
<l rend="i4">"With that the voice was heard,</l>
<l rend="i0">"O Aswad be content, and bless the Lord!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"One righteous deed hath saved</l>
<l rend="i4">"Thy soul from utter death.</l>
<l rend="i4">"O Aswad, sinful man!</l>
<l rend="i4">"When by long penitence</l>
<l rend="i4">"Thou feelest thy soul prepared,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Breathe up the wish to die,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And Azrael comes, obedient to the prayer."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"A miserable man</l>
<l rend="i4">"From Earth and Heaven shut out,</l>
<l rend="i4">"I heard the dreadful voice.</l>
<l rend="i2">"I looked around my prison place,</l>
<l rend="i2">"The bodies of the dead were there,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Where'er I looked they lay.</l>
<l rend="i4">"They mouldered, mouldered here,...</l>
<l rend="i0">"Their very bones have crumbled into dust,</l>
<l rend="i4">"So many years have past!</l>
<l rend="i0">"So many weary ages have gone by!</l>
<l rend="i4">"And still I linger here!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Still groaning with the burthen of my sins</l>
<l rend="i4">"Have never dared to breathe</l>
<l rend="i4">"The prayer to be released."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Oh! who can tell the unspeakable misery</l>
<l rend="i4">"Of solitude like this!</l>
<l rend="i2">"No sound hath ever reached my ear</l>
<l rend="i4">"Save of the passing wind....</l>
<l rend="i2">"The fountain's everlasting flow;</l>
<l rend="i4">"The forest in the gale,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The pattering of the shower,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Sounds dead and mournful all.</l>
<l rend="i2">"No bird hath ever closed her wing</l>
<l rend="i2">"Upon these solitary bowers,</l>
<l rend="i0">"No insect sweetly buzzed amid these groves,</l>
<l rend="i4">"From all things that have life,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Save only me, concealed.</l>
<l rend="i2">"This Tree alone that o'er my head</l>
<l rend="i2">"Hangs, down its hospitable boughs,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And bends its whispering leaves</l>
<l rend="i4">"As tho' to welcome me,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Seems to partake<ptr target="#FNanchor_20_20"/> of life;</l>
<l rend="i0">"I love it as my friend, my only friend!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"I know not for what ages I have dragged</l>
<l rend="i4">"This miserable life,</l>
<l rend="i4">"How often I have seen</l>
<l rend="i4">"These antient trees renewed,</l>
<l rend="i0">"What countless generations of mankind</l>
<l rend="i4">"Have risen and fallen asleep,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And I remain the same!</l>
<l rend="i2">"My garment hath not waxed old,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Nor the sole of my shoe hath worn.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"I dare not breathe the prayer to die,</l>
<l rend="i4">"O merciful Lord God!...</l>
<l rend="i4">"But when it is thy will,</l>
<l rend="i4">"But when I have atoned</l>
<l rend="i4">"For mine iniquities,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And sufferings have made pure</l>
<l rend="i4">"My soul with sin defiled,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Release me in thine own good time,...</l>
<l rend="i0">"I will not cease to praise thee, O my God!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Silence ensued awhile,</l>
<l rend="i4">Then Zeinab answered him.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Blessed art thou, O Aswad! for the Lord</l>
<l rend="i4">"Who saved thy soul from Hell,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Will call thee to him in his own good time.</l>
<l rend="i4">"And would that when my heart</l>
<l rend="i4">"Breathed up the wish to die,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Azrael might visit me!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Then would I follow where my babes are gone,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And join Hodeirah now!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">She ceased, and the rushing of wings</l>
<l rend="i2">Was heard in the stillness of night,</l>
<l rend="i0">And Azrael, the Death-Angel stood before them.</l>
<l rend="i4">His countenance was dark,</l>
<l rend="i4">Solemn, but not severe,</l>
<l rend="i0">It awed but struck no terror to the heart.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Zeinab, thy wish is heard!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Aswad, thy hour is come!"</l>
<l rend="i0">They fell upon the ground and blest the voice,</l>
<l rend="i4">And Azrael from his sword</l>
<l rend="i0">Let drop<ptr target="#FNanchor_21_21"/> the drops of bitterness and death.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Me too! me too!" young Thalaba exclaimed:</l>
<l rend="i4">As wild with grief he kissed</l>
<l rend="i4">His Mother's livid hand,</l>
<l rend="i4">His Mother's quivering lips,</l>
<l rend="i4">"O Angel! take me too!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Son of Hodeirah!" the Death-Angel cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"It is not yet the hour.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Son of Hodeirah, thou art chosen forth</l>
<l rend="i4">"To do the will of Heaven;</l>
<l rend="i4">"To avenge thy Father's death,</l>

<l rend="i2">"Live! and remember Destiny</l>
<l rend="i4">"Hath marked thee from mankind!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">He ceased, and he was gone.</l>
<l rend="i4">Young Thalaba looked round,...</l>
<l rend="i0">The Palace and the groves were seen no more,</l>
<l rend="i0">He stood amid the Wilderness, alone.</l>

<l rend="i0">That in the Dens of Darkness burnt for thee,</l>
<l rend="i4">Burns yet, and yet shall burn.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">In the Domdaniel caverns</l>
<l rend="i2">Under the Roots of the Ocean,</l>
<l rend="i4">Met the Masters of the Spell.</l>
<l rend="i4">Before them in the vault,</l>
<l rend="i0">Blazing unfuelled from the floor of rock,</l>
<l rend="i4">Ten magic flames arose.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Burn mystic fires!" Abdaldar cried,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Burn whilst Hodeirah's dreaded race exist.</l>
<l rend="i4">"This is the appointed hour,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The hour that shall secure these dens of night."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"Dim they burn," exclaimed Lobaba,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Dim they burn, and now they waver!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Okba lifts the arm of death,</l>
<l rend="i4">"They waver,... they go out!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"Curse on his hasty hand!"</l>
<l rend="i4">Khawla exclaimed in wrath,</l>
<l rend="i4">The woman-fiend exclaimed,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Curse on his hasty hand, the fool hath failed!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Eight only are gone out."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">A Teraph<ptr target="#FNanchor_22_22"/> stood against the cavern side,</l>
<l rend="i4">A new-born infant's head,</l>
<l rend="i0">That Khawla at his hour of birth had seized</l>
<l rend="i4">And from the shoulders wrung.</l>
<l rend="i2">It stood upon a plate of gold,</l>
<l rend="i0">An unclean Spirit's name inscribed beneath.</l>
<l rend="i4">The cheeks were deathy dark,</l>
<l rend="i0">Dark the dead skin upon the hairless skull;</l>
<l rend="i4">The lips were bluey pale;</l>
<l rend="i4">Only the eyes had life,</l>
<l rend="i4">They gleamed with demon light.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Tell me!" quoth Khawla, "is the Fire gone out</l>
<l rend="i2">"That threats the Masters of the Spell?"</l>
<l rend="i4">The dead lips moved and spake,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Fire still burns that threats</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Masters of the Spell."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"Curse on thee, Okba!" Khawla cried,</l>
<l rend="i2">As to the den the Sorcerer came,</l>
<l rend="i2">He bore the dagger in his hand</l>
<l rend="i0">Hot from the murder of Hodeirah's race.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Behold those unextinguished flames!</l>
<l rend="i4">"The fire still burns that threats</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Masters of the Spell!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Okba, wert thou weak of heart?</l>
<l rend="i4">"Okba, wert thou blind of eye?</l>
<l rend="i2">"Thy fate and ours were on the lot,</l>
<l rend="i2">"And we believed the lying stars</l>
<l rend="i0">"That said thy hand might seize the auspicious hour!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Thou hast let slip the reins of Destiny,...</l>
<l rend="i4">"Curse thee, curse thee, Okba!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The Murderer answering said,</l>
<l rend="i2">"O versed in all enchanted lore,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Thou better knowest Okba's soul.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Eight blows I struck, eight home-driven blows,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Needed no second stroke</l>
<l rend="i4">"From this envenomed blade.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Ye frown at me as if the will had failed,</l>
<l rend="i4">"As if ye did not know</l>
<l rend="i0">"My double danger from Hodeirah's race,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The deeper hate I feel,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The stronger motive that inspired my arm!</l>
<l rend="i2">"Ye frown as if my hasty fault,</l>
<l rend="i4">"My ill-directed blow</l>
<l rend="i4">"Had spared the enemy,</l>
<l rend="i2">"And not the stars that would not give,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And not your feeble spells</l>
<l rend="i4">"That could not force, the sign</l>
<l rend="i4">"Which of the whole was he!</l>
<l rend="i2">"Did ye not bid me strike them all?</l>
<l rend="i0">"Said ye not root and branch should be destroyed?</l>
<l rend="i2">"I heard Hodeirah's dying groan,</l>
<l rend="i2">"I heard his Children's shriek of death,</l>
<l rend="i2">"And sought to consummate the work,</l>
<l rend="i2">"But o'er the two remaining lives</l>
<l rend="i2">"A cloud unpierceable had risen,</l>
<l rend="i2">"A cloud that mocked my searching eyes.</l>
<l rend="i0">"I would have probed it with the dagger-point,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The dagger was repelled,</l>
<l rend="i4">"A Voice came forth and cried</l>
<l rend="i0">"Son of Perdition, cease! thou canst not change</l>
<l rend="i0">"What in the Book of Destiny is written."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Khawla to the Teraph turned,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Tell me where the Prophet's hand</l>
<l rend="i2">"Hides our destined enemy?"</l>
<l rend="i2">The dead lips spake again,</l>
<l rend="i2">"I view the seas, I view the land,</l>
<l rend="i2">"I search the ocean and the earth!</l>
<l rend="i2">"Not on Ocean is the Boy,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Not on Earth his steps are seen."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"A mightier power than we," Lobaba cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Protects our destined foe!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Look! look! one fire burns dim!</l>
<l rend="i4">"It quivers! it goes out!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">It quivered, it was quenched.</l>
<l rend="i4">One flame alone was left,</l>
<l rend="i0">A pale blue flame that trembled on the earth,</l>
<l rend="i0">A hovering light upon whose shrinking edge</l>
<l rend="i4">The darkness seemed to press.</l>
<l rend="i4">Stronger it grew, and spread</l>
<l rend="i4">Its lucid swell around,</l>
<l rend="i0">Extending now where all the ten had stood,</l>
<l rend="i4">With lustre more than all.</l>
<l rend="i4">At that protentous sight,</l>
<l rend="i2">The children of Evil trembled</l>
<l rend="i4">And Terror smote their souls.</l>
<l rend="i4">Over the den the fire</l>
<l rend="i4">Its fearful splendour cast,</l>
<l rend="i0">The broad base rolling up in wavy streams,</l>
<l rend="i0">Bright as the summer lightning when it spreads</l>
<l rend="i2">Its glory o'er the midnight heaven.</l>
<l rend="i4">The Teraphs eyes were dimmed,</l>
<l rend="i4">That like two twinkling stars</l>
<l rend="i4">Shone in the darkness late.</l>
<l rend="i2">The Sorcerers on each other gazed,</l>
<l rend="i2">And every face all pale with fear,</l>
<l rend="i2">And ghastly in that light was seen</l>
<l rend="i0">Like a dead man's by the sepulchral lamp.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Even Khawla fiercest of the enchanter brood</l>
<l rend="i4">Not without effort drew</l>
<l rend="i4">Her fear suspended breath.</l>
<l rend="i4">Anon a deeper rage</l>
<l rend="i4">Inflamed her reddening eye.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Mighty is thy power, Mohammed!"</l>
<l rend="i2">Loud in blasphemy she cried,</l>
<l rend="i2">"But Eblis<ptr target="#FNanchor_23_23"/> would not stoop to man</l>
<l rend="i0">"When Man fair statured as the stately palm,</l>
<l rend="i4">"From his Creator's hand</l>
<l rend="i4">"Was undefiled and pure.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Thou art mighty, O Son of Abdallah!</l>
<l rend="i2">"But who is he of woman born</l>
<l rend="i0">"That shall vie with the might of Eblis?</l>
<l rend="i0">"That shall rival the Prince of the Morning?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">She said, and raised her skinny hand</l>
<l rend="i2">As in defiance to high Heaven,</l>
<l rend="i2">And stretched her long lean finger forth</l>
<l rend="i2">And spake aloud the words of power.</l>
<l rend="i4">The Spirits heard her call,</l>
<l rend="i4">And lo! before her stands</l>
<l rend="i4">Her Demon Minister.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Spirit!" the Enchantress cried,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Where lives the Boy coeval with whose life</l>
<l rend="i4">"Yon magic fire must burn?"</l>
<l rend="i8">DEMON.</l>
<l rend="i2">Mistress of the mighty Spell,</l>
<l rend="i2">Not on Ocean, not on Earth.</l>
<l rend="i4">Only eyes that view</l>
<l rend="i4">Allah's glory throne,</l>
<l rend="i4">See his hiding-place.</l>
<l rend="i0">From some believing Spirit, ask and learn.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"Bring the dead Hodeirah here,"</l>
<l rend="i2">Khawla cried, "and he shall tell."</l>
<l rend="i0">The Demon heard her bidding, and was gone.</l>
<l rend="i2">A moment passed, and at her feet</l>
<l rend="i4">Hodeirah's corpse was laid.</l>
<l rend="i0">His hand still held the sword he grasped in death,</l>
<l rend="i0">The blood not yet had clotted on his wound.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">The Sorceress looked and with a smile</l>
<l rend="i2">That kindled to more fiendishness</l>
<l rend="i4">Her hideous features, cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Where Hodeirah is thy soul?</l>
<l rend="i4">"Is it in the <ptr target="#FNanchor_24_24"/>Zemzem well?</l>
<l rend="i4">"Is it in the Eden groves?</l>
<l rend="i4">"Waits it for the judgement-blast</l>
<l rend="i4">"In the trump of Israfil?</l>
<l rend="i4">"Is it plumed with silver wings</l>
<l rend="i4">"Underneath the throne of God?</l>
<l rend="i4">"Even if beneath his throne</l>
<l rend="i4">"Hodeirah, thou shalt hear,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Thou shalt obey my voice!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">She said, and muttered charms that Hell in fear</l>
<l rend="i4">And Heaven in horror heard.</l>
<l rend="i4">Soon the stiff eye-balls rolled,</l>
<l rend="i0">The muscles with convulsive motion shook,</l>
<l rend="i0">The white lips quivered. Khawla saw, her soul</l>
<l rend="i4">Exulted, and she cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Prophet! behold my power!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Not even death secures</l>
<l rend="i4">"Thy slaves from Khawla's Spell!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Where Hodeirah is thy child?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Hodeirah groaned and closed his eyes,</l>
<l rend="i0">As if in the night and the blindness of death</l>
<l rend="i4">He would have hid himself.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"Speak to my question!" she exclaimed,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Or in that mangled body thou shall live</l>
<l rend="i2">"Ages of torture! answer me!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Where can we find the Boy?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"God! God! Hodeirah cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Release me from this life,</l>
<l rend="i0">"From this intolerable agony!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"Speak!" cried the Sorceress; and she snatched</l>
<l rend="i4">A Viper from the floor,</l>
<l rend="i0">And with the living reptile lashed<ptr target="#FNanchor_25_25"/> his neck.</l>
<l rend="i4">Wreathed, round him with the blow,</l>
<l rend="i2">The Reptile tighter drew her folds</l>
<l rend="i4">And raised her wrathful head,</l>
<l rend="i4">And fixed into his face</l>
<l rend="i4">Her deadly teeth, and shed</l>
<l rend="i4">Poison in every wound.</l>
<l rend="i0">In vain! for Allah heard Hodeirah's prayer,</l>
<l rend="i4">And Khawla on a corpse</l>
<l rend="i4">Had wrecked her baffled rage.</l>
<l rend="i4">The fated fire moved on</l>
<l rend="i0">And round the Body wrapt its funeral flames.</l>
<l rend="i0">The flesh and bones in that portentous pile</l>
<l rend="i4">Consumed; the Sword alone,</l>
<l rend="i4">Circled with fire was left.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Where is the Boy for whose hand it is destined?</l>
<l rend="i0">Where the Destroyer who one day shall wield</l>
<l rend="i2">The Sword that is circled with fire?</l>
<l rend="i4">Race accursed, try your charms!</l>
<l rend="i4">Masters of the mighty Spell,</l>
<l rend="i4">Mutter o'er your words of power!</l>
<l rend="i2">Ye can shatter the dwellings of man,</l>
<l rend="i2">Ye can open the womb of the rock,</l>
<l rend="i2">Ye can shake the foundations of earth,</l>
<l rend="i4">But not the Word of God:</l>
<l rend="i2">But not one letter can ye change</l>
<l rend="i4">Of what his Will hath written!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Who shall seek thro' Araby</l>
<l rend="i4">Hodeirah's dreaded son?</l>
<l rend="i2">They mingle the Arrows<ptr target="#FNanchor_26_26"/> of Chance</l>
<l rend="i2">The lot of Abdaldar is drawn.</l>
<l rend="i2">Thirteen moons must wax and wane</l>
<l rend="i2">Ere the Sorcerer quit his quest.</l>
<l rend="i2">He must visit every tribe</l>
<l rend="i2">That roam the desert wilderness,</l>
<l rend="i2">Or dwell beside perennial streams;</l>
<l rend="i0">Nor leave a solitary tent unsearched</l>
<l rend="i4">Till he has found the Boy,</l>
<l rend="i2">The hated Boy whose blood alone</l>
<l rend="i4">Can quench that dreaded fire.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">A crystal ring Abdaldar bore,</l>
<l rend="i4">The powerful gem<ptr target="#FNanchor_27_27"/> condensed</l>
<l rend="i0">Primeval dews that upon Caucasus</l>
<l rend="i4">Felt the first winter's frost.</l>
<l rend="i4">Ripening there it lay beneath</l>
<l rend="i0">Rock above rock, and mountain ice up-piled</l>
<l rend="i0">On mountain, till the incumbent mass assumed,</l>
<l rend="i0">So huge its bulk, the Ocean's azure hue.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">With this he sought the inner den</l>
<l rend="i4">Where burnt the eternal flame.</l>
<l rend="i0">Like waters gushing from some channelled rock</l>
<l rend="i0">Full thro' a narrow opening, from a chasm</l>
<l rend="i4">The eternal flame streamed up.</l>
<l rend="i4">No eye beheld the fount</l>
<l rend="i4">Of that up-flowing flame,</l>
<l rend="i0">That blazed self-nurtured, and for ever, there.</l>
<l rend="i0">It was no mortal element: the Abyss</l>
<l rend="i0">Supplied it, from the fountains at the first</l>
<l rend="i0">Prepared. In the heart of earth it lives and glows</l>
<l rend="i0">Her vital heat, till at the day decreed,</l>
<l rend="i0">The voice of God shall let its billows loose,</l>
<l rend="i0">To deluge o'er with no abating flood</l>
<l rend="i4">The consummated World;</l>
<l rend="i2">That thenceforth thro' the air must roll,</l>
<l rend="i4">The penal Orb of Fire.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Unturbaned and unsandalled there,</l>
<l rend="i2">Abdaldar stood before the flame,</l>
<l rend="i2">And held the Ring beside, and spake</l>
<l rend="i0">The language that the Elements obey.</l>
<l rend="i0">The obedient flame detatched a portion forth,</l>
<l rend="i0">That, in the crystal entering, was condensed,</l>
<l rend="i0">Gem of the gem, its living Eye of fire.</l>
<l rend="i4">When the hand that wears the spell</l>
<l rend="i4">Shall touch the destined Boy,</l>
<l rend="i4">Then shall that Eye be quenched,</l>
<l rend="i4">And the freed Element</l>
<l rend="i0">Fly to its sacred and remembered Spring.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Now go thy way Abdaldar!</l>
<l rend="i4">Servant of Eblis,</l>
<l rend="i4">Over Arabia</l>
<l rend="i4">Seek the Destroyer!</l>
<l rend="i0">Over the sands of the scorching Tchama,</l>
<l rend="i0">Over the waterless mountains of Naïd,</l>
<l rend="i0">In Arud pursue him; and Yemen the happy,</l>
<l rend="i0">And Hejaz, the country beloved by believers.</l>
<l rend="i4">Over Arabia</l>
<l rend="i4">Servant of Eblis,</l>
<l rend="i4">Seek the Destroyer.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">From tribe to tribe, from town to town,</l>
<l rend="i2">From tent to tent, Abdaldar past.</l>
<l rend="i0">Him every morn the all-beholding Eye</l>
<l rend="i0">Saw from his couch, unhallowed by a prayer,</l>
<l rend="i4">Rise to the scent of blood,</l>
<l rend="i4">And every night lie down.</l>
<l rend="i0">That rankling hope within him, that by day</l>
<l rend="i0">Goaded his steps, still stinging him in sleep,</l>
<l rend="i0">And startling him with vain accomplishment</l>
<l rend="i4">From visions still the same.</l>
<l rend="i4">Many a time his wary hand</l>
<l rend="i2">To many a youth applied the Ring,</l>
<l rend="i0">And still the dagger in his mantle hid</l>
<l rend="i4">Was ready for the deed.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">At length to the cords of a tent</l>
<l rend="i2">That were stretched by an Island of Palms</l>
<l rend="i2">In the desolate sea of the sands,</l>
<l rend="i4">The weary traveller came.</l>
<l rend="i4">Under a shapely palm,</l>
<l rend="i0">Herself as shapely, there a Damsel stood.</l>
<l rend="i4">She held her ready robe</l>
<l rend="i4">And looked towards a Boy,</l>
<l rend="i4">Who from the tree above</l>
<l rend="i2">With one hand clinging to its trunk,</l>
<l rend="i0">Cast with the other down the clustered dates.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The Wizard approached the Tree,</l>
<l rend="i0">He leaned on his staff, like a way-faring man,</l>
<l rend="i0">And the sweat of his travel was seen on his brow.</l>
<l rend="i4">He asks for food, and lo!</l>
<l rend="i0">The Damsel proffers him her lap of dates.</l>
<l rend="i0">And the Stripling descends, and runs into the tent</l>
<l rend="i0">And brings him forth water, the draught of delight.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Anon the Master of the tent,</l>
<l rend="i2">The Father of the family</l>
<l rend="i0">Came forth, a man in years, of aspect mild.</l>
<l rend="i2">To the stranger approaching he gave</l>
<l rend="i2">The friendly saluting of peace,</l>
<l rend="i4">And bade the skin be spread.</l>
<l rend="i2">Before the tent they spread the<ptr target="#FNanchor_28_28"/> skin,</l>
<l rend="i4">Under a Tamarind's shade,</l>
<l rend="i4">That bending forward, stretched</l>
<l rend="i4">Its boughs of beauty far.</l>
<l rend="i4">They brought the Traveller rice,</l>
<l rend="i0">With no false colours<ptr target="#FNanchor_29_29"/> tinged to tempt the eye,</l>
<l rend="i2">But white as the new-fallen snow,</l>
<l rend="i2">When never yet the sullying Sun</l>
<l rend="i4">Hath seen its purity,</l>
<l rend="i0">Nor the warm Zephyr touched and tainted it.</l>
<l rend="i2">The dates of the grove before their guest</l>
<l rend="i2">They laid, and the luscious fig,</l>
<l rend="i4">And water from the well.</l>
<l rend="i2">The Damsel from the Tamarind tree</l>
<l rend="i4">Had plucked its acid fruit</l>
<l rend="i4">And steeped it in water long;</l>
<l rend="i2">And whoso drank of the cooling<ptr target="#FNanchor_30_30"/> draught</l>
<l rend="i4">He would not wish for wine.</l>
<l rend="i2">This to the guest the Damsel brought,</l>
<l rend="i2">And a modest pleasure kindled her cheek,</l>
<l rend="i0">When raising from the cup his moistened lips</l>
<l rend="i0">The Stranger smiled, and praised, and drank again.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Whither is gone the Boy?</l>
<l rend="i2">He had pierced the Melon's pulp</l>
<l rend="i4">And closed with wax the wound,</l>
<l rend="i2">And he had duly gone at morn</l>
<l rend="i4">And watched its ripening rind,</l>
<l rend="i2">And now all joyfully he brings</l>
<l rend="i4">The treasure now matured.</l>
<l rend="i0">His dark eyes sparkle with a boy's delight.</l>
<l rend="i0">As he pours out its liquid<ptr target="#FNanchor_31_31"/> lusciousness</l>
<l rend="i4">And proffers to the guest.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Abdaldar ate, and he was satisfied:</l>
<l rend="i4">And now his tongue discoursed</l>
<l rend="i4">Of regions far remote,</l>
<l rend="i0">As one whose busy feet had travelled long.</l>
<l rend="i2">The Father of the family,</l>
<l rend="i2">With a calm eye and quiet smile,</l>
<l rend="i4">Sate pleased to hearken him.</l>
<l rend="i2">The Damsel who removed the meal,</l>
<l rend="i4">She loitered on the way</l>
<l rend="i4">And listened with full <ptr target="#FNanchor_32_32"/>hands</l>
<l rend="i4">A moment motionless.</l>
<l rend="i4">All eagerly the Boy</l>
<l rend="i4">Watches the Traveller's lips,</l>
<l rend="i4">And still the wily man</l>
<l rend="i0">With seemly kindness to the eager Boy</l>
<l rend="i4">Directs his winning tale.</l>
<l rend="i2">Ah, cursed man! if this be he,</l>
<l rend="i0">If thou hast found the object of thy search,</l>
<l rend="i4">Thy hate, thy bloody aim,</l>
<l rend="i0">Into what deep damnation wilt thou plunge</l>
<l rend="i4">Thy miserable soul!</l>
<l rend="i0">Look! how his eye delighted watches thine!</l>
<l rend="i4">Look! how his open lips</l>
<l rend="i4">Gasp at the winning tale!</l>
<l rend="i4">And nearer now he comes</l>
<l rend="i0">To lose no word of that delightful talk.</l>
<l rend="i4">Then, as in familiar mood,</l>
<l rend="i4">Upon the Stripling's arm</l>
<l rend="i4">The Sorcerer laid his hand,</l>
<l rend="i2">And the fire of the Crystal fled.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Whilst the sudden shoot of joy</l>
<l rend="i4">Made pale Abdaldar's cheek,</l>
<l rend="i4">The Master's voice was heard:</l>
<l rend="i4">"It is the hour<ptr target="#FNanchor_33_33"/> of prayer,...</l>
<l rend="i0">"My children, let us purify ourselves</l>
<l rend="i4">"And praise the Lord our God!"</l>
<l rend="i4">The Boy the water brought,</l>
<l rend="i0">After the law<ptr target="#FNanchor_34_34"/> they purified themselves,</l>
<l rend="i0">And bent their faces to the earth in prayer.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">All, save Abdaldar; over Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i0">He stands, and lifts the dagger to destroy.</l>
<l rend="i2">Before his lifted arm received</l>
<l rend="i4">Its impulse to descend,</l>
<l rend="i4">The Blast of the Desert came.</l>
<l rend="i0">Prostrate in prayer, the pious family</l>
<l rend="i4">Felt not the Simoom<ptr target="#FNanchor_35_35"/> pass.</l>
<l rend="i0">They rose, and lo! the Sorcerer lying dead,</l>
<l rend="i0">Holding the dagger in his blasted hand.</l></lg>

</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i6">But see,... the sparkling stone!</l>
<l rend="i0">How it has caught the glory of the Sun,</l>
<l rend="i0">And streams it back again in lines of light!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">ONEIZA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Why do you take it from him Thalaba?...</l>
<l rend="i0">And look at it so near?... it may have charms</l>
<l rend="i0">To blind, or poison ... throw it in the grave!...</l>
<l rend="i0">I would not touch it!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">And around its rim</l>
<l rend="i0">Strange letters,...</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">ONEIZA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">Bury it.... Oh! bury it!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">It is not written as the Koran is;</l>
<l rend="i0">Some other tongue perchance ... the accursed man</l>
<l rend="i0">Said he had been a traveller.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">MOATH.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i6"><hi rend="italic">coming from the tent.</hi></l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i10">Thalaba,</l><l rend="i0">What hast thou there?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">A ring the dead man wore,</l>
<l rend="i0">Perhaps my father, you can read its meaning.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">MOATH.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">No Boy,... the letters are not such as ours.</l>
<l rend="i0">Heap the sand over it! a wicked man</l>
<l rend="i0">Wears nothing holy.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">Nay! not bury it!</l>
<l rend="i0">It may be that some traveller who shall enter</l>
<l rend="i0">Our tent, may read them: or if we approach</l>
<l rend="i0">Cities where strangers dwell and learned men,</l>
<l rend="i0">They may interpret.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">MOATH.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">It were better hid</l>
<l rend="i0">Under the desert sands. This wretched man,</l>
<l rend="i0">Whom God hath smitten in the very purpose</l>
<l rend="i0">And impulse of his unpermitted crime,</l>
<l rend="i0">Belike was some Magician, and these lines</l>
<l rend="i0">Are of the language that the Demons use.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">ONEIZA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Bury it! bury it ... dear Thalaba!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">MOATH.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Such cursed men there are upon the earth,</l>
<l rend="i0">In league and treaty with the Evil powers,</l>
<l rend="i0">The covenanted enemies of God</l>
<l rend="i0">And of all good, dear purchase have they made</l>
<l rend="i0">Of rule, and riches, and their life-long sway,</l>
<l rend="i0">Masters, yet slaves of Hell. Beneath the Roots</l>
<l rend="i0">Of Ocean, the Domdaniel caverns lie:</l>
<l rend="i0">Their impious meeting; there they learn the words</l>
<l rend="i0">Unutterable by man who holds his hope</l>
<l rend="i0">Of Heaven, there brood the Pestilence, and let</l>
<l rend="i0">The Earthquake loose.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i6">  And he who would have killed me</l>
<l rend="i0">Was one of these?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">MOATH.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i6">I know not, but it may be</l>
<l rend="i0">That on the Table of Destiny, thy name</l>
<l rend="i0">Is written their Destroyer, and for this</l>
<l rend="i0">Thy life by yonder miserable man</l>
<l rend="i0">So sought; so saved by interfering Heaven.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">His ring has some strange power then?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">MOATH.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i13">Every gem,<ptr target="#FNanchor_36_36"/></l><l rend="i0">So sages say, has virtue; but the science</l>
<l rend="i0">Of difficult attainment, some grow pale</l>
<l rend="i0">Conscious of poison,<ptr target="#FNanchor_37_37"/> or with sudden shade</l>
<l rend="i0">Of darkness, warn the wearer; same preserve</l>
<l rend="i0">From spells, or blunt the hostile weapon's<ptr target="#FNanchor_38_38"/> edge.</l>
<l rend="i0">Some open rocks and mountains, and lay bare</l>
<l rend="i0">Their buried treasures; others make the sight</l>
<l rend="i0">Strong to perceive the presence of all Beings</l>
<l rend="i0">Thro' whose pure substance the unaided eye</l>
<l rend="i0">Passes, like empty air ... and in yon stone</l>
<l rend="i0">I deem some such misterious quality.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">My father, I will wear it.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">MOATH.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i10">Thalaba!</l></lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">In God's name, and the Prophet's! be its power</l>
<l rend="i0">Good, let it serve the righteous: if for evil,</l>
<l rend="i0">God and my trust in him shall hallow it.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">So Thalaba drew on</l>
<l rend="i4">The written ring of gold.</l>
<l rend="i4">Then in the hollow grave</l>
<l rend="i4">They laid Abdaldar's corpse,</l>
<l rend="i0">And levelled over him the desert dust.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">The Sun arose, ascending from beneath</l>
<l rend="i4">The horizon's circling line.</l>
<l rend="i0">As Thalaba to his ablutions went,</l>
<l rend="i0">Lo! the grave open, and the corpse exposed!</l>
<l rend="i2">It was not that the winds of night</l>
<l rend="i0">Had swept away the sands that covered it,</l>
<l rend="i2">For heavy with the undried dew</l>
<l rend="i0">The desert dust was dark and close around;</l>
<l rend="i0">And the night air had been so moveless calm,</l>
<l rend="i4">It had not from the grove</l>
<l rend="i4">Shaken a ripe date down.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Amazed to hear the tale</l>
<l rend="i0">Forth from the tent came Moath and his child.</l>
<l rend="i0">Awhile the thoughtful man surveyed the corpse</l>
<l rend="i4">Silent with downward eyes,</l>
<l rend="i0">Then turning spake to Thalaba and said,</l>
<l rend="i0">"I have heard that there are places by the abode</l>
<l rend="i0">"Of holy men, so holily possessed,</l>
<l rend="i0">"That if a corpse be buried there, the ground</l>
<l rend="i0">"With a convulsive effort shakes it out,<ptr target="#FNanchor_39_39"/></l>
<l rend="i0">"Impatient of pollution. Have the feet</l>
<l rend="i0">"Of Prophet or Apostle blest this place?</l>
<l rend="i0">"Ishmael, or Houd, or Saleh, or than all,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Mohammed, holier name? or is the man</l>
<l rend="i0">"So foul with magic and all blasphemy,</l>
<l rend="i0">"That Earth<ptr target="#FNanchor_40_40"/> like Heaven rejects him? it is best</l>
<l rend="i0">"Forsake the station. Let us strike our tent.</l>
<l rend="i2">"The place is tainted ... and behold</l>
<l rend="i0">"The Vulture<ptr target="#FNanchor_41_41"/> hovers yonder, and his scream</l>
<l rend="i0">"Chides us that we still we scare him from his banquet.</l>
<l rend="i4">"So let the accursed one</l>
<l rend="i4">"Find fitting sepulchre."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Then from the pollution of death</l>
<l rend="i2">With water they made themselves pure,</l>
<l rend="i4">And Thalaba drew up</l>
<l rend="i4">The fastening of the cords,</l>
<l rend="i4">And Moath furled the tent,</l>
<l rend="i0">And from the grove of palms Oneiza led</l>
<l rend="i0">The Camels, ready to receive their load.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The dews had ceased to steam</l>
<l rend="i4">Towards the climbing Sun,</l>
<l rend="i0">When from the Isle of Palms they went their way.</l>
<l rend="i0">And when the Sun had reached his southern height,</l>
<l rend="i4">As back they turned their eyes,</l>
<l rend="i4">The distant Palms arose</l>
<l rend="i0">Like to the top-sails of some far-off fleet</l>
<l rend="i4">Distinctly seen, where else</l>
<l rend="i0">The Ocean bounds had blended with the sky.</l>
<l rend="i4">And when the eve came on</l>
<l rend="i0">The sight returning reached the grove no more.</l>
<l rend="i2">They planted the pole of their tent,</l>
<l rend="i2">And they laid them down to repose.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">At midnight Thalaba started up,</l>
<l rend="i0">For he felt that the ring on his finger was moved.</l>
<l rend="i4">He called on Allah aloud,</l>
<l rend="i4">And he called on the Prophet's name.</l>
<l rend="i4">Moath arose in alarm,</l>
<l rend="i4">"What ails thee Thalaba?" he cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Is the Robber of night at hand?"</l>
<l rend="i4">"Dost thou not see," the youth exclaimed,</l>
<l rend="i4">"A Spirit in the Tent?"</l>
<l rend="i4">Moath looked round and said,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The moon beam shines in the Tent,</l>
<l rend="i4">"I see thee stand in the light,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And thy shadow is black on the ground."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Thalaba answered not.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Spirit!" he cried, "what brings thee here?</l>
<l rend="i4">"In the name of the Prophet, speak,</l>
<l rend="i4">"In the name of Allah, obey!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">He ceased, and there was silence in the Tent.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Dost thou not hear?" quoth Thalaba.</l>
<l rend="i4">The listening man replied,</l>
<l rend="i4">"I hear the wind, that flaps</l>
<l rend="i4">"The curtain of the Tent.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"The Ring! the Ring!" the youth exclaimed.</l>
<l rend="i2">"For that the Spirit of Evil comes,</l>
<l rend="i2">"By that I see, by that I hear.</l>
<l rend="i2">"In the name of God, I ask thee</l>
<l rend="i2">"Who was he that slew my Father?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">DEMON.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Master of the powerful Ring!</l>
<l rend="i0">Okba, the wise Magician, did the deed.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Where does the Murderer dwell?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">DEMON.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">In the Domdaniel caverns</l>
<l rend="i4">Under the Roots of the Ocean.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Why were my Father and my brethren slain?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">DEMON.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">We knew from the race of Hodeirah</l>
<l rend="i2">The destined destroyer would come.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Bring me my father's sword.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">DEMON.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">A fire surrounds the fated-sword,</l>
<l rend="i2">No Spirit or Magician's hand</l>
<l rend="i2">Can pierce that guardian flame.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Bring me his bow and his arrows.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Distinctly Moath heard his voice, and She</l>
<l rend="i0">Who thro' the Veil of Separation, watched</l>
<l rend="i0">All sounds in listening terror, whose suspense</l>
<l rend="i4">Forbade the aid of prayer.</l>
<l rend="i2">They heard the voice of Thalaba;</l>
<l rend="i0">But when the Spirit spake, the motionless air</l>
<l rend="i4">Felt not the subtle sounds,</l>
<l rend="i4">Too fine for mortal sense.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">On a sudden the rattle of arrows was heard,</l>
<l rend="i0">And the quiver was laid at the feet of the youth,</l>
<l rend="i0">And in his hand they saw Hodeirah's Bow.</l>
<l rend="i2">He eyed the Bow, he twanged the string,</l>
<l rend="i0">And his heart bounded to the joyous tone.</l>
<l rend="i2">Anon he raised his voice, and cried</l>
<l rend="i4">"Go thy way, and never more,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Evil Spirit, haunt our tent!</l>
<l rend="i4">"By the virtue of the Ring,</l>
<l rend="i4">"By Mohammed's holier might,</l>
<l rend="i4">"By the holiest name of God,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Thee and all the Powers of Hell</l>
<l rend="i4">"I adjure and I command</l>
<l rend="i4">"Never more to trouble us!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Nor ever from that hour</l>
<l rend="i0">Did rebel Spirit on the Tent intrude,</l>
<l rend="i4">Such virtue had the Spell.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">And peacefully the vernal years</l>
<l rend="i4">Of Thalaba past on.</l>
<l rend="i0">Till now without an effort he could bend</l>
<l rend="i4">Hodeirah's stubborn Bow.</l>
<l rend="i4">Black were his eyes and bright,</l>
<l rend="i4">The sunny hue of health</l>
<l rend="i4">Glowed on his tawny cheek,</l>
<l rend="i0">His lip was darkened by maturing life;</l>
<l rend="i0">Strong were his shapely limbs, his stature tall;</l>
<l rend="i4">He was a comely youth.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Compassion for the child</l>
<l rend="i0">Had first old Moath's kindly heart possessed,</l>
<l rend="i0">An orphan, wailing in the wilderness.</l>
<l rend="i0">But when he heard his tale, his wonderous tale,</l>
<l rend="i0">Told by the Boy with such eye-speaking truth,</l>
<l rend="i2">Now with sudden bursts of anger,</l>
<l rend="i2">Now in the agony of tears,</l>
<l rend="i0">And now in flashes of prophetic joy.</l>
<l rend="i0">What had been pity became reverence,</l>
<l rend="i2">And like a sacred trust from Heaven</l>
<l rend="i4">The old man cherished him.</l>
<l rend="i4">Now with a father's love,</l>
<l rend="i2">Child of his choice, he loved the Boy,</l>
<l rend="i0">And like a father to the Boy was dear.</l>
<l rend="i0">Oneiza called him brother, and the youth,</l>
<l rend="i0">More fondly than a brother, loved the maid,</l>
<l rend="i0">The loveliest of Arabian maidens she.</l>
<l rend="i4">How happily the years</l>
<l rend="i4">Of Thalaba went by!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">It was the wisdom and the will of Heaven</l>
<l rend="i2">That in a lonely tent had cast</l>
<l rend="i4">The lot of Thalaba.</l>
<l rend="i2">There might his soul develope best</l>
<l rend="i4">Its strengthening energies;</l>
<l rend="i4">There might he from the world</l>
<l rend="i0">Keep his heart pure and uncontaminate,</l>
<l rend="i0">Till at the written hour he should be found</l>
<l rend="i0">Fit servant of the Lord, without a spot.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Years of his youth, how rapidly ye fled</l>
<l rend="i2">In that beloved solitude!</l>
<l rend="i0">Is the morn fair, and does the freshening breeze</l>
<l rend="i2">Flow with cool current o'er his cheek?</l>
<l rend="i0">Lo! underneath the broad-leaved sycamore</l>
<l rend="i4">With lids half closed he lies,</l>
<l rend="i4">Dreaming of days to come.</l>
<l rend="i0">His dog<ptr target="#FNanchor_42_42"/> beside him, in mute blandishment,</l>
<l rend="i4">Now licks his listless hand,</l>
<l rend="i0">Now lifts an anxious and expectant eye</l>
<l rend="i4">Courting the wonted caress.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Or comes the Father<ptr target="#FNanchor_43_43"/> of the Rains</l>
<l rend="i2">From his Caves in the uttermost West,</l>
<l rend="i4">Comes he in darkness and storms?</l>
<l rend="i6">When the blast is loud,</l>
<l rend="i6">When the waters fill</l>
<l rend="i4">The Travellers tread in the sands,</l>
<l rend="i6">When the pouring shower</l>
<l rend="i6">Streams adown the roof,</l>
<l rend="i0">When the door-curtain hangs in heavier folds,</l>
<l rend="i2">When the outstrained tent flags loosely,</l>
<l rend="i6">Comfort is within,</l>
<l rend="i4">The embers chearful glow,</l>
<l rend="i2">The sound of the familiar voice,</l>
<l rend="i4">The song that lightens toil.</l>
<l rend="i0">Under the common shelter on dry sand</l>
<l rend="i0">The quiet Camels ruminate their food;</l>
<l rend="i2">From Moath falls the lengthening cord,</l>
<l rend="i4">As patiently the old Man</l>
<l rend="i0">Intwines the strong palm-fibers;<ptr target="#FNanchor_44_44"/> by the hearth</l>
<l rend="i2">The Damsel shakes the coffee-grains,</l>
<l rend="i2">That with warm fragrance fill the tent;</l>
<l rend="i0">And while with dextrous fingers, Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i0">Shapes the green basket,<ptr target="#FNanchor_45_45"/> haply at his feet</l>
<l rend="i2">Her favourite kidling gnaws the twig,</l>
<l rend="i0">Forgiven plunderer, for Oneiza's sake!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Or when the winter torrent rolls</l>
<l rend="i0">Down the deep-channelled rain-course, foamingly,</l>
<l rend="i4">Dark with its mountain spoils,</l>
<l rend="i2">With bare feet pressing the wet sand</l>
<l rend="i4">There wanders Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i2">The rushing flow, the flowing roar,</l>
<l rend="i2">Filling his yielded faculties;</l>
<l rend="i0">A vague, a dizzy, a tumultuous joy.</l>
<l rend="i1">... Or lingers it a vernal brook<ptr target="#FNanchor_46_46"/></l>
<l rend="i4">Gleaming o'er yellow sands?</l>
<l rend="i2">Beneath the lofty bank reclined,</l>
<l rend="i0">With idle eye he views its little waves,</l>
<l rend="i0">Quietly listening to the quiet flow;</l>
<l rend="i0">While in the breathings of the stirring gale</l>
<l rend="i4">The tall canes bend above,</l>
<l rend="i2">Floating like streamers on the wind</l>
<l rend="i4">Their lank uplifted leaves.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Nor rich,<ptr target="#FNanchor_47_47"/> nor poor, was Moath; God had given</l>
<l rend="i0">Enough, and blest him with a mind content.</l>
<l rend="i0">No hoarded<ptr target="#FNanchor_48_48"/> gold disquieted his dreams;</l>
<l rend="i0">But ever round his station he beheld</l>
<l rend="i4">Camels that knew his voice,</l>
<l rend="i0">And home-birds, grouping at Oneiza's call,</l>
<l rend="i4">And goats that, morn and eve,</l>
<l rend="i0">Came with full udders to the Damsel's hand.</l>
<l rend="i0">Dear child! the Tent beneath whose shade they dwelt</l>
<l rend="i2">That was her work; and she had twined</l>
<l rend="i4">His girdle's many-hues;</l>
<l rend="i4">And he had seen his robe</l>
<l rend="i4">Grow in Oneiza's loom.<ptr target="#FNanchor_49_49"/></l>
<l rend="i0">How often with a memory-mingled joy</l>
<l rend="i0">That made her Mother live before his sight,</l>
<l rend="i0">He watched her nimble finders thread the woof!</l>
<l rend="i0">Or at the hand-mill<ptr target="#FNanchor_50_50"/> when she knelt and toiled,</l>
<l rend="i2">Tost the thin cake on spreading palm,</l>
<l rend="i0">Or fixed it on the glowing oven's side</l>
<l rend="i0">With bare<ptr target="#FNanchor_51_51"/> wet arm, in safe dexterity.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">'Tis the cool evening hour:</l>
<l rend="i4">The Tamarind from the dew</l>
<l rend="i4">Sheaths<ptr target="#FNanchor_52_52"/> its young fruit, yet green.</l>
<l rend="i2">Before their Tent the mat is spread,</l>
<l rend="i4">The old man's aweful voice</l>
<l rend="i4">Intones<ptr target="#FNanchor_53_53"/> the holy Book.</l>
<l rend="i0">What if beneath no lamp-illumined dome,</l>
<l rend="i0">Its marble walls<ptr target="#FNanchor_54_54"/> bedecked with flourished truth,</l>
<l rend="i0">Azure and gold adornment? sinks the Word</l>
<l rend="i0">With deeper influence from the Imam's voice,</l>
<l rend="i0">Where in the day of congregation, crowds</l>
<l rend="i4">Perform the duty task?</l>
<l rend="i4">Their Father is their Priest,</l>
<l rend="i2">The Stars of Heaven their point<ptr target="#FNanchor_55_55"/> of prayer,</l>
<l rend="i4">And the blue Firmament</l>
<l rend="i2">The glorious Temple, where they feel</l>
<l rend="i4">The present Deity.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Yet thro' the purple glow of eve</l>
<l rend="i4">Shines dimly the white moon.</l>
<l rend="i0">The slackened bow, the quiver, the long lance,</l>
<l rend="i2">Rest on the pillar<ptr target="#FNanchor_56_56"/> of the Tent.</l>
<l rend="i0">Knitting light palm-leaves<ptr target="#FNanchor_57_57"/> for her brother's brow</l>
<l rend="i4">The dark-eyed damsel sits;</l>
<l rend="i4">The Old Man tranquilly</l>
<l rend="i4">Up his curled pipe inhales</l>
<l rend="i4">The tranquillizing herb.</l>
<l rend="i0">So listen they the reed<ptr target="#FNanchor_58_58"/> of Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i2">While his skilled fingers modulate</l>
<l rend="i0">The low, sweet, soothing, melancholy tones,</l>
<l rend="i0">Or if he strung the pearls<ptr target="#FNanchor_59_59"/> of Poetry</l>
<l rend="i2">Singing with agitated face</l>
<l rend="i0">And eloquent arms, and sobs that reach the heart,</l>
<l rend="i4">A tale<ptr target="#FNanchor_60_60"/> of love and woe;</l>
<l rend="i0">Then, if the brightening Moon that lit his face</l>
<l rend="i4">In darkness favoured her's,</l>
<l rend="i0">Oh! even with such a look, as, fables say,</l>
<l rend="i0">The mother Ostrich<ptr target="#FNanchor_61_61"/> fixes on her egg,</l>
<l rend="i4">Till that intense affection</l>
<l rend="i4">Kindle its light of life,</l>
<l rend="i0">Even in such deep and breathless tenderness</l>
<l rend="i0">Oneiza's soul is centered on the youth,</l>
<l rend="i0">So motionless with such an ardent gaze,</l>
<l rend="i4">Save when from her full eyes</l>
<l rend="i0">Quickly she wipes away the gushing tears</l>
<l rend="i4">That dim his image there.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">She called him brother: was it sister-love</l>
<l rend="i4">That made the silver rings</l>
<l rend="i0">Round her smooth ankles<ptr target="#FNanchor_62_62"/> and her twany arms,</l>
<l rend="i0">Shine daily brightened? for a brother's eye</l>
<l rend="i4">Were her long fingers<ptr target="#FNanchor_63_63"/> tinged,</l>
<l rend="i4">As when she trimmed the lamp,</l>
<l rend="i2">And thro' the veins and delicate skin</l>
<l rend="i0">The light shone rosy? that the darkened lids<ptr target="#FNanchor_64_64"/></l>
<l rend="i0">Gave yet a softer lustre to her eye?</l>
<l rend="i4">That with such pride she tricked</l>
<l rend="i0">Her glossy tresses, and on holy day</l>
<l rend="i0">Wreathed the red flower-crown<ptr target="#FNanchor_65_65"/> round their jetty waves?</l>
<l rend="i4">How happily the years</l>
<l rend="i4">Of Thalaba went by!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Yet was the heart of Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i4">Impatient of repose;</l>
<l rend="i4">Restless he pondered still</l>
<l rend="i4">The task for him decreed,</l>
<l rend="i0">The mighty and mysterious work announced.</l>
<l rend="i2">Day by day with youthful ardour</l>
<l rend="i2">He the call of Heaven awaits,</l>
<l rend="i0">And oft in visions o'er the Murderer's head</l>
<l rend="i4">He lifts the avenging arm,</l>
<l rend="i4">And oft in dreams he sees</l>
<l rend="i2">The Sword that is circled with fire.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">One morn as was their wont, in sportive mood</l>
<l rend="i0">The youth and damsel bent Hodeirah's bow,</l>
<l rend="i0">For with no feeble hand nor erring aim</l>
<l rend="i0">Oneiza could let loose the obedient shaft.</l>
<l rend="i2">With head back-bending, Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i0">Shot up the aimless arrow high in air,</l>
<l rend="i0">Whose line in vain the aching sight pursued</l>
<l rend="i4">Lost in the depth of heaven.</l>
<l rend="i0">"When will the hour arrive," exclaimed the youth,</l>
<l rend="i2">"That I shall aim these fated shafts</l>
<l rend="i4">"To vengeance long delayed?</l>
<l rend="i0">"Have I not strength, my father, for the deed?</l>
<l rend="i2">"Or can the will of Providence</l>
<l rend="i4">"Be mutable like man?</l>
<l rend="i2">"Shall I never be called to the task?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Impatient boy!" quoth Moath, with a smile:</l>
<l rend="i0">"Impatient Thalaba!" Oneiza cried,</l>
<l rend="i2">And she too smiled, but in her smile</l>
<l rend="i0">A mild reproachful melancholy mixed.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Then Moath pointed where a cloud</l>
<l rend="i0">Of Locusts, from the desolated fields</l>
<l rend="i4">Of Syria, winged their way.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Lo! how created things</l>
<l rend="i4">"Obey the written doom!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Onward they came, a dark continuous cloud</l>
<l rend="i0">Of congregated myriads numberless,</l>
<l rend="i0">The rushing of whose wings was as the sound</l>
<l rend="i0">Of a broad river, headlong in its course</l>
<l rend="i0">Plunged from a mountain summit, or the roar</l>
<l rend="i0">Of a wild ocean in the autumn storm,</l>
<l rend="i0">Shattering its billows on a shore of rocks.</l>
<l rend="i0">Onward they came, the winds impelled them on,</l>
<l rend="i0">Their work was done, their path of<ptr target="#FNanchor_66_66"/> ruin past,</l>
<l rend="i0">Their graves were ready in the wilderness.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Behold the mighty army!" Moath cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Blindly they move, impelled</l>
<l rend="i4">"By the blind Element.</l>
<l rend="i0">"And yonder Birds our welcome visitants,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Lo! where they soar above the embodied host,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Pursue their way, and hang upon their rear,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And thin their spreading flanks,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Rejoicing o'er their banquet! deemest thou</l>
<l rend="i0">"The scent of water, on the Syrian mosque</l>
<l rend="i0">"Placed with priest-mummery, and the jargon-rites</l>
<l rend="i0">"That fool the multitude, has led them here</l>
<l rend="i0">"From far Khorasan?<ptr target="#FNanchor_67_67"/> Allah who decreed</l>
<l rend="i0">"Yon tribe the plague and punishment of man,</l>
<l rend="i0">"These also hath he doomed to meet their way:</l>
<l rend="i4">"Both passive instruments</l>
<l rend="i4">"Of his all-acting will,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Sole mover he, and only spring of all."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">While thus he spake, Oneiza's eye looks up</l>
<l rend="i4">Where one towards her flew,</l>
<l rend="i0">Satiate, for so it seemed, with sport and food.</l>
<l rend="i4">The Bird flew over her,</l>
<l rend="i4">And as he past above,</l>
<l rend="i0">From his relaxing grasp a Locust fell....</l>
<l rend="i2">It fell upon the Maiden's robe,</l>
<l rend="i0">And feebly there it stood, recovering slow.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The admiring girl surveyed</l>
<l rend="i4">His out-spread sails of green.</l>
<l rend="i4">His gauzy underwings,</l>
<l rend="i0">One closely to the grass green body furled,</l>
<l rend="i0">One ruffled in the fall, and half unclosed.</l>
<l rend="i4">She viewed his jet-orbed eyes</l>
<l rend="i4">His glossy gorget bright</l>
<l rend="i4">Green-glittering in the sun;</l>
<l rend="i4">His plumy pliant horns</l>
<l rend="i4">That, nearer as she gazed,</l>
<l rend="i2">Bent tremblingly before her breath.</l>
<l rend="i2">She viewed his yellow-circled front</l>
<l rend="i4">With lines mysterious veined;</l>
<l rend="i2">"And knowest thou what is written here,</l>
<l rend="i4">"My father?" said the Maid.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Look Thalaba! perchance these lines</l>
<l rend="i2">"Are in the letters of the Ring,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Nature's own language written here."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">The youth bent down, and suddenly</l>
<l rend="i4">He started, and his heart</l>
<l rend="i4">Sprung, and his cheek grew red,</l>
<l rend="i0">For the mysterious<ptr target="#FNanchor_68_68"/> lines were legible,</l>
<l rend="i2"><hi rend="smallcap">When the sun shall be darkened at noon</hi>,</l>
<l rend="i4"><hi rend="smallcap">Son of Hodeirah, depart.</hi></l>
<l rend="i0">And Moath looked, and read the lines aloud;</l>
<l rend="i2">The Locust shook his wings and fled,</l>
<l rend="i4">And they were silent all.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Who then rejoiced but Thalaba?</l>
<l rend="i0">Who then was troubled but the Arabian Maid?</l>
<l rend="i4">And Moath sad of heart,</l>
<l rend="i0">Tho' with a grief supprest, beheld the youth</l>
<l rend="i4">Sharpen his arrows now,</l>
<l rend="i4">And now new-plume their shafts,</l>
<l rend="i2">Now to beguile impatient hope</l>
<l rend="i4">Feel every sharpened point.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Why is that anxious look," Oneiza cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Still upwards cast at noon?</l>
<l rend="i0">"Is Thalaba aweary of our tent?"</l>
<l rend="i2">"I would be gone," the youth replied,</l>
<l rend="i4">"That I might do my task,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And full of glory to the tent return</l>
<l rend="i4">"Whence I should part no more."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">But on the noontide sun,</l>
<l rend="i0">As anxious and as oft Oneiza's eye</l>
<l rend="i4">Was upward glanced in fear.</l>
<l rend="i0">And now as Thalaba replied, her cheek</l>
<l rend="i4">Lost its fresh and lively hue,</l>
<l rend="i4">For in the Sun's bright edge</l>
<l rend="i0">She saw, or thought she saw, a little speck.</l>
<l rend="i4">The sage Astronomer</l>
<l rend="i2">Who with the love of science full</l>
<l rend="i0">Trembled that day at every passing cloud,</l>
<l rend="i0">He had not seen it, 'twas a speck so small.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Alas! Oneiza sees the spot increase!</l>
<l rend="i4">And lo! the ready Youth</l>
<l rend="i0">Over his shoulder the full quiver slings</l>
<l rend="i4">And grasps the slackened bow.</l>
<l rend="i4">It spreads, and spreads, and now</l>
<l rend="i4">Has shaddowed half the Sun,</l>
<l rend="i4">Whose crescent-pointed horns</l>
<l rend="i4">Now momently decrease.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">The day grows dark, the Birds retire to rest;</l>
<l rend="i4">Forth from her shadowy haunt</l>
<l rend="i0">Flies the large-headed<ptr target="#FNanchor_69_69"/> Screamer of the night.</l>
<l rend="i2">Far off the affrighted African,</l>
<l rend="i4">Deeming his God deceased,</l>
<l rend="i4">Falls on his knees in prayer,</l>
<l rend="i4">And trembles as he sees</l>
<l rend="i4">The fierce Hyena's eyes</l>
<l rend="i0">Glare in the darkness of that dreadful noon.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Then Thalaba exclaimed, "Farewell,</l>
<l rend="i0">"My father! my Oneiza!" the Old Man</l>
<l rend="i4">Felt his throat swell with grief.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Where wilt thou go my Child?" he cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Wilt thou not wait a sign</l>
<l rend="i4">"To point thy destined way?"</l>
<l rend="i0">"God will conduct me!" said the noble youth,</l>
<l rend="i4">He said and from the Tent</l>
<l rend="i0">In the depth of the darkness departed.</l>
<l rend="i4">They heard his parting steps,</l>
<l rend="i0">The quiver rattling as he past away.</l>
</lg>

</div><div type="book"><head>THE FOURTH BOOK.</head>
<lg>
<l rend="i4">Whose is yon dawning form,</l>
<l rend="i4">That in the darkness meets</l>
<l rend="i4">The delegated youth?</l>
<l rend="i0">Dim as the shadow of a fire at noon,</l>
<l rend="i0">Or pale reflection on the evening brook</l>
<l rend="i4">Of Glow-worm on the bank</l>
<l rend="i0">Kindled to guide her winged paramour.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">A moment, and the brightening image shaped</l>
<l rend="i0">His Mother's form and features. "Go," she cried,</l>
<l rend="i0">"To Babylon, and from the Angels learn</l>
<l rend="i2">"What talisman thy task requires."</l>
<l rend="i0">The Spirit hung towards him when she ceased,</l>
<l rend="i0">As tho' with actual lips she would have given</l>
<l rend="i2">A mother's kiss ... his arms outstretched,</l>
<l rend="i4">His body bending on,</l>
<l rend="i0">His lips unclosed and trembling into speech</l>
<l rend="i0">He prest to meet the blessing,... but the wind</l>
<l rend="i0">Played on his cheek: he looked, and he beheld</l>
<l rend="i0">The darkness close. "Again! again!" he cried,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Let me again behold thee!" from the darkness</l>
<l rend="i4">His Mother's voice went forth;</l>
<l rend="i0">"Thou shall behold me in the hour of death."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Day dawns, the twilight gleam dilates,</l>
<l rend="i2">The Sun comes forth and like a God</l>
<l rend="i4">Rides thro' rejoicing heaven.</l>
<l rend="i0">Old Moath and his daughter from their tent</l>
<l rend="i4">Beheld the adventurous youth,</l>
<l rend="i4">Dark moving o'er the sands,</l>
<l rend="i0">A lessening image, trembling thro' their tears.</l>
<l rend="i4">Visions of high emprize</l>
<l rend="i4">Beguiled his lonely road;</l>
<l rend="i2">And if sometimes to Moath's tent</l>
<l rend="i2">The involuntary mind recurred,</l>
<l rend="i0">Fancy, impatient of all painful thoughts</l>
<l rend="i0">Pictured the bliss should welcome his return.</l>
<l rend="i4">In dreams like these he went,</l>
<l rend="i4">And still of every dream</l>
<l rend="i4">Oneiza formed a part,</l>
<l rend="i0">And Hope and Memory made a mingled joy.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">In the eve he arrived at a Well,</l>
<l rend="i2">The Acacia bent over its side,</l>
<l rend="i2">Under whose long light-hanging boughs</l>
<l rend="i4">He chose his night's abode.</l>
<l rend="i0">There, due ablutions made and prayers performed,</l>
<l rend="i4">The youth his mantle spread,</l>
<l rend="i4">And silently produced</l>
<l rend="i4">His solitary meal.</l>
<l rend="i0">The silence and the solitude recalled</l>
<l rend="i0">Dear recollections, and with folded arms,</l>
<l rend="i0">Thinking of other days, he sate, till thought</l>
<l rend="i0">Had left him, and the Acacia's moving shade</l>
<l rend="i4">Upon the sunny sand</l>
<l rend="i4">Had caught his idle eye,</l>
<l rend="i4">And his awakened ear</l>
<l rend="i4">Heard the grey Lizard's chirp,</l>
<l rend="i4">The only sound of life.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">As thus in vacant quietness he sate,</l>
<l rend="i0">A Traveller on a Camel reached the Well,</l>
<l rend="i4">And courteous greeting gave.</l>
<l rend="i2">The mutual salutation past,</l>
<l rend="i0">He by the cistern too his garment spread,</l>
<l rend="i0">And friendly converse cheered the social meal.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">The Stranger was an antient man,</l>
<l rend="i4">Yet one whose green old age</l>
<l rend="i0">Bore the fair characters of temperate youth.</l>
<l rend="i0">So much of manhood's strength his limbs retained,</l>
<l rend="i0">It seemed he needed not the staff he bore.</l>
<l rend="i2">His beard was long, and grey, and crisp;</l>
<l rend="i4">Lively his eyes and quick,</l>
<l rend="i4">And reaching over them</l>
<l rend="i4">The large broad eye-brow curled....</l>
<l rend="i0">His speech was copious, and his winning words</l>
<l rend="i0">Enriched with knowledge, that the attentive youth</l>
<l rend="i2">Sate listening with a thirsty joy.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">So in the course of talk</l>
<l rend="i4">The adventurer youth enquired</l>
<l rend="i4">Whither his course was bent;</l>
<l rend="i0">The Old Man answered, "to Bagdad I go."</l>
<l rend="i0">At that so welcome sound a flash of joy</l>
<l rend="i2">Kindled the eye of Thalaba;</l>
<l rend="i4">"And I too," he replied,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Am journeying thitherward,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Let me become companion of thy way!"</l>
<l rend="i4">Courteous the Old Man smiled,</l>
<l rend="i4">And willing in assent....</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">OLD MAN.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Son, thou art young for travel.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i12">Until now</l><l rend="i0">I never past the desert boundary.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">OLD MAN.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">It is a noble city that we seek.</l>
<l rend="i0">Thou wilt behold magnificent palaces,</l>
<l rend="i0">And lofty obelisks, and high-domed Mosques,</l>
<l rend="i0">And rich Bazars, whither from all the world</l>
<l rend="i0">Industrious merchants meet, and market there</l>
<l rend="i0">The World's collected wealth.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i10">Stands not Bagdad</l><l rend="i0">Near to the site of ancient Babylon</l>
<l rend="i0">And Nimrod's impious temple?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">OLD MAN.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i11">From the walls</l><l rend="i0">'Tis but a long day's distance.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i12">And the ruins?</l></lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">OLD MAN.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">A mighty mass remains; enough to tell us</l>
<l rend="i0">How great our <ptr target="#FNanchor_70_70"/>fathers were, how little we.</l>
<l rend="i0">Men are not what they were; their crimes and follies</l>
<l rend="i0">Have dwarfed them down from the old hero race</l>
<l rend="i0">To such poor things as we!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i10">At Babylon</l><l rend="i0">I have heard the Angels expiate their guilt,</l>
<l rend="i0">Haruth and Maruth.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">OLD MAN.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">'Tis a history</l>
<l rend="i0">Handed from ages down; the nurses make it</l>
<l rend="i0">A tale to please their children,</l>
<l rend="i0">And as their garrulous ignorance relates</l>
<l rend="i0">We learn it and believe ... but all things feel</l>
<l rend="i0">The power of Time and Change! thistles and grass</l>
<l rend="i0">Usurp the desolate palace, and the weeds</l>
<l rend="i0">Of Falshood root in the aged pile of Truth.</l>
<l rend="i0">How have you heard the tale?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i12">Thus ... on a time</l><l rend="i0">The Angels at the wickedness of man</l>
<l rend="i0">Expressed indignant wonder: that in vain</l>
<l rend="i0">Tokens and signs were given, and Prophets sent,...</l>
<l rend="i0">Strange obstinacy this! a stubborness</l>
<l rend="i0">Of sin, they said, that should for ever bar</l>
<l rend="i0">The gates of mercy on them. Allah heard</l>
<l rend="i0">Their unforgiving pride, and bade that two</l>
<l rend="i0">Of these untempted Spirits should descend,</l>
<l rend="i0">Judges on earth. Haruth and Maruth went,</l>
<l rend="i0">The chosen Sentencers; they fairly heard</l>
<l rend="i0">The appeals of men to their tribunal brought,</l>
<l rend="i0">And rightfully decided. At the length</l>
<l rend="i0">A Woman came before them ... beautiful</l>
<l rend="i0">Zohara was, as yonder Evening star,</l>
<l rend="i0">In the mild lustre<ptr target="#FNanchor_71_71"/> of whose lovely light</l>
<l rend="i0">Even now her beauty shines. They gazed on her</l>
<l rend="i0">With fleshly eyes, they tempted her to sin.</l>
<l rend="i0">The wily woman listened, and required</l>
<l rend="i0">A previous price, the knowledge of the name<ptr target="#FNanchor_72_72"/></l>
<l rend="i0">Of God. She learnt the wonder-working name</l>
<l rend="i0">And gave it utterance, and its virtue bore her</l>
<l rend="i0">Up to the glorious Presence, and she told</l>
<l rend="i0">Before the aweful Judgement-Seat, her tale.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">OLD MAN.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">I know the rest, the accused Spirits were called:</l>
<l rend="i0">Unable of defence, and penitent,</l>
<l rend="i0">They owned their crime and heard the doom deserved.</l>
<l rend="i0">Then they besought the Lord that not for ever</l>
<l rend="i0">His wrath might be upon them; and implored</l>
<l rend="i0">That penal ages might at length restore them</l>
<l rend="i0">Clean from offence, since then by Babylon</l>
<l rend="i0">In the cavern of their punishment they dwell,</l>
<l rend="i0">Runs the conclusion so?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i10">So I am taught.</l></lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">OLD MAN.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">The common tale! and likely thou hast heard</l>
<l rend="i0">How that the bold and bad, with impious rites</l>
<l rend="i0">Intrude upon their penitence, and force,</l>
<l rend="i0">Albeit from loathing and reluctant lips,</l>
<l rend="i0">The sorcery-secret?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">Is it not the truth?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">OLD MAN.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Son, thou hast seen the Traveller in the sands</l>
<l rend="i0">Move in the dizzy light of the hot noon,</l>
<l rend="i0">Huge<ptr target="#FNanchor_73_73"/> as the giant race of elder times,</l>
<l rend="i0">And his Camel, than the monstrous Elephant,</l>
<l rend="i0">Seem of a vaster bulk.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i10">A frequent sight.</l></lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">OLD MAN.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">And hast thou never in the twilight, fancied</l>
<l rend="i0">Familiar object into some strange shape</l>
<l rend="i0">And form uncouth?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">Aye! many a time.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">OLD MAN.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i14">Even so</l><l rend="i0">Things viewed at distance thro' the mist of fear,</l>
<l rend="i0">In their distortion terrify and shock</l>
<l rend="i0">The abused sight.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i6">   But of these Angels fate</l>
<l rend="i0">Thus in the uncreated Book is written.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">OLD MAN.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Wisely from legendary fables, Heaven</l>
<l rend="i0">Inculcates wisdom.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i6">   How then is the truth?</l>
<l rend="i0">Is not the dungeon of their punishment</l>
<l rend="i0">By ruined Babylon?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">OLD MAN.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">By Babylon</l>
<l rend="i0">Haruth and Maruth may be found.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
<l rend="i12">   And there</l><l rend="i0">Magician learn their impious sorcery?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">OLD MAN.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Son what thou sayest is true, and it is false.</l>
<l rend="i0">But night approaches fast; I have travelled far</l>
<l rend="i0">And my old lids are heavy ... on our way</l>
<l rend="i0">We shall have hours for converse, let us now</l>
<l rend="i0">Turn to our due repose. Son, peace be with thee!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">So in his loosened cloak</l>
<l rend="i4">The Old Man wrapt<ptr target="#FNanchor_74_74"/> himself</l>
<l rend="i4">And laid his limbs at length:</l>
<l rend="i0">And Thalaba in silence laid him down.</l>
<l rend="i0">Awhile he lay and watched the lovely Moon,</l>
<l rend="i4">O'er whose broad orb the boughs</l>
<l rend="i4">A mazy fretting framed,</l>
<l rend="i2">Or with a pale transparent green</l>
<l rend="i4">Lighting the restless leaves,</l>
<l rend="i0">The thin Acacia leaves that played above.</l>
<l rend="i2">The murmuring wind, the moving leaves</l>
<l rend="i0">Lulled him to sleep with mingled lullabies.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Not so the dark Magician by his side,</l>
<l rend="i0">Lobaba, who from the Domdaniel caves</l>
<l rend="i4">Had sought the dreaded youth.</l>
<l rend="i0">Silent he lay, and simulating sleep,</l>
<l rend="i0">Till by the long and regular breath he knew</l>
<l rend="i4">The youth beside him slept.</l>
<l rend="i4">Carefully then he rose,</l>
<l rend="i0">And bending over him, surveyed him near</l>
<l rend="i4">And secretly he cursed</l>
<l rend="i4">The dead Abdaldar's ring,</l>
<l rend="i4">Armed by whose amulet</l>
<l rend="i4">He slept from danger safe.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Wrapped in his mantle Thalaba reposed,</l>
<l rend="i2">His loose right arm pillowing his head.</l>
<l rend="i4">The Moon was on the Ring,</l>
<l rend="i4">Whose crystal gem returned</l>
<l rend="i4">A quiet, moveless light.</l>
<l rend="i0">Vainly the Wizard vile put forth his hand</l>
<l rend="i4">And strove to reach the gem,</l>
<l rend="i0">Charms strong as hell could make them, made it safe.</l>
<l rend="i4">He called his servant fiends,</l>
<l rend="i0">He bade the Genii rob the sleeping youth.</l>
<l rend="i4">By the virtue of the Ring,</l>
<l rend="i4">By Mohammed's holier power,</l>
<l rend="i4">By the holiest name of God,</l>
<l rend="i0">Had Thalaba disarmed the evil race.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Baffled and weary, and convinced at length,</l>
<l rend="i0">Anger, and fear, and rancour gnawing him,</l>
<l rend="i0">The accursed Sorcerer ceased his vain attempts.</l>
<l rend="i4">Content perforce to wait</l>
<l rend="i4">Temptations likelier aid.</l>
<l rend="i0">Restless he lay, and brooding many a wile,</l>
<l rend="i2">And tortured with impatient hope,</l>
<l rend="i0">And envying with the bitterness of hate</l>
<l rend="i0">The innocent youth, who slept so sweetly by.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">The ray of morning on his eye lids fell,</l>
<l rend="i4">And Thalaba awoke</l>
<l rend="i2">And folded his mantle around him,</l>
<l rend="i2">And girded his loins for the day;</l>
<l rend="i0">Then the due rites of holiness observed.</l>
<l rend="i4">His comrade too arose,</l>
<l rend="i4">And with the outward forms</l>
<l rend="i0">Of righteousness and prayer insulted God.</l>
<l rend="i2">They filled their water skin, they gave</l>
<l rend="i4">The Camel his full draught.</l>
<l rend="i0">Then on their road while yet the morn was young</l>
<l rend="i4">And the air was fresh with dew,</l>
<l rend="i4">Forward the travellers went,</l>
<l rend="i0">With various talk beguiling the long way.</l>
<l rend="i2">But soon the youth, whose busy mind</l>
<l rend="i0">Dwelt on Lobaba's wonder-stirring words,</l>
<l rend="i0">Renewed the unfinished converse of the night.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Thou saidest that it is true, and yet is false,</l>
<l rend="i0">That men accurst, attain at Babylon</l>
<l rend="i0">Forbidden knowledge from the Angel pair....</l>
<l rend="i0">How mean you?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LOBABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i6">All things have a double power,</l>
<l rend="i0">Alike for good and evil, the same fire</l>
<l rend="i0">That on the comfortable hearth at eve</l>
<l rend="i0">Warmed the good man, flames o'er the house at night</l>
<l rend="i4">Should we for this forego</l>
<l rend="i4">The needful element?</l>
<l rend="i2">Because the scorching summer Sun</l>
<l rend="i0">Darts fever, wouldst thou quench the orb of day?</l>
<l rend="i0">Or deemest thou that Heaven in anger formed</l>
<l rend="i0">Iron to till the field, because when man</l>
<l rend="i0">Had tipt his arrows for the chase, he rushed</l>
<l rend="i0">A murderer to the war?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i10">What follows hence?</l></lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LOBABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">That nothing in itself is good or evil,</l>
<l rend="i0">But only in its use. Think you the man</l>
<l rend="i0">Praiseworthy who by painful study learns</l>
<l rend="i0">The knowledge of all simples, and their power</l>
<l rend="i0">Healing or harmful?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">All men hold in honour</l>
<l rend="i0">The skilful Leech. From land to land he goes</l>
<l rend="i0">Safe in his privilege; the sword of war</l>
<l rend="i0">Spares him, Kings welcome him with costly gifts,</l>
<l rend="i0">And he who late had from the couch of pain</l>
<l rend="i0">Lifted a languid look to him for aid,</l>
<l rend="i0">Views him with brightened eyes, and blesses him</l>
<l rend="i0">In his first thankful prayer.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LOBABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i10">Yet some there are</l><l rend="i0">Who to the purposes of wickedness,</l>
<l rend="i0">Apply this knowledge, and from herbs distil</l>
<l rend="i0">Poison to mix it in the trusted draught.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Allah shall cast them in the fire</l>
<l rend="i0">Whose fuel is the cursed! there shall they</l>
<l rend="i0">Endure the ever-burning agony</l>
<l rend="i0">Consuming<ptr target="#FNanchor_75_75"/> still in flames, and still renewed.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LOBABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">But is their knowledge therefore in itself</l>
<l rend="i0">Unlawful?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">That were foolishness to think.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LOBABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">O what a glorious animal were Man,</l>
<l rend="i0">Knew he but his own powers! and knowing gave them</l>
<l rend="i0">Room for their growth and spread! the Horse obeys</l>
<l rend="i0">His guiding will, the patient Camel bears him</l>
<l rend="i0">Over these wastes of sand, the Pigeon wafts</l>
<l rend="i0">His bidding thro' the sky: and with these triumphs</l>
<l rend="i0">He rests contented! with these ministers,</l>
<l rend="i0">When he might awe the Elements, and make</l>
<l rend="i0">Myriads of Spirits serve him!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i12">But as how!</l><l rend="i0">By a league with Hell, a covenant that binds</l>
<l rend="i0">The soul to utter death!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LOBABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i10">Was Solomon</l><l rend="i0">Accurst of God? yet to his talismans</l>
<l rend="i0">Obedient, o'er his throne the birds of Heaven</l>
<l rend="i0">Their waving wings<ptr target="#FNanchor_76_76"/> his sun-shield, fanned around him</l>
<l rend="i0">The motionless air of noon: from place to place,</l>
<l rend="i0">As his will reined the viewless Element</l>
<l rend="i0">He rode the Wind: the Genii reared his temple,</l>
<l rend="i0">And ceaselessly in fear while his dead eye</l>
<l rend="i0">O'erlooked them, day and night pursued their toil,</l>
<l rend="i0">So dreadful was his power.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i10">But 'twas from Heaven</l><l rend="i0">His wisdom came; God's special gift ... the guerdon</l>
<l rend="i0">Of early virtue.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LOBABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i6">Learn thou, O young man!</l>
<l rend="i0">God hath appointed Wisdom the reward</l>
<l rend="i0">Of study! 'tis a spring of living waters,</l>
<l rend="i0">Whose inexhaustible bounties all might drink</l>
<l rend="i0">But few dig deep enough. Son! thou art silent,...</l>
<l rend="i0">Perhaps I say too much,... perhaps offend thee.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Nay, I am young, and willingly as becomes me,</l>
<l rend="i0">Hear the wise words of age.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LOBABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i12">Is it a crime</l><l rend="i0">To mount the horse, because forsooth thy feet</l>
<l rend="i0">Can serve thee for the journey? is it sin</l>
<l rend="i0">Because the Hern soars upward in the sky</l>
<l rend="i0">Above the arrow's flight, to train the Falcon</l>
<l rend="i0">Whose beak shall pierce him there? the powers which All</l>
<l rend="i0">Granted to man, were granted for his use;</l>
<l rend="i0">All knowledge that befits not human weakness</l>
<l rend="i0">Is placed beyond its reach.... They who repair</l>
<l rend="i0">To Babylon, and from the Angels learn</l>
<l rend="i0">Mysterious wisdom, sin not in the deed.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Know you these secrets?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LOBABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i10">I? alas my Son</l><l rend="i0">My age just knows enough to understand</l>
<l rend="i0">How little all its knowledge! later years</l>
<l rend="i0">Sacred to study, teach me to regret</l>
<l rend="i0">Youth's unforeseeing indolence, and hours</l>
<l rend="i0">That cannot be recalled! something I know:</l>
<l rend="i0">The properties of herbs, and have sometimes</l>
<l rend="i0">Brought to the afflicted comfort and relief</l>
<l rend="i0">By the secrets of my art; under His blessing</l>
<l rend="i0">Without whom all had failed! Also of Gems</l>
<l rend="i0">I have some knowledge, and the characters</l>
<l rend="i0">That tell beneath what aspect they were set.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Belike you can interpret then the graving</l>
<l rend="i0">Around this Ring?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LOBABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">My sight is feeble, Son,</l>
<l rend="i0">And I must view it closer, let me try!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The unsuspecting Youth</l>
<l rend="i0">Held forth his linger to draw off the spell.</l>
<l rend="i4">Even whilst he held it forth,</l>
<l rend="i4">There settled there a Wasp,</l>
<l rend="i0">And just above the Gem infixed its dart.</l>
<l rend="i0">All purple swoln the hot and painful flesh</l>
<l rend="i4">Rose round the tightened Ring.</l>
<l rend="i0">The baffled Sorcerer knew the hand of Heaven,</l>
<l rend="i4">And inwardly blasphemed.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Ere long Lobaba's heart,</l>
<l rend="i0">Fruitful in wiles, devised new stratagem.</l>
<l rend="i4">A mist arose at noon;</l>
<l rend="i4">Like the loose hanging skirts</l>
<l rend="i0">Of some low cloud that, by the breeze impelled,</l>
<l rend="i4">Sweeps o'er the mountain side.</l>
<l rend="i4">With joy the thoughtless youth</l>
<l rend="i4">That grateful shadowing hailed;</l>
<l rend="i4">For grateful was the shade,</l>
<l rend="i2">While thro' the silver-lighted haze</l>
<l rend="i0">Guiding their way, appeared the beamless Sun.</l>
<l rend="i4">But soon that beacon failed;</l>
<l rend="i4">A heavier mass of cloud</l>
<l rend="i4">Impenetrably deep,</l>
<l rend="i4">Hung o'er the wilderness.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Knowest thou the track?" quoth Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Or should we pause, and wait the wind</l>
<l rend="i2">"To scatter this bewildering fog?"</l>
<l rend="i4">The Sorcerer answered him</l>
<l rend="i0">"Now let us hold right on,... for if we stray</l>
<l rend="i0">"The Sun tomorrow will direct our course."</l>
<l rend="i0">So saying, he towards the desert depths</l>
<l rend="i4">Misleads the youth deceived.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Earlier the night came on,</l>
<l rend="i0">Nor moon, nor stars, were visible in Heaven;</l>
<l rend="i0">And when at morn the youth unclosed his eyes</l>
<l rend="i0">He knew not where to turn his face in prayer.</l>
<l rend="i2">"What shall we do?" Lobaba cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The lights of Heaven have ceased</l>
<l rend="i4">"To guide us on our way.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Should we remain and wait</l>
<l rend="i4">"More favourable skies?</l>
<l rend="i0">"Soon would our food and water fail us here!</l>
<l rend="i4">"And if we venture on,</l>
<l rend="i0">"There are the dangers of the wilderness!"</l>
<l rend="i4">"Sure it were best proceed!"</l>
<l rend="i4">The chosen youth replies.</l>
<l rend="i0">"So haply we may reach some tent, or grove</l>
<l rend="i4">"Of dates, or stationed tribe.</l>
<l rend="i4">"But idly to remain</l>
<l rend="i0">"Were yielding effortless, and waiting death."</l>
<l rend="i0">The wily Sorcerer willingly assents,</l>
<l rend="i4">And farther in the sands,</l>
<l rend="i0">Elate of heart, he leads the credulous youth.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Still o'er the wilderness</l>
<l rend="i4">Settled the moveless mist.</l>
<l rend="i0">The timid Antelope that heard their steps</l>
<l rend="i0">Stood doubtful where to turn in that dim light,</l>
<l rend="i0">The Ostrich, blindly hastening, met them full.</l>
<l rend="i4">At night again in hope,</l>
<l rend="i4">Young Thalaba laid down;</l>
<l rend="i0">The morning came, and not one guiding ray</l>
<l rend="i2">Thro' the thick mist was visible,</l>
<l rend="i0">The same deep moveless mist that mantled all.</l>
<l rend="i4">Oh for the Vulture's scream</l>
<l rend="i0">That haunts for prey the abode of humankind!</l>
<l rend="i2">Oh for the Plover's<ptr target="#FNanchor_77_77"/> pleasant cry</l>
<l rend="i4">To tell of water near!</l>
<l rend="i2">Oh for the Camel-driver's<ptr target="#FNanchor_78_78"/> song!</l>
<l rend="i2">For now the water-skin grows light,</l>
<l rend="i0">Tho' of the draught, more eagerly desired,</l>
<l rend="i0">Imperious prudence took with sparing thirst.</l>
<l rend="i2">Oft from the third night's broken sleep,</l>
<l rend="i4">As in his dreams he heard</l>
<l rend="i4">The sound of rushing winds,</l>
<l rend="i0">Started the anxious youth, and looked abroad,</l>
<l rend="i0">In vain! for still the deadly calm endured.</l>
<l rend="i4">Another day past on,</l>
<l rend="i4">The water-skin was drained,</l>
<l rend="i4">But then one hope arrived</l>
<l rend="i2">For there was motion in the air!</l>
<l rend="i2">The sound of the wind arose anon</l>
<l rend="i4">That scattered the thick mist,</l>
<l rend="i0">And lo! at length the lovely face of Heaven!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Alas ... a wretched scene</l>
<l rend="i4">Was opened on their view.</l>
<l rend="i2">They looked around, no wells were near,</l>
<l rend="i4">No tent, no human aid!</l>
<l rend="i0">Flat on the Camel lay the water-skin,</l>
<l rend="i0">And their dumb servant difficultly now,</l>
<l rend="i0">Over hot sands and under the hot sun,</l>
<l rend="i4">Dragged on with patient pain.</l>
<l rend="i2">But oh the joy! the blessed sight!</l>
<l rend="i0">When in the burning waste the Travellers</l>
<l rend="i0">Saw a green meadow, fair with flowers besprent,</l>
<l rend="i0">Azure and yellow, like the beautiful fields</l>
<l rend="i0">Of England, when amid the growing grass</l>
<l rend="i0">The blue-bell bends, the golden king-cup shines,</l>
<l rend="i4">In the merry month of May!</l>
<l rend="i4">Oh joy! the Travellers</l>
<l rend="i0">Gaze on each other with hope-brightened eyes,</l>
<l rend="i2">For sure thro' that green meadow flows</l>
<l rend="i0">The living stream! and lo! their famished beast</l>
<l rend="i4">Sees the restoring sight!</l>
<l rend="i0">Hope gives his feeble limbs a sudden strength,</l>
<l rend="i0">He hurries on!</l>
<l rend="i6">The herbs so fair to eye</l>
<l rend="i0">Were Senna, and the Gentian's blossom blue,</l>
<l rend="i0">And kindred plants that with unwatered root</l>
<l rend="i0">Fed in the burning sand, whose bitter leaves</l>
<l rend="i4">Even frantic<ptr target="#FNanchor_79_79"/> Famine loathed.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">In uncommunicating misery</l>
<l rend="i0">Silent they stood. At length Lobaba cried,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Son we must slay the Camel, or we die</l>
<l rend="i0">"For lack of water! thy young hand is firm,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Draw forth the knife and pierce him!"</l>
<l rend="i12">Wretch accurst,</l><l rend="i0">Who that beheld thy venerable face,</l>
<l rend="i0">Thy features fixed with suffering, the dry lips,</l>
<l rend="i0">The feverish eyes, could deem that all within</l>
<l rend="i0">Was magic ease, and fearlessness secure,</l>
<l rend="i0">And wiles of hellish import? the young man</l>
<l rend="i0">Paused with reluctant pity: but he saw</l>
<l rend="i0">His comrade's red and painful countenance,</l>
<l rend="i0">And his own burning breath came short and quick,</l>
<l rend="i2">And at his feet the gasping beast</l>
<l rend="i4">Lies, over-worn with want.</l>
<l rend="i0">Then from his<ptr target="#FNanchor_80_80"/> girdle Thalaba took the knife</l>
<l rend="i0">With stern compassion, and from side to side</l>
<l rend="i4">Across<ptr target="#FNanchor_81_81"/> the Camel's throat,</l>
<l rend="i4">Drew deep the crooked blade.</l>
<l rend="i2">Servant of man, that merciful deed</l>
<l rend="i0">For ever ends thy suffering, but what doom</l>
<l rend="i0">Waits thy deliverer! "little will thy death</l>
<l rend="i4">"Avail us!" thought the youth,</l>
<l rend="i2">As in the water-skin he poured</l>
<l rend="i4">The Camel's hoarded draught:</l>
<l rend="i4">It gave a scant supply,</l>
<l rend="i0">The poor allowance of one prudent day.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Son of Hodeirah, tho' thy steady soul</l>
<l rend="i4">Despaired not, firm in faith,</l>
<l rend="i0">Yet not the less did suffering Nature feel</l>
<l rend="i0">Her pangs and trials, long their craving thirst</l>
<l rend="i0">Struggled with fear, by fear itself inflamed;</l>
<l rend="i4">But drop by drop, that poor,</l>
<l rend="i4">That last supply is drained!</l>
<l rend="i0">Still the same burning sun! no cloud in heaven!</l>
<l rend="i0">The hot air quivers, and the sultry mist</l>
<l rend="i2">Floats o'er the desert, with a show</l>
<l rend="i0">Of distant<ptr target="#FNanchor_82_82"/> waters, mocking their distress!</l>
<l rend="i4">The youth's parched lips were black,</l>
<l rend="i4">His tongue was<ptr target="#FNanchor_83_83"/> dry and rough,</l>
<l rend="i4">His eye-balls red with heat.</l>
<l rend="i2">His comrade gazed on him with looks</l>
<l rend="i0">That seemed to speak of pity, and he said</l>
<l rend="i4">"Let me behold thy Ring,</l>
<l rend="i0">"It may have virtue that can save us yet!"</l>
<l rend="i4">With that he took his hand</l>
<l rend="i4">And viewed the writing close,</l>
<l rend="i4">Then cried with sudden joy</l>
<l rend="i2">"It is a stone that whoso bears</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Genii must obey!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Now raise thy voice, my Son,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And bid them in his name that here is written</l>
<l rend="i4">"Preserve us in our need."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"Nay!" answered Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Shall I distrust the providence of God?</l>
<l rend="i4">"Is it not He must save?</l>
<l rend="i4">"If Allah wills it not</l>
<l rend="i4">"Vain were the Genii's aid."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Whilst he spake Lobaba's eye</l>
<l rend="i4">Full on the distance fixed,</l>
<l rend="i4">Attended not his speech.</l>
<l rend="i4">Its fearful meaning drew</l>
<l rend="i4">The looks of Thalaba.</l>
<l rend="i2">Columns of sand came moving on,</l>
<l rend="i4">Red in the burning ray</l>
<l rend="i4">Like obelisks of fire</l>
<l rend="i2">They rushed before the driving wind.</l>
<l rend="i4">Vain were all thoughts of flight!</l>
<l rend="i4">They had not hoped escape</l>
<l rend="i0">Could they have backed the Dromedary then</l>
<l rend="i4">Who in his rapid race</l>
<l rend="i0">Gives to the tranquil<ptr target="#FNanchor_84_84"/> air, a drowning force.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">High ... high in heaven upcurled</l>
<l rend="i4">The dreadful<ptr target="#FNanchor_85_85"/> columns moved,</l>
<l rend="i0">Swift, as the whirlwind that impelled their way,</l>
<l rend="i2">They rushed towards the Travellers!</l>
<l rend="i4">The old Magician shrieked,</l>
<l rend="i4">And lo! the foremost bursts,</l>
<l rend="i4">Before the whirlwind's force,</l>
<l rend="i0">Scattering afar a burning shower of sand.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Now by the virtue of the Ring</l>
<l rend="i4">"Save us!" Lobaba cried.</l>
<l rend="i4">"While yet thou hast the power</l>
<l rend="i4">"Save us. O save us! now!"</l>
<l rend="i4">The youth made no reply,</l>
<l rend="i0">Gazing in aweful wonder on the scene.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"Why dost thou wait?" the Old Man exclaimed,</l>
<l rend="i0">"If Allah and the Prophet will not save</l>
<l rend="i4">"Call on the Powers that will!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Ha! do I know thee, Infidel accurst?"</l>
<l rend="i4">Exclaimed the awakened youth.</l>
<l rend="i0">"And thou hast led me hither, Child of Sin!</l>
<l rend="i4">"That fear might make me sell</l>
<l rend="i4">"My soul to endless death!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"Fool that thou art!" Lobaba cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Call upon him whose name</l>
<l rend="i4">"Thy charmed signet bears,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Or die the death thy foolishness deserves!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Servant of Hell! die thou!" quoth Thalaba.</l>
<l rend="i4">And leaning on his bow</l>
<l rend="i4">He fitted the loose string,</l>
<l rend="i0">And laid the arrow in its resting-place.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Bow of my Father, do thy duty now!"</l>
<l rend="i2">He drew the arrow to its point,</l>
<l rend="i4">True to his eye it fled,</l>
<l rend="i4">And full upon the breast</l>
<l rend="i4">It smote the wizard man.</l>
<l rend="i2">Astonished Thalaba beheld</l>
<l rend="i4">The blunted point recoil.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">A proud and bitter smile</l>
<l rend="i4">Wrinkled Lobaba's cheek,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Try once again thine earthly arms!" he cried.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Rash Boy! the Power I serve</l>
<l rend="i2">"Abandons not his votaries.</l>
<l rend="i0">"It is for Allah's wretched slaves, like thou,</l>
<l rend="i0">"To serve a master, who in the hour of need</l>
<l rend="i4">"Forsakes them to their fate!</l>
<l rend="i0">"I leave thee!"... and he shook his staff, and called</l>
<l rend="i4">The Chariot of his Charms.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Swift as the viewless wind,</l>
<l rend="i4">Self-moved, the Chariot came,</l>
<l rend="i4">The Sorcerer mounts the seat.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Yet once more weigh thy danger!" he exclaimed,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Ascend the car with me,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And with the speed of thought</l>
<l rend="i4">"We pass the desert bounds."</l>
<l rend="i0">The indignant youth vouchsafed not to reply,</l>
<l rend="i0">And lo! the magic car begins its course!</l>
<l rend="i2">Hark! hark!... he screams.... Lobaba screams!</l>
<l rend="i4">What wretch, and hast thou raised</l>
<l rend="i0">The rushing Terrors of the Wilderness</l>
<l rend="i4">To fall on thine own head?</l>
<l rend="i2">Death! death! inevitable death!</l>
<l rend="i4">Driven by the breath of God</l>
<l rend="i0">A column of the Desert met his way.</l></lg>

<l rend="i0">When Thalaba from adoration rose,</l>
<l rend="i4">The air was cool, the sky</l>
<l rend="i4">With welcome clouds o'ercast,</l>
<l rend="i4">That soon came down in rain.</l>
<l rend="i0">He lifted up his fevered face to heaven,</l>
<l rend="i2">And bared his head and stretched his hands</l>
<l rend="i4">To that delightful shower,</l>
<l rend="i0">And felt the coolness flow thro' every limb</l>
<l rend="i4">Freshening his powers of life.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">A loud quick panting! Thalaba looks up,</l>
<l rend="i2">He starts, and his instinctive hand</l>
<l rend="i2">Grasps the knife hilt: for close beside</l>
<l rend="i4">A Tyger passes him.</l>
<l rend="i2">An indolent and languid eye</l>
<l rend="i4">The passing Tyger turned;</l>
<l rend="i4">His head was hanging down,</l>
<l rend="i4">His dry tongue lolling low,</l>
<l rend="i0">And the short panting of his fevered breath</l>
<l rend="i0">Came thro' his hot parched nostrils painfully.</l>
<l rend="i4">The young Arabian knew</l>
<l rend="i2">The purport of his hurried pace,</l>
<l rend="i4">And following him in hope</l>
<l rend="i4">Saw joyful from afar</l>
<l rend="i4">The Tyger stoop and drink.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">The desert Pelican had built her nest</l>
<l rend="i4">In that deep solitude.</l>
<l rend="i2">And now returned from distant flight</l>
<l rend="i4">Fraught with the river stream,</l>
<l rend="i0">Her load of water had disburthened there.</l>
<l rend="i2">Her young in the refreshing bath</l>
<l rend="i4">Sported all wantonness;</l>
<l rend="i4">Dipt down their callow heads,</l>
<l rend="i0">Filled the swoln membrane from their plumeless throat</l>
<l rend="i4">Pendant, and bills yet soft,</l>
<l rend="i4">And buoyant with arched breast,</l>
<l rend="i4">Plied in unpractised stroke</l>
<l rend="i4">The oars of their broad feet.</l>
<l rend="i0">They, as the spotted prowler of the wild</l>
<l rend="i0">Laps the cool wave, around their mother croud,</l>
<l rend="i0">And nestle underneath her outspread wings.</l>
<l rend="i4">The spotted prowler of the wild</l>
<l rend="i0">Lapt the cool wave,<ptr target="#FNanchor_86_86"/> and satiate from the nest,</l>
<l rend="i4">Guiltless of blood, withdrew.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">The mother bird had moved not</l>
<l rend="i2">But cowering o'er her nestlings,</l>
<l rend="i2">Sate confident and fearless,</l>
<l rend="i4">And watched the wonted guest.</l>
<l rend="i0">But when the human visitant approached,</l>
<l rend="i4">The alarmed Pelican</l>
<l rend="i2">Retiring from that hostile shape,</l>
<l rend="i0">Gathers her young, and menaces with wings,</l>
<l rend="i2">And forward thrusts her threatening neck,</l>
<l rend="i2">Its feathers ruffling in her wrath,</l>
<l rend="i4">Bold with maternal fear.</l>
<l rend="i0">Thalaba drank and in the water-skin</l>
<l rend="i2">Hoarded the precious element.</l>
<l rend="i0">Not all he took, but in the large nest left</l>
<l rend="i4">Store that sufficed for life.</l>
<l rend="i0">And journeying onward blest the Carrier Bird,</l>
<l rend="i4">And blest in thankfulness,</l>
<l rend="i0">Their common Father, provident for all.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">With strength renewed and confident in faith</l>
<l rend="i2">The son of Hodeirah proceeds;</l>
<l rend="i0">Till after the long toil of many a day,</l>
<l rend="i4">At length Bagdad appeared,</l>
<l rend="i4">The City of his search.</l>
<l rend="i4">He hastening to the gate</l>
<l rend="i0">Roams o'er the city with insatiate eyes,</l>
<l rend="i0">Its thousand dwellings o'er whose level roofs</l>
<l rend="i0">Fair cupolas appeared, and high-domed mosques</l>
<l rend="i0">And pointed minarets, and cypress groves</l>
<l rend="i0">Every where scattered<ptr target="#FNanchor_87_87"/> in unwithering green.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Thou too art fallen, Bagdad! City of<ptr target="#FNanchor_88_88"/> Peace,</l>
<l rend="i4">Thou too hast had thy day!</l>
<l rend="i0">And loathsome Ignorance and brute Servitude</l>
<l rend="i4">Pollute thy dwellings now,</l>
<l rend="i0">Erst for the Mighty and the Wise renowned.</l>
<l rend="i0">O yet illustrious for remembered fame,</l>
<l rend="i0">Thy founder the <ptr target="#FNanchor_89_89"/>Victorious, and the pomp</l>
<l rend="i0">Of Haroun, for whose name by blood defiled,</l>
<l rend="i0">Jahia's, and the blameless Barmecides',</l>
<l rend="i0">Genius hath wrought salvation; and the years</l>
<l rend="i0">When Science with the good Al-Maimon dwelt;</l>
<l rend="i0">So one day may the Crescent from thy Mosques</l>
<l rend="i0">Be plucked by Wisdom, when the enlightened arm</l>
<l rend="i0">Of Europe conquers to redeem the East.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Then Pomp and Pleasure dwelt within her walls</l>
<l rend="i0">The Merchants of the East and of the West</l>
<l rend="i4">Met in her arched<ptr target="#FNanchor_90_90"/> Bazars;</l>
<l rend="i4">All day the active poor</l>
<l rend="i0">Showered a cool comfort o'er her thronging streets;</l>
<l rend="i2">Labour was busy in her looms;</l>
<l rend="i4">Thro' all her open gates</l>
<l rend="i0">Long troops of laden Camels lined her roads,</l>
<l rend="i0">And Tigris on his tameless<ptr target="#FNanchor_91_91"/> current bore</l>
<l rend="i0">Armenian harvests to her multitudes.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">But not in sumptuous Caravansary</l>
<l rend="i4">The adventurer idles there,</l>
<l rend="i0">Nor satiates wonder with her pomp and wealth;</l>
<l rend="i2">A long day's distance from the walls</l>
<l rend="i4">Stands ruined Babylon!</l>
<l rend="i2">The time of action is at hand,</l>
<l rend="i2">The hope that for so many a year</l>
<l rend="i0">Hath been his daily thought, his nightly dream,</l>
<l rend="i4">Stings to more restlessness.</l>
<l rend="i0">He loathes all lingering that delays the hour</l>
<l rend="i0">When, full of glory, from his quest returned,</l>
<l rend="i0">He on the pillar of the Tent beloved</l>
<l rend="i4">Shall hang Hodeirah's sword.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The many-coloured<ptr target="#FNanchor_92_92"/> domes</l>
<l rend="i4">Yet wore one dusky hue,</l>
<l rend="i4">The Cranes upon the Mosque</l>
<l rend="i4">Kept their night-clatter<ptr target="#FNanchor_93_93"/> still,</l>
<l rend="i0">When thro' the gate the early Traveller past.</l>
<l rend="i0">And when at evening o'er the swampy plain</l>
<l rend="i4">The Bittern's<ptr target="#FNanchor_94_94"/> Boom came far,</l>
<l rend="i4">Distinct in darkness seen</l>
<l rend="i0">Above the low horizon's lingering light</l>
<l rend="i0">Rose the near ruins of old Babylon.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Once from her lofty walls<ptr target="#FNanchor_95_95"/> the Charioteer</l>
<l rend="i0">Looked down on swarming myriads; once she flung</l>
<l rend="i0">Her arches o'er Euphrates conquered tide,</l>
<l rend="i0">And thro' her brazen portals when she poured</l>
<l rend="i0">Her armies forth, the distant nations looked</l>
<l rend="i0">As men who watched the thunder-cloud in fear</l>
<l rend="i0">Lest it should burst above them. She was fallen,</l>
<l rend="i0">The Queen of Cities, Babylon was fallen!</l>
<l rend="i0">Low lay her bulwarks; the black scorpion basked</l>
<l rend="i0">In the palace courts, within her sanctuary</l>
<l rend="i4">The She Wolf hid her whelps.</l>
<l rend="i0">Is yonder huge and shapeless heap, what once</l>
<l rend="i0">Had been the aerial<ptr target="#FNanchor_96_96"/> Gardens, height on height</l>
<l rend="i0">Rising like Medias mountains crowned with wood,</l>
<l rend="i0">Work of imperial dotage? where the fame</l>
<l rend="i0">Of<ptr target="#FNanchor_97_97"/> Belus? where the Golden Image now,</l>
<l rend="i0">Which at the sound of dulcimer and lute,</l>
<l rend="i0">Cornet and sackbut, harp and psaltery,</l>
<l rend="i4">The Assyrian slaves adored?</l>
<l rend="i0">A labyrinth of ruins, Babylon</l>
<l rend="i4">Spreads o'er the blasted plain:</l>
<l rend="i0">The wandering Arab never sets his tent</l>
<l rend="i0">Within her walls; the Shepherd<ptr target="#FNanchor_98_98"/> eyes afar</l>
<l rend="i0">Her evil Towers, and devious drives his flock.</l>
<l rend="i0">Alone unchanged, a free and bridgeless tide</l>
<l rend="i4">Euphrates rolls along,</l>
<l rend="i4">Eternal Nature's work.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Thro' the broken portal,</l>
<l rend="i4">Over weedy fragments,</l>
<l rend="i4">Thalaba went his way.</l>
<l rend="i4">Cautious he trod, and felt</l>
<l rend="i0">The dangerous ground before him with his bow.</l>
<l rend="i2">The Chacal started at his steps,</l>
<l rend="i2">The Stork, alarmed at sound of man,</l>
<l rend="i0">From her broad nest upon the old pillar top,</l>
<l rend="i2">Affrighted fled on flapping wings.</l>
<l rend="i2">The Adder in her haunts disturbed</l>
<l rend="i0">Lanced at the intruding staff her arrowy tongue.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Twilight and moonshine dimly mingling gave</l>
<l rend="i4">An aweful light obscure,</l>
<l rend="i4">Evening not wholly closed,</l>
<l rend="i4">The Moon still pale and faint.</l>
<l rend="i4">An aweful light obscure,</l>
<l rend="i0">Broken by many a mass of blackest shade;</l>
<l rend="i0">Long column stretching dark thro' weeds and moss,</l>
<l rend="i4">Broad length of lofty wall</l>
<l rend="i4">Whose windows lay in light,</l>
<l rend="i0">And of their former shape, low-arched or square,</l>
<l rend="i4">Rude outline on the earth</l>
<l rend="i4">Figured, with long grass fringed.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Reclined against a column's broken shaft,</l>
<l rend="i0">Unknowing whitherward to bend his way</l>
<l rend="i4">He stood and gazed around.</l>
<l rend="i4">The Ruins closed him in,</l>
<l rend="i2">It seemed as if no foot of man</l>
<l rend="i2">For ages had intruded there.</l>
<l rend="i4">Soon at approaching step</l>
<l rend="i4">Starting, he turned and saw</l>
<l rend="i0">A warrior in the moon beam drawing near.</l>
<l rend="i4">Forward the Stranger came</l>
<l rend="i4">And with a curious eye</l>
<l rend="i4">Perused the Arab youth.</l>
<l rend="i4">"And who art thou," he cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"That at an hour like this</l>
<l rend="i4">"Wanderest in Babylon?</l>
<l rend="i0">"A way-bewildered traveller, seekest thou</l>
<l rend="i4">"The ruinous shelter here?</l>
<l rend="i4">"Or comest thou to hide</l>
<l rend="i4">"The plunder of the night?</l>
<l rend="i4">"Or hast thou spells to make</l>
<l rend="i0">"These ruins, yawning from their rooted base</l>
<l rend="i4">"Disclose their secret<ptr target="#FNanchor_99_99"/> wealth?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">The youth replied, "nor wandering traveller</l>
<l rend="i4">"Nor robber of the night</l>
<l rend="i4">"Nor skilled in spells am I.</l>
<l rend="i4">"I seek the Angels here,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Haruth and Maruth. Stranger in thy turn,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Why wanderest thou in Babylon,</l>
<l rend="i2">"And who art thou, the Questioner?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">The man was fearless, and the tempered pride</l>
<l rend="i2">That toned the voice of Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i0">Displeased not him, himself of haughty heart.</l>
<l rend="i2">Heedless he answered, "knowest thou</l>
<l rend="i4">"Their cave of punishment?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Vainly I seek it.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">STRANGER.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i6">Art thou firm of foot</l>
<l rend="i0">To tread the ways of danger?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i12">Point the path!</l></lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">STRANGER.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Young Arab! if thou hast a heart can beat</l>
<l rend="i0">Evenly in danger, if thy bowels yearn not</l>
<l rend="i0">With human fears, at scenes where undisgraced</l>
<l rend="i0">The soldier tried in battle might look back</l>
<l rend="i0">And tremble, follow me!... for I am bound</l>
<l rend="i0">Into that cave of horrors.</l>
<l rend="i10">Thalaba</l><l rend="i0">Gazed on his comrade, he was young, of port</l>
<l rend="i0">Stately and strong; belike his face had pleased</l>
<l rend="i0">A woman's eye, yet the youth read in it</l>
<l rend="i0">Unrestrained passions, the obdurate soul</l>
<l rend="i0">Bold in all evil daring; and it taught,</l>
<l rend="i0">By Nature's irresistible instinct, doubt</l>
<l rend="i0">Well timed and wary. Of himself assured,</l>
<l rend="i0">Fearless of man, and confident in faith,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Lead on!" cried Thalaba.</l>
<l rend="i4">Mohareb led the way;</l>
<l rend="i4">And thro' the ruined streets,</l>
<l rend="i4">And thro' the farther gate</l>
<l rend="i4">They past in silence on.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">What sound is borne on the wind?</l>
<l rend="i4">Is it the storm that shakes</l>
<l rend="i2">The thousand oaks of the forest?</l>
<l rend="i4">But Thalaba's long locks</l>
<l rend="i0">Flow down his shoulders moveless, and the wind</l>
<l rend="i0">In his loose mantle raises not one fold.</l>
<l rend="i4">Is it the river's roar</l>
<l rend="i2">Dashed down some rocky descent?</l>
<l rend="i4">Along the level plain</l>
<l rend="i4">Euphrates glides unheard.</l>
<l rend="i4">What sound disturbs the night,</l>
<l rend="i0">Loud as the summer forest in the storm,</l>
<l rend="i2">As the river that roars among rocks?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">And what the heavy cloud</l>
<l rend="i4">That hangs upon the vale,</l>
<l rend="i0">Thick as the mist o'er a well-watered plain</l>
<l rend="i0">Settling at evening, when the cooler air</l>
<l rend="i4">Lets its day-vapours fall;</l>
<l rend="i4">Black as the sulphur-cloud</l>
<l rend="i0">That thro' Vesuvius, or from Hecla's mouth</l>
<l rend="i2">Rolls up, ascending from the infernal fires.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">From Ait's bitumen<ptr target="#FNanchor_100_100"/> lake</l>
<l rend="i4">That heavy cloud ascends;</l>
<l rend="i4">That everlasting roar</l>
<l rend="i4">From where its gushing springs</l>
<l rend="i4">Boil their black billows up.</l>
<l rend="i4">Silent the Arab youth,</l>
<l rend="i2">Along the verge of that wide lake,</l>
<l rend="i4">Followed Mohareb's way</l>
<l rend="i0">Towards a ridge of rocks that banked its side.</l>
<l rend="i2">There from a cave with torrent force,</l>
<l rend="i4">And everlasting roar,</l>
<l rend="i4">The black bitumen rolled.</l>
<l rend="i2">The moonlight lay upon the rocks.</l>
<l rend="i4">Their crags were visible,</l>
<l rend="i4">The shade of jutting cliffs,</l>
<l rend="i0">And where broad lichens whitened some smooth spot,</l>
<l rend="i4">And where the ivy hung</l>
<l rend="i4">Its flowing tresses down.</l>
<l rend="i2">A little way within the cave</l>
<l rend="i0">The moonlight fell, glossing the sable tide</l>
<l rend="i4">That gushed tumultuous out.</l>
<l rend="i0">A little way it entered, then the rock</l>
<l rend="i0">Arching its entrance, and the winding way,</l>
<l rend="i4">Darkened the unseen depths.</l>
<l rend="i4">No eye of mortal man</l>
<l rend="i0">If unenabled by enchanted spell,</l>
<l rend="i4">Had pierced those fearful depths.</l>
<l rend="i4">For mingling with the roar</l>
<l rend="i0">Of the portentous torrent, oft were heard</l>
<l rend="i4">Shrieks, and wild yells that scared</l>
<l rend="i0">The brooding Eagle from her midnight nest.</l>
<l rend="i4">The affrighted countrymen</l>
<l rend="i4">Call it the Mouth of Hell;</l>
<l rend="i2">And ever when their way leads near</l>
<l rend="i2">They hurry with averted eyes,</l>
<l rend="i4">And dropping their beads<ptr target="#FNanchor_101_101"/> fast</l>
<l rend="i4">Pronounce the holy name.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">There pausing at the cavern mouth</l>
<l rend="i2">Mohareb turned to Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Now darest thou enter in?"</l>
<l rend="i4">"Behold!" the youth replied,</l>
<l rend="i0">And leading in his turn the dangerous way</l>
<l rend="i4">Set foot within the cave.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Stay Madman!" cried his comrade. "Wouldst thou rush</l>
<l rend="i4">"Headlong to certain death?</l>
<l rend="i4">"Where are thine arms to meet</l>
<l rend="i0">"The Guardian of the Passage?" a loud shriek</l>
<l rend="i0">That shook along the windings of the cave</l>
<l rend="i4">Scattered the youth's reply.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Mohareb when the long reechoing ceased</l>
<l rend="i4">Exclaimed, "Fate favoured thee,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Young Arab! when she wrote<ptr target="#FNanchor_102_102"/> upon thy brow</l>
<l rend="i4">"The meeting of to-night;</l>
<l rend="i4">"Else surely had thy name</l>
<l rend="i0">"This hour been blotted from the Book of Life!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">So saying from beneath</l>
<l rend="i4">His cloak a bag he drew;</l>
<l rend="i2">"Young Arab! thou art brave," he cried,</l>
<l rend="i0">"But thus to rush on danger unprepared,</l>
<l rend="i0">"As lions spring upon the hunter's spear,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Is blind, brute courage. Zohak<ptr target="#FNanchor_103_103"/> keeps the cave,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Giantly tyrant of primeval days.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Force cannot win the passage." Thus he said</l>
<l rend="i0">And from his wallet drew a human hand</l>
<l rend="i4">Shrivelled, and dry, and black,</l>
<l rend="i4">And fitting as he spake</l>
<l rend="i4">A taper in its hold,</l>
<l rend="i0">Pursued: "a murderer on the stake had died,</l>
<l rend="i0">"I drove the Vulture from his limbs, and lopt</l>
<l rend="i0">"The hand that did the murder, and drew up</l>
<l rend="i2">"The tendon-strings to close its grasp,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And in the sun and wind</l>
<l rend="i4">"Parched it, nine weeks exposed.</l>
<l rend="i0">"The Taper,... but not here the place to impart,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Nor hast thou done the rites,</l>
<l rend="i0">"That fit thee to partake the mystery.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Look! it burns clear, but with the air around</l>
<l rend="i0">"Its dead ingredients mingle deathiness.</l>
<l rend="i0">"This when the Keeper of the Cave shall feel,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Maugre the doom of Heaven,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The salutary<ptr target="#FNanchor_104_104"/> spell</l>
<l rend="i0">"Shall lull his penal agony to sleep</l>
<l rend="i4">"And leave the passage free."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Thalaba answered not.</l>
<l rend="i2">Nor was there time for answer now,</l>
<l rend="i4">For lo! Mohareb leads,</l>
<l rend="i4">And o'er the vaulted cave</l>
<l rend="i0">Trembles the accursed taper's feeble light.</l>
<l rend="i4">There where the narrowing chasm</l>
<l rend="i4">Rose loftier in the hill,</l>
<l rend="i0">Stood Zohak, wretched man, condemned to keep</l>
<l rend="i4">His Cave of punishment.</l>
<l rend="i4">His was the frequent scream</l>
<l rend="i0">Which far away the prowling Chacal heard</l>
<l rend="i4">And howled in terror back:</l>
<l rend="i4">For from his shoulders grew</l>
<l rend="i4">Two snakes of monster size,</l>
<l rend="i4">That ever at his head</l>
<l rend="i4">Aimed eager their keen teeth</l>
<l rend="i0">To satiate raving hunger with his brain.</l>
<l rend="i0">He in the eternal conflict oft would seize</l>
<l rend="i0">Their swelling necks, and in his giant grasp</l>
<l rend="i0">Bruise them, and rend their flesh with bloody nails,</l>
<l rend="i4">And howl for agony,</l>
<l rend="i0">Feeling the pangs he gave, for of himself</l>
<l rend="i0">Inseparable parts, his torturers grew.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">To him approaching now</l>
<l rend="i2">Mohareb held the withered arm</l>
<l rend="i2">The Taper of enchanted power.</l>
<l rend="i0">The unhallowed spell in hand unholy held</l>
<l rend="i0">Now ministered to mercy, heavily</l>
<l rend="i4">The wretche's eyelids closed,</l>
<l rend="i4">And welcome and unfelt</l>
<l rend="i4">Like the release of death</l>
<l rend="i0">A sudden sleep fell on his vital powers.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Yet tho' along the cave</l>
<l rend="i4">Lay Zohak's giant limbs,</l>
<l rend="i0">The twin-born serpents kept the narrow pass,</l>
<l rend="i4">Kindled their fiery eyes,</l>
<l rend="i0">Darted their tongues of terror, and rolled out</l>
<l rend="i4">Their undulating length,</l>
<l rend="i0">Like the long streamers of some gallant ship</l>
<l rend="i4">Buoyed on the wavy air,</l>
<l rend="i0">Still struggling to flow on and still withheld.</l>
<l rend="i4">The scent of living flesh</l>
<l rend="i4">Inflamed their appetite.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Prepared for all the perils of the cave</l>
<l rend="i0">Mohareb came. He from his wallet drew</l>
<l rend="i4">Two human heads yet warm.</l>
<l rend="i0">O hard of heart! whom not the visible power</l>
<l rend="i0">Of retributive Justice, and the doom</l>
<l rend="i4">Of Zohak in his sight,</l>
<l rend="i4">Deterred from equal crime!</l>
<l rend="i2">Two human heads, yet warm, he laid</l>
<l rend="i0">Before the scaly guardians of the pass.</l>
<l rend="i0">They to their wonted banquet of old years</l>
<l rend="i0">Turned eager, and the narrow pass was free.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">And now before their path</l>
<l rend="i4">The opening cave dilates;</l>
<l rend="i4">They reach a spacious vault</l>
<l rend="i0">Where the black river fountains burst their way.</l>
<l rend="i4">Now as a whirlwind's force</l>
<l rend="i4">Had centered on the spring,</l>
<l rend="i4">The gushing flood rolled up;</l>
<l rend="i4">And now the deadened roar</l>
<l rend="i0">Echoed beneath them, as its sudden pause</l>
<l rend="i4">Left wide a dark abyss,</l>
<l rend="i0">Adown whose fathomless gulphs the eye was lost.</l>
<l rend="i2">Blue flames that hovered o'er the springs</l>
<l rend="i0">Flung thro' the Cavern their uncertain light</l>
<l rend="i2">Now waving on the waves they lay,</l>
<l rend="i4">And now their fiery curls</l>
<l rend="i4">Flowed in long tresses up,</l>
<l rend="i0">And now contracting glowed with whiter heat.</l>
<l rend="i4">Then up they poured again</l>
<l rend="i0">Darting pale flashes thro' the tremulous air;</l>
<l rend="i0">The flames, the red and yellow sulphur-smoke,</l>
<l rend="i2">And the black darkness of the vault</l>
<l rend="i2">Commingling indivisibly.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Here," quoth Mohareb, "do the Angels dwell,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The Teachers of Enchantment." Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i4">Then raised his voice and cried,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Haruth and Maruth, hear me! not with rites</l>
<l rend="i0">"Accursed, to disturb your penitence</l>
<l rend="i4">"And learn forbidden lore,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Repentant Angels, seek I your abode.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Me Allah and the Prophet mission here,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Their chosen servant I.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Tell me the Talisman."...</l>
<l rend="i10">"And dost thou think"</l><l rend="i0">"Mohareb cried, as with a scornful smile</l>
<l rend="i0">He glanced upon his comrade, "dost thou think</l>
<l rend="i0">"To trick them of their secret? for the dupes</l>
<l rend="i0">"Of human-kind keep this lip-righteousness!</l>
<l rend="i4">"'Twill serve thee in the Mosque</l>
<l rend="i4">"And in the Market-place,</l>
<l rend="i4">"But Spirits view the heart.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Only by strong and torturing spells enforced,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Those stubborn Angels teach the charm</l>
<l rend="i4">"By which we must descend."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"Descend!" said Thalaba.</l>
<l rend="i4">But then the wrinkling smile</l>
<l rend="i4">Forsook Mohareb's cheek,</l>
<l rend="i0">And darker feelings settled on his brow.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Now by my soul," quoth he, "and I believe</l>
<l rend="i4">"Idiot! that I have led</l>
<l rend="i0">"Some camel-kneed prayer-monger thro' the cave!</l>
<l rend="i0">"What brings thee hither? thou shouldest have a hut</l>
<l rend="i0">"By some Saint's<ptr target="#FNanchor_105_105"/> grave beside the public way,</l>
<l rend="i4">"There to less-knowing fools</l>
<l rend="i4">"Retail thy Koran<ptr target="#FNanchor_106_106"/> scraps,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And in thy turn, die civet-like at last</l>
<l rend="i0">"In the dung-perfume of thy sanctity!...</l>
<l rend="i2">"Ye whom I seek! that, led by me,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Feet uninitiate tread</l>
<l rend="i4">"Your threshold, this atones!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Fit sacrifice he falls!"</l>
<l rend="i2">And forth he flashed his scymetar,</l>
<l rend="i4">And raised the murderous blow.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Then ceased his power; his lifted arm,</l>
<l rend="i4">Suspended by the spell,</l>
<l rend="i4">Hung impotent to strike.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Poor Hypocrite!" cried he,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And this then is thy faith</l>
<l rend="i0">"In Allah and the Prophet! they had failed</l>
<l rend="i0">"To save thee, but for Magic's stolen aid;</l>
<l rend="i0">"Yea, they had left thee yonder Serpent's meal,</l>
<l rend="i2">"But that, in prudent cowardice,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The chosen Servant of the Lord came in,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Safe follower of my path!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Blasphemer! dost thou boast of guiding me?"</l>
<l rend="i2">Kindling with pride quoth Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Blindly the wicked work</l>
<l rend="i4">"The righteous will of Heaven.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Sayest thou that diffident of God,</l>
<l rend="i4">"In magic spell I trust?</l>
<l rend="i4">"Liar! let witness this!"</l>
<l rend="i2">And he drew off Abdaldar's Ring</l>
<l rend="i4">And cast it in the gulph.</l>
<l rend="i4">A skinny hand came up</l>
<l rend="i4">And caught it as it fell,</l>
<l rend="i0">And peals of devilish laughter shook the Cave.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Then joy suffused Mohareb's cheek,</l>
<l rend="i4">And Thalaba beheld</l>
<l rend="i0">The blue blade gleam, descending to destroy.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The undefended youth</l>
<l rend="i4">Sprung forward, and he seized</l>
<l rend="i4">Mohareb in his grasp,</l>
<l rend="i2">And grappled with him breast to breast.</l>
<l rend="i0">Sinewy and large of limb Mohareb was,</l>
<l rend="i4">Broad-shouldered, and his joints</l>
<l rend="i4">Knit firm, and in the strife</l>
<l rend="i4">Of danger practised well.</l>
<l rend="i0">Time had not thus matured young Thalaba:</l>
<l rend="i4">But now the enthusiast mind,</l>
<l rend="i2">The inspiration of his soul</l>
<l rend="i4">Poured vigour like the strength</l>
<l rend="i4">Of madness thro' his frame.</l>
<l rend="i0">Mohareb reels before him! he right on</l>
<l rend="i4">With knee, with breast, with arm,</l>
<l rend="i4">Presses the staggering foe!</l>
<l rend="i4">And now upon the brink</l>
<l rend="i4">Of that tremendous spring,</l>
<l rend="i0">There with fresh impulse and a rush of force</l>
<l rend="i4">He thrust him from his hold.</l>
<l rend="i4">The upwhirling flood received</l>
<l rend="i4">Mohareb, then, absorbed,</l>
<l rend="i4">Engulphed him in the abyss.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Thalaba's breath came fast,</l>
<l rend="i4">And panting he breathed out</l>
<l rend="i2">A broken prayer of thankfulness.</l>
<l rend="i4">At length he spake and said,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Haruth and Maruth! are ye here?</l>
<l rend="i0">"Or has that evil guide misled my search?</l>
<l rend="i0">"I, Thalaba, the Servant of the Lord,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Invoke you. Hear me Angels! so may Heaven</l>
<l rend="i0">"Accept and mitigate your penitence.</l>
<l rend="i0">"I go to root from earth the Sorcerer brood,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Tell me the needful Talisman!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Thus as he spake, recumbent on the rock</l>
<l rend="i4">Beyond the black abyss,</l>
<l rend="i4">Their forms grew visible.</l>
<l rend="i0">A settled sorrow sate upon their brows,</l>
<l rend="i0">Sorrow alone, for trace of guilt and shame</l>
<l rend="i0">No more remained; and gradual as by prayer</l>
<l rend="i4">The sin was purged away,</l>
<l rend="i0">Their robe<ptr target="#FNanchor_107_107"/> of glory, purified of stain</l>
<l rend="i0">Resumed the lustre of its native light.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">In awe the youth received the answering voice,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Son of Hodeirah! thou hast proved it here;</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Talisman is Faith."</l></lg>

<div type="book"><head>THE SIXTH BOOK.</head><lg>
<l rend="i0">So from the inmost cavern, Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i2">Retrod the windings of the rock.</l>
<l rend="i2">Still on the ground the giant limbs</l>
<l rend="i4">Of Zohak were outstretched;</l>
<l rend="i4">The spell of sleep had ceased</l>
<l rend="i0">And his broad eyes were glaring on the youth:</l>
<l rend="i0">Yet raised he not his arm to bar the way,</l>
<l rend="i4">Fearful to rouse the snakes</l>
<l rend="i4">Now lingering o'er their meal.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Oh then, emerging from that dreadful cave,</l>
<l rend="i2">How grateful did the gale of night</l>
<l rend="i4">Salute his freshened sense!</l>
<l rend="i4">How full of lightsome joy,</l>
<l rend="i0">Thankful to Heaven, he hastens by the verge</l>
<l rend="i4">Of that bitumen lake,</l>
<l rend="i4">Whose black and heavy fumes,</l>
<l rend="i4">Surge heaving after surge,</l>
<l rend="i0">Rolled like the billowy and tumultuous sea.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">The song of many a bird at morn</l>
<l rend="i4">Aroused him from his rest.</l>
<l rend="i2">Lo! by his side a courser stood!</l>
<l rend="i4">More animate of eye,</l>
<l rend="i0">Of form more faultless never had he seen,</l>
<l rend="i0">More light of limbs and beautiful in strength,</l>
<l rend="i4">Among the race whose blood,</l>
<l rend="i0">Pure and unmingled, from the royal steeds</l>
<l rend="i4">Of <ptr target="#FNanchor_108_108"/>Solomon came down.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The chosen Arab's eye</l>
<l rend="i4">Glanced o'er his graceful shape,</l>
<l rend="i4">His rich caparisons,</l>
<l rend="i4">His crimson trappings gay.</l>
<l rend="i4">But when he saw the mouth</l>
<l rend="i4">Uncurbed, the unbridled neck,</l>
<l rend="i2">Then flushed his cheek, and leapt his heart,</l>
<l rend="i2">For sure he deemed that Heaven had sent</l>
<l rend="i0">The Courser, whom no erring hand should guide.</l>
<l rend="i4">And lo! the eager Steed</l>
<l rend="i2">Throws his head and paws the ground,</l>
<l rend="i4">Impatient of delay!</l>
<l rend="i4">Then up leapt Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i2">And away went the self-governed steed.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Far over the plain</l>
<l rend="i2">Away went the bridleless steed;</l>
<l rend="i0">With the dew of the morning his fetlocks were wet,</l>
<l rend="i0">The foam frothed his limbs in the journey of noon,</l>
<l rend="i0">Nor stayed he till over the westerly heaven</l>
<l rend="i2">The shadows of evening had spread.</l>
<l rend="i4">Then on a sheltered bank</l>
<l rend="i4">The appointed Youth reposed,</l>
<l rend="i0">And by him laid the docile courser down.</l>
<l rend="i2">Again in the grey of the morning</l>
<l rend="i4">Thalaba bounded up,</l>
<l rend="i4">Over hill, over dale</l>
<l rend="i2">Away goes the bridleless steed.</l>
<l rend="i4">Again at eve he stops</l>
<l rend="i4">Again the Youth descends.</l>
<l rend="i2">His load discharged, his errand done,</l>
<l rend="i2">Then bounded the courser away.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Heavy and dark the eve;</l>
<l rend="i4">The Moon was hid on high,</l>
<l rend="i2">A dim light only tinged the mist</l>
<l rend="i2">That crost her in the path of Heaven.</l>
<l rend="i4">All living sounds had ceased,</l>
<l rend="i0">Only the flow of waters near was heard,</l>
<l rend="i2">A low and lulling melody.</l>
<l rend="i4">Fasting, yet not of want</l>
<l rend="i0">Percipient, he on that mysterious steed</l>
<l rend="i4">Had reached his resting place,</l>
<l rend="i0">For expectation kept his nature up.</l>
<l rend="i4">The flow of waters now</l>
<l rend="i4">Awoke a feverish thirst:</l>
<l rend="i4">Led by the sound, he moved</l>
<l rend="i4">To seek the grateful wave.</l>
<l rend="i2">A meteor in the hazy air</l>
<l rend="i4">Played before his path;</l>
<l rend="i4">Before him now it rolled</l>
<l rend="i4">A globe of livid fire;</l>
<l rend="i0">And now contracted to a steady light,</l>
<l rend="i0">As when the solitary hermit prunes</l>
<l rend="i2">His lamp's long undulating flame:</l>
<l rend="i4">And now its wavy point</l>
<l rend="i0">Up-blazing rose, like a young cypress-tree</l>
<l rend="i4">Swayed by the heavy wind;</l>
<l rend="i2">Anon to Thalaba it moved,</l>
<l rend="i0">And wrapped him in its pale innocuous fire:</l>
<l rend="i4">Now in the darkness drowned</l>
<l rend="i4">Left him with eyes bedimmed,</l>
<l rend="i0">And now emerging<ptr target="#FNanchor_109_109"/> spread the scene to sight.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Led by the sound, and meteor-flame</l>
<l rend="i4">Advanced the Arab youth.</l>
<l rend="i0">Now to the nearest of the many rills</l>
<l rend="i4">He stoops; ascending steam</l>
<l rend="i4">Timely repels his hand,</l>
<l rend="i0">For from its source it sprung, a boiling tide.</l>
<l rend="i0">A second course with better hap he tries,</l>
<l rend="i4">The wave intensly cold</l>
<l rend="i4">Tempts to a copious draught.</l>
<l rend="i2">There was a virtue in the wave,</l>
<l rend="i4">His limbs that stiff with toil,</l>
<l rend="i0">Dragged heavy, from the copious draught received</l>
<l rend="i4">Lightness and supple strength.</l>
<l rend="i0">O'erjoyed, and deeming the benignant Power</l>
<l rend="i4">Who sent the reinless steed,</l>
<l rend="i0">Had blessed the healing waters to his use</l>
<l rend="i4">He laid him down to sleep;</l>
<l rend="i0">Lulled by the soothing and incessant sound,</l>
<l rend="i0">The flow of many waters, blending oft</l>
<l rend="i0">With shriller tones and deep low murmurings</l>
<l rend="i4">That from the fountain caves</l>
<l rend="i4">In mingled melody</l>
<l rend="i0">Like faery music, heard at midnight, came.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">The sounds that last he heard at night</l>
<l rend="i4">Awoke his sense at morn.</l>
<l rend="i0">A scene of wonders lay before his eyes.</l>
<l rend="i2">In mazy windings o'er the vale</l>
<l rend="i4">Wandered a thousand streams;</l>
<l rend="i0">They in their endless flow<ptr target="#FNanchor_110_110"/> had channelled deep</l>
<l rend="i2">The rocky soil o'er which they ran,</l>
<l rend="i2">Veining its thousand islet stones,</l>
<l rend="i0">Like clouds that freckle o'er the summer sky,</l>
<l rend="i0">The blue etherial ocean circling each</l>
<l rend="i4">And insulating all.</l>
<l rend="i0">A thousand shapes they wore, those islet stones,</l>
<l rend="i2">And Nature with her various tints</l>
<l rend="i2">Varied anew their thousand forms:</l>
<l rend="i4">For some were green with moss,</l>
<l rend="i2">Some rich with yellow lichen's gold,</l>
<l rend="i0">Or ruddier tinged, or grey, or silver-white,</l>
<l rend="i0">Or sparkling sparry radiance to the sun.</l>
<l rend="i4">Here gushed the fountains up,</l>
<l rend="i0">Alternate light and blackness, like the play</l>
<l rend="i0">Of sunbeams, on the warrior's burnished arms.</l>
<l rend="i2">Yonder the river rolled, whose bed,</l>
<l rend="i2">Their labyrinthine lingerings o'er</l>
<l rend="i4">Received the confluent rills.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">This was a wild and wonderous scene,</l>
<l rend="i2">Strange and beautiful, as where</l>
<l rend="i0">By Oton-tala, like a sea<ptr target="#FNanchor_111_111"/> of stars,</l>
<l rend="i0">The hundred sources of Hoangho burst.</l>
<l rend="i4">High mountains closed the vale,</l>
<l rend="i0">Bare rocky mountains, to all living things</l>
<l rend="i0">Inhospitable, on whose sides no herb</l>
<l rend="i0">Rooted, no insect fed, no bird awoke</l>
<l rend="i0">Their echoes, save the Eagle, strong of wing,</l>
<l rend="i2">A lonely plunderer, that afar</l>
<l rend="i4">Sought in the vales his prey.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Thither towards those mountains, Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i0">Advanced, for well he weened that there had Fate</l>
<l rend="i4">Destined the adventures end.</l>
<l rend="i0">Up a wide vale winding amid their depths,</l>
<l rend="i0">A stony vale between receding heights</l>
<l rend="i4">Of stone, he wound his way.</l>
<l rend="i0">A cheerless place! the solitary Bee</l>
<l rend="i0">Whose buzzing was the only sound of life</l>
<l rend="i4">Flew there on restless wing,</l>
<l rend="i0">Seeking in vain one blossom, where to fix.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Still Thalaba holds on,</l>
<l rend="i0">The winding vale now narrows on his way,</l>
<l rend="i4">And steeper of ascent</l>
<l rend="i2">Rightward and leftward rise the rocks,</l>
<l rend="i2">And now they meet across the vale.</l>
<l rend="i2">Was it the toil of human hands</l>
<l rend="i2">That hewed a passage in the rock,</l>
<l rend="i4">Thro' whose rude portal-way</l>
<l rend="i4">The light of heaven was seen?</l>
<l rend="i2">Rude and low the portal-way,</l>
<l rend="i2">Beyond the same<ptr target="#FNanchor_112_112"/> ascending straits</l>
<l rend="i4">Went winding up the wilds.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Still a bare, silent, solitary glen,</l>
<l rend="i0">A fearful silence and a solitude</l>
<l rend="i4">That made itself be felt.</l>
<l rend="i4">And steeper now the ascent,</l>
<l rend="i4">A rugged path, that tired</l>
<l rend="i0">The straining muscles, toiling slowly up.</l>
<l rend="i4">At length again a rock</l>
<l rend="i4">Stretched o'er the narrow vale.</l>
<l rend="i2">There also was a portal hewn,</l>
<l rend="i0">But gates of massy iron barred the way,</l>
<l rend="i4">Huge, solid, heavy-hinged.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">There hung a horn beside the gate,</l>
<l rend="i2">Ivory-tipt and brazen mouthed,</l>
<l rend="i4">He took the ivory tip,</l>
<l rend="i2">And thro' the brazen mouth he breathed;</l>
<l rend="i0">From rock to rock rebounding rung the blast,</l>
<l rend="i2">Like a long thunder peal!</l>
<l rend="i0">The gates of iron, by no human arm</l>
<l rend="i0">Unfolded, turning on their hinges slow,</l>
<l rend="i2">Disclosed the passage of the rock.</l>
<l rend="i2">He entered, and the iron gates</l>
<l rend="i4">Fell to, and closed him in.</l>
<l rend="i2">It was a narrow winding way,</l>
<l rend="i2">Dim lamps suspended from the vault</l>
<l rend="i0">Lent to the gloom an agitated light.</l>
<l rend="i4">Winding it pierced the rock,</l>
<l rend="i4">A long descending path</l>
<l rend="i4">By gates of iron closed;</l>
<l rend="i2">There also hung the horn beside</l>
<l rend="i2">Of ivory tip and brazen mouth,</l>
<l rend="i2">Again he took the ivory tip</l>
<l rend="i0">And gave the brazen mouth his voice again.</l>
<l rend="i2">Not now in thunder spake the horn,</l>
<l rend="i0">But poured a sweet and thrilling melody:</l>
<l rend="i0">The gates flew open, and a flood of light</l>
<l rend="i4">Rushed on his dazzled eyes.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Was it to earthly Eden lost so long,</l>
<l rend="i2">The youth had found the wonderous way?</l>
<l rend="i4">But earthly Eden boasts</l>
<l rend="i4">No terraced palaces,</l>
<l rend="i0">No rich pavilions bright with woven<ptr target="#FNanchor_113_113"/> gold.</l>
<l rend="i4">Like these that in the vale</l>
<l rend="i4">Rise amid odorous groves.</l>
<l rend="i4">The astonished Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i0">Doubting as tho' an unsubstantial dream</l>
<l rend="i4">Beguiled his passive sense,</l>
<l rend="i4">A moment closed his eyes;</l>
<l rend="i0">Still they were there ... the palaces and groves,</l>
<l rend="i0">And rich pavilions glittering golden light.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">And lo! a man, reverend in comely age</l>
<l rend="i4">Advancing meets the youth.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Favoured of Fortune," he exclaimed,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Go taste the joys of Paradise!</l>
<l rend="i0">"The reinless steed that ranges o'er the world</l>
<l rend="i0">"Brings hither those alone for lofty deeds</l>
<l rend="i0">"Marked by their horoscope; permitted here</l>
<l rend="i0">"A foretaste of the full beatitude,</l>
<l rend="i0">"That in heroic acts they may go on</l>
<l rend="i0">"More ardent, eager to return and reap</l>
<l rend="i0">"Endless enjoyment here, their destined meed.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Favoured of Fortune thou,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Go taste the joys of Paradise!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">This said, he turned away, and left</l>
<l rend="i4">The Youth in wonder mute;</l>
<l rend="i4">For Thalaba stood mute</l>
<l rend="i4">And passively received</l>
<l rend="i0">The mingled joy that flowed on every sense.</l>
<l rend="i4">Where'er his eye could reach</l>
<l rend="i2">Fair structures, rain bow-hued, arose;</l>
<l rend="i0">And rich pavilions thro' the opening woods</l>
<l rend="i0">Gleamed from their waving curtains sunny gold;</l>
<l rend="i2">And winding thro' the verdant vale</l>
<l rend="i4">Flowed streams of liquid light;</l>
<l rend="i2">And fluted cypresses reared up</l>
<l rend="i4">Their living obelisks;</l>
<l rend="i0">And broad-leaved<ptr target="#FNanchor_114_114"/> Zennars in long colonades</l>
<l rend="i4">O'er-arched delightful walks,</l>
<l rend="i0">Where round their trunks the thousand-tendril'd vine</l>
<l rend="i0">Wound up and hung the bows with greener wreaths,</l>
<l rend="i4">And clusters not their own.</l>
<l rend="i0">Wearied with endless beauty did his eyes</l>
<l rend="i0">Return for rest? beside him teems the earth</l>
<l rend="i0">With tulips, like the ruddy<ptr target="#FNanchor_115_115"/> evening streaked,</l>
<l rend="i0">And here the lily hangs her head of snow,</l>
<l rend="i2">And here amid her sable<ptr target="#FNanchor_116_116"/> cup</l>
<l rend="i0">Shines the red eye-spot, like one brightest star</l>
<l rend="i0">The solitary twinkler of the night,</l>
<l rend="i4">And here the rose expands</l>
<l rend="i4">Her paradise<ptr target="#FNanchor_117_117"/> of leaves.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Then on his ear what sounds</l>
<l rend="i4">Of harmony arose!</l>
<l rend="i0">Far music and the distance-mellowed song</l>
<l rend="i4">From bowers of merriment;</l>
<l rend="i4">The waterfall remote;</l>
<l rend="i2">The murmuring of the leafy groves;</l>
<l rend="i4">The single nightingale</l>
<l rend="i0">Perched in the Rosier by, so richly toned,</l>
<l rend="i0">That never from that most melodious bird,</l>
<l rend="i0">Singing a love-song to his brooding mate,</l>
<l rend="i2">Did Thracian shepherd by the grave</l>
<l rend="i2">Of Orpheus<ptr target="#FNanchor_118_118"/> hear a sweeter song;</l>
<l rend="i0">Tho' there the Spirit of the Sepulchre</l>
<l rend="i2">All his own power infuse, to swell</l>
<l rend="i4">The incense that he loves.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">And oh! what odours the voluptuous vale</l>
<l rend="i4">Scatters from jasmine bowers.</l>
<l rend="i4">From yon rose wilderness,</l>
<l rend="i0">From clustered henna, and from orange groves</l>
<l rend="i2">That with such perfumes fill the breeze,</l>
<l rend="i2">As Peris to their Sister bear,</l>
<l rend="i0">When from the summit of some lofty tree</l>
<l rend="i0">She hangs encaged, the captive of the Dives.</l>
<l rend="i4">They from their pinions shake</l>
<l rend="i2">The sweetness of celestial flowers,</l>
<l rend="i2">And as her enemies impure</l>
<l rend="i0">From that impervious poison far away</l>
<l rend="i0">Fly groaning with the torment, she the while</l>
<l rend="i4">Inhales her fragrant<ptr target="#FNanchor_119_119"/> food.</l>
<l rend="i2">Such odours flowed upon the world</l>
<l rend="i2">When at Mohammed's nuptials, word</l>
<l rend="i4">Went forth in Heaven to roll</l>
<l rend="i0">The everlasting gates of Paradise</l>
<l rend="i0">Back on their living hinges, that its gales</l>
<l rend="i0">Might visit all below; the general bliss</l>
<l rend="i0">Thrilled every bosom, and the family</l>
<l rend="i0">Of man, for once<ptr target="#FNanchor_120_120"/> partook one common joy.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Full of the joy, yet still awake</l>
<l rend="i2">To wonder, on went Thalaba;</l>
<l rend="i2">On every side the song of mirth,</l>
<l rend="i2">The music of festivity,</l>
<l rend="i4">Invite the passing youth.</l>
<l rend="i0">Wearied at length with hunger and with heat</l>
<l rend="i2">He enters in a banquet room,</l>
<l rend="i4">Where round a fountain brink,</l>
<l rend="i0">On silken<ptr target="#FNanchor_121_121"/> carpets sate the festive train.</l>
<l rend="i4">Instant thro' all his frame</l>
<l rend="i4">Delightful coolness spread;</l>
<l rend="i4">The playing fount refreshed</l>
<l rend="i4">The agitated air;</l>
<l rend="i0">The very light came cooled thro' silvering panes</l>
<l rend="i0">Of pearly<ptr target="#FNanchor_122_122"/> shell, like the pale moon-beam tinged;</l>
<l rend="i0">Or where the wine-vase<ptr target="#FNanchor_123_123"/> filled the aperture,</l>
<l rend="i0">Rosy as rising morn, or softer gleam</l>
<l rend="i0">Of saffron, like the sunny evening mist:</l>
<l rend="i2">Thro' every hue, and streaked by all</l>
<l rend="i4">The flowing fountain played.</l>
<l rend="i4">Around the water-edge</l>
<l rend="i2">Vessels of wine, alternate placed,</l>
<l rend="i0">Ruby and amber, tinged its little waves.</l>
<l rend="i4">From golden goblets there<ptr target="#FNanchor_124_124"/></l>
<l rend="i0">The guests sate quaffing the delicious juice</l>
<l rend="i4">Of Shiraz' golden grape.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">But Thalaba took not the draught</l>
<l rend="i0">For rightly he knew had the Prophet forbidden</l>
<l rend="i2">That beverage the mother<ptr target="#FNanchor_125_125"/> of sins.</l>
<l rend="i4">Nor did the urgent guests</l>
<l rend="i0">Proffer a second time the liquid fire</l>
<l rend="i2">For in the youth's strong eye they saw</l>
<l rend="i4">No moveable resolve.</l>
<l rend="i2">Yet not uncourteous, Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i2">Drank the cool draught of innocence,</l>
<l rend="i2">That fragrant from its dewy<ptr target="#FNanchor_126_126"/> vase</l>
<l rend="i0">Came purer than it left its native bed.</l>
<l rend="i2">And he partook the odorous fruits,</l>
<l rend="i4">For all rich fruits were there.</l>
<l rend="i4">Water-melons rough of rind,</l>
<l rend="i4">Whose pulp the thirsty lip</l>
<l rend="i4">Dissolved into a draught:</l>
<l rend="i0">Pistachios from the heavy-clustered trees</l>
<l rend="i0">Of Malavert, or Haleb's fertile soil,</l>
<l rend="i0">And Casbin's<ptr target="#FNanchor_127_127"/> luscious grapes of amber hue,</l>
<l rend="i4">That many a week endure</l>
<l rend="i4">The summer sun intense,</l>
<l rend="i4">Till by its powerful fire</l>
<l rend="i0">All watery particles exhaled, alone</l>
<l rend="i0">The strong essential sweetness ripens there.</l>
<l rend="i2">Here cased in ice, the <ptr target="#FNanchor_128_128"/>apricot,</l>
<l rend="i4">A topaz, crystal-set:</l>
<l rend="i4">Here on a plate of snow</l>
<l rend="i4">The sunny orange rests,</l>
<l rend="i0">And still the aloes and the sandal-wood</l>
<l rend="i0">From golden censers o'er the banquet room</l>
<l rend="i4">Diffuse their dying sweets.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Anon a troop of females formed the dance</l>
<l rend="i2">Their ancles bound with <ptr target="#FNanchor_129_129"/>bracelet-bells</l>
<l rend="i0">That made the modulating harmony.</l>
<l rend="i0">Transparent<ptr target="#FNanchor_130_130"/> garments to the greedy eye</l>
<l rend="i4">Gave all their harlot limbs,</l>
<l rend="i0">That writhed, in each immodest gesture skilled.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">With earnest eyes the banqueters</l>
<l rend="i4">Fed on the sight impure;</l>
<l rend="i4">And Thalaba, he gazed,</l>
<l rend="i0">But in his heart he bore a talisman</l>
<l rend="i4">Whose blessed Alchemy</l>
<l rend="i4">To virtuous thoughts refined</l>
<l rend="i0">The loose suggestions of the scene impure.</l>
<l rend="i0">Oneiza's image swam before his sight,</l>
<l rend="i4">His own Arabian Maid.</l>
<l rend="i0">He rose, and from the banquet room he rushed,</l>
<l rend="i2">And tears ran down his burning cheek,</l>
<l rend="i0">And nature for a moment woke the thought</l>
<l rend="i0">And murmured, that from all domestic joys</l>
<l rend="i2">Estranged, he wandered o'er the world</l>
<l rend="i0">A lonely being, far from all he loved.</l>
<l rend="i0">Son of Hodeirah, not among thy crimes</l>
<l rend="i2">That murmur shall be written!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">From tents of revelry,</l>
<l rend="i0">From festal bowers, to solitude he ran,</l>
<l rend="i2">And now he reached where all the rills</l>
<l rend="i0">Of that well-watered garden in one tide</l>
<l rend="i4">Rolled their collected waves.</l>
<l rend="i4">A straight and stately bridge</l>
<l rend="i0">Stretched its long arches o'er the ample stream.</l>
<l rend="i0">Strong in the evening and distinct its shade</l>
<l rend="i0">Lay on the watry mirror, and his eye</l>
<l rend="i0">Saw it united with its parent pile</l>
<l rend="i0">One huge fantastic fabric. Drawing near,</l>
<l rend="i0">Loud from the chambers<ptr target="#FNanchor_131_131"/> of the bridge below,</l>
<l rend="i2">Sounds of carousal came and song,</l>
<l rend="i0">And unveiled women bade the advancing youth</l>
<l rend="i4">Come merry-make with them.</l>
<l rend="i0">Unhearing or unheeding, Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i4">Past o'er with hurried pace,</l>
<l rend="i0">And plunged amid the forest solitude.</l>
<l rend="i4">Deserts of Araby!</l>
<l rend="i4">His soul returned to you.</l>
<l rend="i2">He cast himself upon the earth</l>
<l rend="i4">And closed his eyes, and called</l>
<l rend="i2">The voluntary vision up.</l>
<l rend="i4">A cry as of distress</l>
<l rend="i2">Aroused him; loud it came, and near!</l>
<l rend="i2">He started up, he strung his bow,</l>
<l rend="i4">He plucked the arrow forth.</l>
<l rend="i2">Again a shriek ... a woman's shriek!</l>
<l rend="i2">And lo! she rushes thro' the trees,</l>
<l rend="i2">Her veil all rent, her garments torn!</l>
<l rend="i2">He follows close, the ravisher....</l>
<l rend="i4">Even on the unechoing grass</l>
<l rend="i4">She hears his tread, so close!</l>
<l rend="i2">"Prophet save me! save me God!</l>
<l rend="i2">"Help! help!" she cried to Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i4">Thalaba drew the bow.</l>
<l rend="i0">The unerring arrow did its work of death.</l>
<l rend="i0">He turned him to the woman, and beheld</l>
<l rend="i0">His own Oneiza, his Arabian Maid.</l></lg>
</div>

<div type="book"><head>THE SEVENTH BOOK.</head><lg>
<l rend="i4">From fear, amazement, joy,</l>
<l rend="i0">At length the Arabian Maid recovering speech,</l>
<l rend="i0">Threw around Thalaba her arms and cried,</l>
<l rend="i0">"My father! O my father!" Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i0">In wonder lost, yet fearful to enquire,</l>
<l rend="i4">Bent down his cheek on hers,</l>
<l rend="i2">And their tears mingled as they fell.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">ONEIZA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">At night they seized me, Thalaba! in my sleep,...</l>
<l rend="i0">Thou wert not near,... and yet when in their grasp</l>
<l rend="i0">I woke, my shriek of terror called on thee.</l>
<l rend="i0">My father could not save me,... an old man!</l>
<l rend="i0">And they were strong and many,... O my God,</l>
<l rend="i0">The hearts they must have had to hear his prayers,</l>
<l rend="i0">And yet to leave him childless!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i12">We will seek him.</l><l rend="i0">We will return to Araby.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">ONEIZA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i10">Alas!</l><l rend="i0">We should not find him, Thalaba! our tent</l>
<l rend="i0">Is desolate, the wind hath heaped the sands</l>
<l rend="i0">Within its door, the lizard's<ptr target="#FNanchor_132_132"/> track is left</l>
<l rend="i0">Fresh on the untrodden dust; prowling by night</l>
<l rend="i0">The tyger, as he passes hears no breath</l>
<l rend="i0">Of man, and turns to search its solitude.</l>
<l rend="i0">Alas! he strays a wretched wanderer</l>
<l rend="i0">Seeking his child! old man, he will not rest,...</l>
<l rend="i0">He cannot rest, his sleep is misery,</l>
<l rend="i0">His dreams are of my wretchedness, my wrongs....</l>
<l rend="i0">O Thalaba! this is a wicked place!</l>
<l rend="i0">Let us be gone!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i6">But how to pass again</l>
<l rend="i0">The iron doors that opening at a breath</l>
<l rend="i0">Gave easy entrance? armies in their strength,</l>
<l rend="i0">Would fail to move those hinges for return!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">ONEIZA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">But we can climb the mountains that shut in</l>
<l rend="i0">This dreadful garden.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">Are Oneiza's limbs</l>
<l rend="i0">Equal to that long toil?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">ONEIZA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">   Oh I am strong</l>
<l rend="i0">Dear Thalaba! for this ... fear gives me force,</l>
<l rend="i0">And you are with me!</l>
<l rend="i8">So she took his hand,</l>
<l rend="i0">And gently drew him forward, and they went</l>
<l rend="i4">Towards the mountain chain.</l>
<l rend="i0">It was broad moonlight, and obscure or lost</l>
<l rend="i4">The garden beauties lay,</l>
<l rend="i0">But the great boundary rose, distinctly marked.</l>
<l rend="i4">These were no little hills,</l>
<l rend="i0">No sloping uplands lifting to the sun</l>
<l rend="i0">Their vine-yards, with fresh verdure, and the shade</l>
<l rend="i0">Of ancient woods, courting the loiterer</l>
<l rend="i0">To win the easy ascent: stone mountains these</l>
<l rend="i4">Desolate rock on rock,</l>
<l rend="i4">The burthens of the earth,</l>
<l rend="i0">Whose snowy summits met the morning beam</l>
<l rend="i0">When night was in the vale, whose feet were fixed</l>
<l rend="i0">In the world's<ptr target="#FNanchor_133_133"/> foundations. Thalaba surveyed</l>
<l rend="i4">The heights precipitous,</l>
<l rend="i0">Impending crags, rocks unascendible,</l>
<l rend="i0">And summits that had tired the eagle's wing;</l>
<l rend="i4">"There is no way!" he cried.</l>
<l rend="i4">Paler Oneiza grew</l>
<l rend="i0">And hung upon his arm a feebler weight.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">But soon again to hope</l>
<l rend="i4">Revives the Arabian maid,</l>
<l rend="i0">As Thalaba imparts the sudden thought.</l>
<l rend="i2">"I past a river," cried the youth</l>
<l rend="i4">"A full and copious stream.</l>
<l rend="i0">"The flowing waters cannot be restrained</l>
<l rend="i2">"And where they find or force their way,</l>
<l rend="i0">"There we perchance may follow, thitherward</l>
<l rend="i4">"The current rolled along."</l>
<l rend="i2">So saying yet again in hope</l>
<l rend="i4">Quickening their eager steps</l>
<l rend="i4">They turned them thitherward.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Silent and calm the river rolled along,</l>
<l rend="i4">And at the verge arrived</l>
<l rend="i0">Of that fair garden, o'er a rocky bed</l>
<l rend="i4">Towards the mountain base,</l>
<l rend="i0">Still full and silent, held its even way,</l>
<l rend="i4">But the deep sound, the dash</l>
<l rend="i0">Louder and louder in the distance rose,</l>
<l rend="i4">As if it forced its stream</l>
<l rend="i0">Struggling with crags along a narrow pass.</l>
<l rend="i0">And lo! where raving o'er a hollow course</l>
<l rend="i4">The ever-flowing tide</l>
<l rend="i0">Foams in a thousand whirlpools! there adown</l>
<l rend="i4">The perforated rock</l>
<l rend="i0">Plunge the whole waters, so precipitous,</l>
<l rend="i4">So fathomless a fall</l>
<l rend="i0">That their earth-shaking roar came deadened up</l>
<l rend="i0">Like subterranean thunders.</l>
<l rend="i10">  "Allah save us!"</l><l rend="i0">Oneiza cried, "there is no path for man</l>
<l rend="i4">"From this accursed place!"</l>
<l rend="i4">And as she spake her joints</l>
<l rend="i0">Were loosened, and her knees sunk under her.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Cheer up, Oneiza!" Thalaba replied,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Be of good heart. We cannot fly</l>
<l rend="i4">"The dangers of the place,</l>
<l rend="i4">"But we can conquer them!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">And the young Arab's soul</l>
<l rend="i0">Arose within him; "what is he," he cried,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Who has prepared this garden of delight,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And wherefore are its snares?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The Arabian Maid replied,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The Women when I entered, welcomed me</l>
<l rend="i0">"To Paradise, by Aloadin's will</l>
<l rend="i0">"Chosen like themselves, a Houri of the Earth.</l>
<l rend="i0">"They told me, credulous of his blasphemies,</l>
<l rend="i0">"That Aloadin placed them to reward</l>
<l rend="i0">"His faithful servants with the joys of Heaven.</l>
<l rend="i0">"O Thalaba, and all are ready here</l>
<l rend="i0">"To wreak his wicked will, and work all crimes!</l>
<l rend="i4">"How then shall we escape?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Woe to him!" cried the Appointed, a stern smile</l>
<l rend="i0">Darkening with stronger shades his countenance,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Woe to him! he hath laid his toils</l>
<l rend="i4">"To take the Antelope,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Lion is come in!"</l>
<l rend="i2">She shook her head, "a Sorcerer he</l>
<l rend="i0">"And guarded by so many! Thalaba,...</l>
<l rend="i0">"And thou but one!"</l>
<l rend="i8">He raised his hand to Heaven,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Is there not God, Oneiza?</l>
<l rend="i0">"I have a Talisman, that, whoso bears,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Him, nor the Earthly, nor the Infernal Powers</l>
<l rend="i4">"Of Evil can cast down.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Remember Destiny</l>
<l rend="i4">"Hath marked me from mankind!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Now rest in faith, and I will guard thy sleep!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">So on a violet bank</l>
<l rend="i4">The Arabian Maid lay down,</l>
<l rend="i0">Her soft cheek pillowed upon moss and flowers.</l>
<l rend="i4">She lay in silent prayer,</l>
<l rend="i2">Till prayer had tranquillized her fears,</l>
<l rend="i2">And sleep fell on her. By her side</l>
<l rend="i4">Silent sate Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i4">And gazed upon the Maid,</l>
<l rend="i4">And as he gazed, drew in</l>
<l rend="i2">New courage and intenser faith,</l>
<l rend="i0">And waited calmly for the eventful day.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Loud sung the Lark, the awakened Maid</l>
<l rend="i0">Beheld him twinkling in the morning light,</l>
<l rend="i0">And wished for wings and liberty like his.</l>
<l rend="i2">The flush of fear inflamed her cheek,</l>
<l rend="i2">But Thalaba was calm of soul,</l>
<l rend="i4">Collected for the work.</l>
<l rend="i4">He pondered in his mind</l>
<l rend="i4">How from Lobaba's breast</l>
<l rend="i4">His blunted arrow fell.</l>
<l rend="i4">Aloadin too might wear</l>
<l rend="i4">Spell perchance of equal power</l>
<l rend="i4">To blunt the weapon's edge!</l>
<l rend="i4">Beside the river-brink,</l>
<l rend="i0">Rose a young poplar, whose unsteady leaves</l>
<l rend="i2">Varying their verdure to the gale,</l>
<l rend="i4">With silver glitter caught</l>
<l rend="i4">His meditating eye.</l>
<l rend="i2">Then to Oneiza turned the youth</l>
<l rend="i4">And gave his father's bow,</l>
<l rend="i4">And o'er her shoulders slung</l>
<l rend="i4">The quiver arrow-stored.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Me other weapon suits;" said he,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Bear thou the Bow: dear Maid!</l>
<l rend="i0">"The days return upon me, when these shafts,</l>
<l rend="i0">"True to thy guidance, from the lofty palm</l>
<l rend="i0">"Brought down the cluster, and thy gladdened eye</l>
<l rend="i0">"Exulting turned to seek the voice of praise.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Oh! yet again Oneiza, we shall share</l>
<l rend="i0">"Our desert joys!"</l>
<l rend="i6">  So saying to the bank</l>
<l rend="i4">He moved, and stooping low,</l>
<l rend="i0">With double grasp, hand below hand, he clenched</l>
<l rend="i4">And from its watry soil</l>
<l rend="i4">Uptore the poplar trunk.</l>
<l rend="i2">Then off he shook the clotted earth,</l>
<l rend="i4">And broke away the head</l>
<l rend="i4">And boughs and lesser roots,</l>
<l rend="i4">And lifting it aloft</l>
<l rend="i0">Wielded with able sway the massy club.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Now for this child of Hell!" quoth Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Belike he shall exchange to day</l>
<l rend="i4">"His dainty Paradise</l>
<l rend="i2">"For other dwelling, and the fruit</l>
<l rend="i4">"Of Zaccoum,<ptr target="#FNanchor_134_134"/> cursed tree."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">With that the youth and Arab maid</l>
<l rend="i2">Towards the garden centre past.</l>
<l rend="i0">It chanced that Aloadin had convoked</l>
<l rend="i4">The garden-habitants,</l>
<l rend="i4">And with the assembled throng</l>
<l rend="i0">Oneiza mingled, and the appointed youth.</l>
<l rend="i2">Unmarked they mingled, or if one</l>
<l rend="i0">With busier finger to his neighbour notes</l>
<l rend="i2">The quivered Maid, "haply," he says,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Some daughter of the<ptr target="#FNanchor_135_135"/> Homerites,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Or one who yet remembers with delight</l>
<l rend="i0">"Her native tents of Himiar!" "Nay!" rejoins</l>
<l rend="i0">His comrade, "a love-pageant! for the man</l>
<l rend="i0">"Mimics with that fierce eye and knotty club</l>
<l rend="i0">"Some savage lion-tamer, she forsooth</l>
<l rend="i0">"Must play the heroine of the years of old!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Radiant with gems upon his throne of gold</l>
<l rend="i4">Aloadin sate.</l>
<l rend="i4">O'er the Sorcerer's head</l>
<l rend="i0">Hovered a Bird, and in the fragrant air</l>
<l rend="i4">Waved his winnowing wings,</l>
<l rend="i4">A living canopy.</l>
<l rend="i2">Large as the plumeless Cassowar</l>
<l rend="i4">Was that o'ershadowing Bird;</l>
<l rend="i2">So huge his talons, in their grasp</l>
<l rend="i0">The Eagle would have hung a helpless prey.</l>
<l rend="i2">His beak was iron, and his plumes</l>
<l rend="i4">Glittered like burnished gold,</l>
<l rend="i0">And his eyes glowed, as tho' an inward fire</l>
<l rend="i4">Shone thro' a diamond orb.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The blinded multitude</l>
<l rend="i4">Adored the Sorcerer,</l>
<l rend="i2">And bent the knee before him,</l>
<l rend="i4">And shouted out his praise,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Mighty art thou, the Bestower of joy,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Lord of Paradise!"</l>
<l rend="i4">Aloadin waved his hand,</l>
<l rend="i2">In idolizing reverence</l>
<l rend="i4">Moveless they stood and mute.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Children of Earth," he cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Whom I have guided here</l>
<l rend="i0">"By easier passage than the gate of Death,</l>
<l rend="i2">"The infidel Sultan to whose lands</l>
<l rend="i4">"My mountains reach their roots,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Blasphemes and threatens me.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Strong are his armies, many are his guards,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Yet may a dagger find him.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Children of Earth, I tempt you not</l>
<l rend="i0">"With the vain promise of a bliss unseen,</l>
<l rend="i2">"With tales of a hereafter Heaven</l>
<l rend="i2">"Whence never Traveller hath returned!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Have ye not tasted of the cup of joy,</l>
<l rend="i2">"That in these groves of happiness</l>
<l rend="i2">"For ever over-mantling tempts</l>
<l rend="i4">"The ever-thirsty lip?</l>
<l rend="i2">"Who is there here that by a deed</l>
<l rend="i4">"Of danger will deserve</l>
<l rend="i0">"The eternal joys of actual Paradise?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"I!" Thalaba exclaimed,</l>
<l rend="i0">And springing forward, on the Sorcerer's head</l>
<l rend="i4">He dashed the knotty club.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">He fell not, tho' the force</l>
<l rend="i2">Shattered his skull; nor flowed the blood.</l>
<l rend="i2">For by some hellish talisman</l>
<l rend="i4">His life imprisoned still</l>
<l rend="i0">Dwelt in the body. The astonished crowd</l>
<l rend="i2">Stand motionless with fear, and wait</l>
<l rend="i0">Immediate vengeance from the wrath of Heaven.</l>
<l rend="i2">And lo! the Bird ... the monster Bird</l>
<l rend="i4">Soars up ... then pounces down</l>
<l rend="i4">To seize on Thalaba!</l>
<l rend="i4">Now Oneiza, bend the bow,</l>
<l rend="i4">Now draw the arrow home!</l>
<l rend="i0">It fled, the arrow from Oneiza's hand,</l>
<l rend="i4">It pierced the monster Bird,</l>
<l rend="i4">It broke the Talisman.</l>
<l rend="i4">Then darkness covered all,...</l>
<l rend="i0">Earth shook, Heaven thundered, and amid the yells</l>
<l rend="i4">Of Spirits accursed, destroyed</l>
<l rend="i4">The Paradise<ptr target="#FNanchor_136_136"/> of Sin.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">At last the earth was still;</l>
<l rend="i2">The yelling of the Demons ceased;</l>
<l rend="i0">Opening the wreck and ruin to their sight</l>
<l rend="i0">The darkness rolled away. Alone in life</l>
<l rend="i0">Amid the desolation and the dead</l>
<l rend="i0">Stood the Destroyer and the Arabian Maid.</l>
<l rend="i2">They looked around, the rocks were rent,</l>
<l rend="i0">The path was open, late by magic closed.</l>
<l rend="i0">Awe-struck and silent down the stony glen</l>
<l rend="i4">They wound their thoughtful way.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Amid the vale below</l>
<l rend="i4">Tents rose, and streamers played</l>
<l rend="i2">And javelins sparkled in the sun,</l>
<l rend="i4">And multitudes encamped</l>
<l rend="i0">Swarmed, far as eye could follow, o'er the plain.</l>
<l rend="i2">There in his war pavilion sate</l>
<l rend="i4">In council with his Chiefs</l>
<l rend="i4">The Sultan of the Land.</l>
<l rend="i0">Before his presence there a Captain led</l>
<l rend="i2">Oneiza and the appointed Youth.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Obedient to our Lord's command," said he,</l>
<l rend="i0">"We past towards the mountains, and began</l>
<l rend="i0">"The ascending strait; when suddenly Earth shook,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And darkness like the midnight fell around,</l>
<l rend="i2">"And fire and thunder came from Heaven</l>
<l rend="i0">"As tho' the Retribution day were come.</l>
<l rend="i0">"After the terror ceased, and when with hearts</l>
<l rend="i0">"Somewhat assured, again we ventured on,</l>
<l rend="i0">"This youth and woman met us on the way.</l>
<l rend="i0">"They told us that from Aloadin's haunt</l>
<l rend="i0">"They came on whom the judgement-stroke has fallen;</l>
<l rend="i0">"He and his sinful Paradise at once</l>
<l rend="i0">"Destroyed by them, the agents they of Heaven.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Therefore I brought them hither, to repeat</l>
<l rend="i0">"The tale before thy presence; that as search</l>
<l rend="i0">"Shall prove it false or faithful, to their merit</l>
<l rend="i0">"Thou mayest reward them."</l>
<l rend="i11">"Be it done to us,"</l><l rend="i0">Thalaba answered, "as the truth shall prove!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The Sultan while he spake</l>
<l rend="i0">"Fixed on him the proud eye of sovereignty;</l>
<l rend="i4">"If thou hast played with us,</l>
<l rend="i0">"By Allah and by Ali, Death shall seal</l>
<l rend="i0">"The lying lips for ever! if the thing</l>
<l rend="i0">"Be as thou sayest it, Arab, thou shalt stand</l>
<l rend="i2">"Next to ourself!"...</l>
<l rend="i10">And hark! the cry</l><l rend="i2">The lengthening cry, the increasing shout</l>
<l rend="i4">Of joyful multitudes!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Breathless and panting to the tent</l>
<l rend="i2">The bearer of good tidings comes,</l>
<l rend="i0">"O Sultan, live for ever! be thy foes</l>
<l rend="i4">"Like Aloadin all!</l>
<l rend="i2">"The wrath of God hath smitten him."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Joy at the welcome tale</l>
<l rend="i4">Shone in the Sultan's cheek</l>
<l rend="i2">"Array the Arab in the robe</l>
<l rend="i4">"Of honour," he exclaimed,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And place a chain of gold around his neck,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And bind around his brow the diadem,</l>
<l rend="i2">"And mount him on my steed of state,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And lead him thro' the camp,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And let the Heralds go before and cry</l>
<l rend="i4">"Thus shall the Sultan reward</l>
<l rend="i4">"The man<ptr target="#FNanchor_137_137"/> who serves him well!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Then in the purple robe</l>
<l rend="i4">They vested Thalaba.</l>
<l rend="i0">And hung around his neck the golden chain,</l>
<l rend="i0">And bound his forehead with the diadem,</l>
<l rend="i4">And on the royal steed</l>
<l rend="i4">They led him thro' the camp,</l>
<l rend="i2">And Heralds went before and cried</l>
<l rend="i4">"Thus shall the Sultan reward</l>
<l rend="i4">"The man who serves him well!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">When from the pomp of triumph</l>
<l rend="i4">And presence of the King</l>
<l rend="i0">Thalaba sought the tent allotted him,</l>
<l rend="i2">Thoughtful the Arabian Maid beheld</l>
<l rend="i4">His animated eye,</l>
<l rend="i4">His cheek inflamed with pride.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Oneiza!" cried the youth,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The King hath done according to his word,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And made me in the land</l>
<l rend="i4">"Next to himself be named!...</l>
<l rend="i0">"But why that serious melancholy smile?</l>
<l rend="i0">"Oneiza when I heard the voice that gave me</l>
<l rend="i0">"Honour, and wealth, and fame, the instant thought</l>
<l rend="i0">"Arose to fill my joy, that thou wouldest hear</l>
<l rend="i0">"The tidings, and be happy."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">ONEIZA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i11">Thalaba</l><l rend="i0">Thou wouldest not have me mirthful! am I not</l>
<l rend="i0">An orphan,... among strangers?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i12">But with me.</l></lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">ONEIZA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">My Father,...</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i6">Nay be comforted! last night</l>
<l rend="i0">To what wert thou exposed! in what a peril</l>
<l rend="i0">The morning found us! safety, honour, wealth</l>
<l rend="i0">These now are ours. This instant who thou wert</l>
<l rend="i0">The Sultan asked. I told him from our childhood</l>
<l rend="i0">We had been plighted;... was I wrong Oneiza?</l>
<l rend="i0">And when he said with bounties he would heap</l>
<l rend="i0">Our nuptials,... wilt thou blame me if I blest</l>
<l rend="i0">His will, that bade me fix the marriage day!</l>
<l rend="i0">In tears Oneiza?...</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">ONEIZA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Remember Destiny</l>
<l rend="i4">Hath marked thee from mankind!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Perhaps when Aloadin was destroyed</l>
<l rend="i0">The mission ceased, else would wise Providence</l>
<l rend="i0">With its rewards and blessings strew my path</l>
<l rend="i0">Thus for accomplished service?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">ONEIZA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i12">Thalaba!</l></lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Or if haply not, yet whither should I go?</l>
<l rend="i0">Is it not prudent to abide in peace</l>
<l rend="i0">Till I am summoned?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">ONEIZA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">Take me to the Deserts!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">But Moath is not there; and wouldest thou dwell</l>
<l rend="i0">In a Stranger's tent? thy father then might seek</l>
<l rend="i0">In long and fruitless wandering for his child.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">ONEIZA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Take me then to Mecca!</l>
<l rend="i0">There let me dwell a servant of the Temple.</l>
<l rend="i0">Bind thou thyself my veil,... to human eye</l>
<l rend="i0">It never shall be lifted. There, whilst thou</l>
<l rend="i0">Shalt go upon thine enterprize, my prayers,</l>
<l rend="i0">Dear Thalaba! shall rise to succour thee,</l>
<l rend="i0">And I shall live,... if not in happiness;</l>
<l rend="i0">Surely in hope.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i6">Oh think of better things!</l>
<l rend="i0">The will of Heaven is plain: by wonderous ways</l>
<l rend="i0">It led us here, and soon the common voice</l>
<l rend="i0">Shall tell what we have done, and how we dwell</l>
<l rend="i0">Under the shadow of the Sultan's wing,</l>
<l rend="i0">So shall thy father hear the fame, and find us</l>
<l rend="i0">What he hath wished us ever.... Still in tears!</l>
<l rend="i0">Still that unwilling eye! nay ... nay.... Oneiza....</l>
<l rend="i0">Has then another since I left the tent....</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">ONEIZA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Thalaba! Thalaba!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">With song, with music, and with dance</l>
<l rend="i4">The bridal pomp proceeds.</l>
<l rend="i4">Following on the veiled Bride</l>
<l rend="i4">Fifty female slaves attend</l>
<l rend="i4">In costly robes that gleam</l>
<l rend="i4">With interwoven gold,</l>
<l rend="i4">And sparkle far with gems.</l>
<l rend="i2">An hundred slaves behind them bear</l>
<l rend="i2">Vessels of silver and vessels of gold</l>
<l rend="i2">And many a gorgeous garment gay</l>
<l rend="i2">The presents that the Sultan gave.</l>
<l rend="i2">On either hand the pages go</l>
<l rend="i2">With torches flaring thro' the gloom,</l>
<l rend="i2">And trump and timbrel merriment</l>
<l rend="i4">Accompanies their way;</l>
<l rend="i2">And multitudes with loud acclaim</l>
<l rend="i4">Shout blessings on the Bride.</l>
<l rend="i2">And now they reach the palace pile,</l>
<l rend="i2">The palace home of Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i2">And now the marriage feast is spread</l>
<l rend="i2">And from the finished banquet now</l>
<l rend="i4">The wedding guests are gone.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Who comes from the bridal chamber?</l>
<l rend="i2">It is Azrael, the Angel of Death.</l></lg>

<l rend="i0">Go not among the Tombs, Old Man!</l>
<l rend="i0">There is a madman there.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">OLD MAN.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Will he harm me if I go?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">WOMAN.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Not he, poor miserable man!</l>
<l rend="i0">But 'tis a wretched sight to see</l>
<l rend="i0">His utter wretchedness.</l>
<l rend="i0">For all day long he lies on a grave,</l>
<l rend="i0">And never is he seen to weep,</l>
<l rend="i0">And never is he heard to groan.</l>
<l rend="i0">Nor ever at the hour of prayer</l>
<l rend="i0">Bends his knee, nor moves his lips.</l>
<l rend="i0">I have taken him food for charity</l>
<l rend="i0">And never a word he spake,</l>
<l rend="i0">But yet so ghastly he looked</l>
<l rend="i0">That I have awakened at night</l>
<l rend="i0">With the dream of his ghastly eyes.</l>
<l rend="i0">Now go not among the Tombs, Old Man!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">OLD MAN.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Wherefore has the wrath of God</l>
<l rend="i0">So sorely stricken him?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">WOMAN.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">He came a Stranger to the land,</l>
<l rend="i0">And did good service to the Sultan,</l>
<l rend="i0">And well his service was rewarded.</l>
<l rend="i0">The Sultan named him next himself,</l>
<l rend="i0">And gave a palace for his dwelling,</l>
<l rend="i0">And dowered his bride with rich domains.</l>
<l rend="i0">But on his wedding night</l>
<l rend="i0">There came the Angel of Death.</l>
<l rend="i0">Since that hour a man distracted</l>
<l rend="i0">Among the sepulchres he wanders.</l>
<l rend="i0">The Sultan when he heard the tale</l>
<l rend="i0">Said that for some untold crime</l>
<l rend="i0">Judgement thus had stricken him,</l>
<l rend="i0">And asking Heaven forgiveness</l>
<l rend="i0">That he had shewn him favour,</l>
<l rend="i0">Abandoned him to want.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">OLD MAN.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">A Stranger did you say?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">WOMAN.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">An Arab born, like you.</l>
<l rend="i0">But go not among the Tombs,</l>
<l rend="i0">For the sight of his wretchedness</l>
<l rend="i0">Might make a hard heart ache!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">OLD MAN.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Nay, nay, I never yet have shunned</l>
<l rend="i0">A countryman in distress:</l>
<l rend="i0">And the sound of his dear native tongue</l>
<l rend="i0">May be like the voice of a friend.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Then to the Sepulchre</l>
<l rend="i2">The Woman pointed out,</l>
<l rend="i2">Old Moath bent his way.</l>
<l rend="i2">By the tomb lay Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i2">In the light of the setting eve.</l>
<l rend="i2">The sun, and the wind, and the rain</l>
<l rend="i2">Had rusted his raven locks,</l>
<l rend="i2">His checks were fallen in,</l>
<l rend="i2">His face bones prominent,</l>
<l rend="i2">By the tomb he lay along</l>
<l rend="i2">And his lean fingers played,</l>
<l rend="i0">Unwitting, with the grass that grew beside.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The Old man knew him not,</l>
<l rend="i4">And drawing near him cried</l>
<l rend="i4">"Countryman, peace be with thee!"</l>
<l rend="i2">The sound of his dear native tongue</l>
<l rend="i4">Awakened Thalaba.</l>
<l rend="i4">He raised his countenance</l>
<l rend="i4">And saw the good Old Man,</l>
<l rend="i0">And he arose, and fell upon his neck,</l>
<l rend="i4">And groaned in bitterness.</l>
<l rend="i4">Then Moath knew the youth,</l>
<l rend="i0">And feared that he was childless, and he turned</l>
<l rend="i2">His eyes, and pointed to the tomb.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Old Man!" cried Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Thy search is ended there!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The father's cheek grew white</l>
<l rend="i0">And his lip quivered with the misery;</l>
<l rend="i0">Howbeit, collecting with a painful voice</l>
<l rend="i0">He answered, "God is good! his will be done!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The woe in which he spake,</l>
<l rend="i0">The resignation that inspired his speech,</l>
<l rend="i4">They softened Thalaba.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Thou hast a solace in thy grief," he cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"A comforter within!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Moath! thou seest me here,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Delivered to the Evil Powers,</l>
<l rend="i4">"A God-abandoned wretch."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">The Old Man looked at him incredulous.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Nightly," the youth pursued,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Thy daughter comes to drive me to despair.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Moath thou thinkest me mad,...</l>
<l rend="i0">"But when the Cryer<ptr target="#FNanchor_138_138"/> from the Minaret</l>
<l rend="i4">"Proclaims the midnight hour,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Hast thou a heart to see her?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">In the<ptr target="#FNanchor_139_139"/> Meidan now</l>
<l rend="i2">The clang of clarions and of drums</l>
<l rend="i2">Accompanied the Sun's descent.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Dost thou not pray? my son!"</l>
<l rend="i4">Said Moath, as he saw</l>
<l rend="i0">The white flag waving on the neighbouring Mosque;</l>
<l rend="i4">Then Thalaba's eye grew wild,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Pray!" echoed he, "I must not pray!"</l>
<l rend="i4">And the hollow groan he gave</l>
<l rend="i4">Went to the Old Man's heart,</l>
<l rend="i2">And bowing down his face to earth,</l>
<l rend="i0">In fervent agony he called on God.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">A night of darkness and of storms!</l>
<l rend="i2">Into the Chamber<ptr target="#FNanchor_140_140"/> of the Tomb</l>
<l rend="i4">Thalaba led the Old Man,</l>
<l rend="i4">To roof him from the rain.</l>
<l rend="i4">A night of storms! the wind</l>
<l rend="i4">Swept thro' the moonless sky</l>
<l rend="i0">And moaned among the pillared sepulchres.</l>
<l rend="i2">And in the pauses of its sweep</l>
<l rend="i4">They heard the heavy rain</l>
<l rend="i2">Beat on the monument above.</l>
<l rend="i2">In silence on Oneiza's grave</l>
<l rend="i2">The Father and the Husband sate.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">The Cryer from the Minaret</l>
<l rend="i4">Proclaimed the midnight hour;</l>
<l rend="i4">"Now! now!" cried Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i2">And o'er the chamber of the tomb</l>
<l rend="i4">There spread a lurid gleam</l>
<l rend="i0">Like the reflection of a sulphur fire,</l>
<l rend="i4">And in that hideous light</l>
<l rend="i0">Oneiza stood before them, it was She,</l>
<l rend="i0">Her very lineaments, and such as death</l>
<l rend="i0">Had changed them, livid cheeks, and lips of blue.</l>
<l rend="i4">But in her eyes there dwelt</l>
<l rend="i4">Brightness more terrible</l>
<l rend="i2">Than all the loathsomeness of death.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Still art thou living, wretch?"</l>
<l rend="i0">In hollow tones she cried to Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i2">"And must I nightly leave my grave</l>
<l rend="i4">"To tell thee, still in vain,</l>
<l rend="i4">"God has abandoned thee?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"This is not she!" the Old Man exclaimed,</l>
<l rend="i4">"A Fiend! a manifest Fiend!"</l>
<l rend="i2">And to the youth he held his lance,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Strike and deliver thyself!"</l>
<l rend="i4">"Strike <hi rend="smallcap">her</hi>!" cried Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i4">And palsied of all powers</l>
<l rend="i0">Gazed fixedly upon the dreadful form.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Yea! strike her!" cried a voice whose tones</l>
<l rend="i0">Flowed with such sudden healing thro' his soul,</l>
<l rend="i4">As when the desert shower</l>
<l rend="i4">From death delivered him.</l>
<l rend="i0">But unobedient to that well-known voice</l>
<l rend="i4">His eye was seeking it,</l>
<l rend="i4">When Moath firm of heart,</l>
<l rend="i0">Performed the bidding; thro' the vampire<ptr target="#FNanchor_141_141"/> corpse</l>
<l rend="i4">He thrust his lance; it fell,</l>
<l rend="i4">And howling with the wound</l>
<l rend="i4">Its demon tenant fled.</l>
<l rend="i2">A sapphire light fell on them,</l>
<l rend="i0">And garmented with glory, in their sight</l>
<l rend="i4">Oneiza's Spirit stood.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"O Thalaba!" she cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Abandon not thyself!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Wouldst thou for ever lose me?... go, fulfill</l>
<l rend="i0">"Thy quest, that in the Bowers of Paradise</l>
<l rend="i0">"In vain I may not wait thee, O my Husband!"</l>
<l rend="i4">To Moath then the Spirit</l>
<l rend="i0">Turned the dark lustre of her Angel eyes,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Short is thy destined path,</l>
<l rend="i0">"O my dear father! to the abode of bliss.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Return to Araby,</l>
<l rend="i4">"There with the thought of death.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Comfort thy lonely age,</l>
<l rend="i2">"And Azrael the Deliverer, soon</l>
<l rend="i4">"Shall visit thee in peace."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">They stood with earnest eyes</l>
<l rend="i2">And arms out-reaching, when again</l>
<l rend="i4">The darkness closed around them.</l>
<l rend="i2">The soul of Thalaba revived;</l>
<l rend="i2">He from the floor the quiver took</l>
<l rend="i2">And as he bent the bow, exclaimed,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Was it the over-ruling Providence</l>
<l rend="i0">"That in the hour of frenzy led my hands</l>
<l rend="i4">"Instinctively to this?</l>
<l rend="i0">"To-morrow, and the sun shall brace anew</l>
<l rend="i0">"The slackened cord that now sounds loose and damp,</l>
<l rend="i0">"To-morrow, and its livelier tone will sing</l>
<l rend="i0">"In tort vibration to the arrow's flight.</l>
<l rend="i0">"I ... but I also, with recovered health</l>
<l rend="i4">"Of heart, shall do my duty.</l>
<l rend="i0">"My Father! here I leave thee then!" he cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And not to meet again</l>
<l rend="i2">"Till at the gate of Paradise</l>
<l rend="i0">"The eternal union of our joys commence.</l>
<l rend="i0">"We parted last in darkness!"... and the youth</l>
<l rend="i4">Thought with what other hopes,</l>
<l rend="i4">But now his heart was calm,</l>
<l rend="i0">For on his soul a heavenly hope had dawned.</l>
<l rend="i0">The Old Man answered nothing, but he held</l>
<l rend="i4">His garment and to the door</l>
<l rend="i2">Of the Tomb Chamber followed him.</l>
<l rend="i2">The rain had ceased, the sky was wild</l>
<l rend="i2">Its black clouds broken by the storm.</l>
<l rend="i2">And lo! it chanced that in the chasm</l>
<l rend="i4">Of Heaven between, a star,</l>
<l rend="i0">Leaving along its path continuous light,</l>
<l rend="i0">Shot eastward. "See my guide!" quoth Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i4">And turning, he received</l>
<l rend="i4">Old Moath's last embrace,</l>
<l rend="i2">And his last blessing.</l>
<l rend="i10">It was eve,</l><l rend="i0">When an old Dervise, sitting in the sun</l>
<l rend="i0">At his cell door, invited for the night</l>
<l rend="i4">The traveller; in the sun</l>
<l rend="i4">He spread the plain repast</l>
<l rend="i0">Rice and fresh grapes, and at their feet there flowed</l>
<l rend="i4">The brook of which they drank.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">So as they sate at meal,</l>
<l rend="i2">With song, with music, and with dance,</l>
<l rend="i4">A wedding train went by;</l>
<l rend="i2">The veiled bride, the female slaves,</l>
<l rend="i2">The torches of festivity,</l>
<l rend="i2">And trump and timbrel merriment</l>
<l rend="i4">Accompanied their way.</l>
<l rend="i4">The good old Dervise gave</l>
<l rend="i4">A blessing as they past.</l>
<l rend="i4">But Thalaba looked on,</l>
<l rend="i0">And breathed a low, deep groan, and hid his face.</l>
<l rend="i0">The Dervise had known sorrow; and he felt</l>
<l rend="i4">Compassion; and his words</l>
<l rend="i2">Of pity and of piety</l>
<l rend="i4">Opened the young man's heart</l>
<l rend="i4">And he told all his tale.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Repine not, O my Son!" the Old Man replied,</l>
<l rend="i4">"That Heaven has chastened thee.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Behold this vine,<ptr target="#FNanchor_142_142"/> I found it a wild tree</l>
<l rend="i2">"Whose wanton strength had swoln into</l>
<l rend="i0">"Irregular twigs, and bold excrescencies,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And spent itself in leaves and little rings,</l>
<l rend="i0">"In the vain flourish of its outwardness</l>
<l rend="i4">"Wasting the sap and strength</l>
<l rend="i4">"That should have given forth fruit.</l>
<l rend="i4">"But when I pruned the Tree,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Then it grew temperate in its vain expence</l>
<l rend="i0">"Of useless leaves, and knotted, as thou seest,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Into these full, clear, clusters, to repay</l>
<l rend="i2">"The hand whose foresight wounded it.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Repine not, O my Son!</l>
<l rend="i0">"In wisdom and in mercy Heaven inflicts,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Like a wise Leech, its painful remedies."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Then pausing, "whither goest thou now?" he asked.</l>
<l rend="i2">"I know not," answered Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Straight on, with Destiny my guide."</l>
<l rend="i0">Quoth the Old Man, "I will not blame thy trust,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And yet methinks thy feet</l>
<l rend="i4">"Should tread with certainty.</l>
<l rend="i0">"In Kaf the Simorg hath his dwelling place,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The all-knowing Bird of Ages, who hath seen</l>
<l rend="i0">"The World, with all her children, thrice destroyed.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Long is the thither path,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And difficult the way, of danger full;</l>
<l rend="i4">"But his unerring voice</l>
<l rend="i0">"Could point to certain end thy weary search."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Easy assent the youth</l>
<l rend="i0">Gave to the words of wisdom; and behold</l>
<l rend="i0">At dawn, the adventurer on his way to Kaf.</l>
<l rend="i2">And he has travelled many a day</l>
<l rend="i2">And many a river swum over,</l>
<l rend="i2">And many a mountain ridge has crost</l>
<l rend="i2">And many a measureless plain,</l>
<l rend="i2">And now amid the wilds advanced,</l>
<l rend="i4">Long is it since his eyes</l>
<l rend="i4">Have seen the trace of man.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Cold! cold! 'tis a chilly clime</l>
<l rend="i2">That the toil of the youth has reached,</l>
<l rend="i2">And he is aweary now,</l>
<l rend="i2">And faint for the lack of food.</l>
<l rend="i2">Cold! cold! there is no Sun in heaven</l>
<l rend="i2">But a heavy and uniform cloud</l>
<l rend="i2">And the snows begin to fall.</l>
<l rend="i0">Dost thou wish for thy deserts, O Son of Hodeirah?</l>
<l rend="i2">Dost thou long for the gales of Arabia?</l>
<l rend="i2">Cold! cold! his blood flows languid,</l>
<l rend="i2">His hands are red, his lips are blue,</l>
<l rend="i2">His feet are sore with the frost.</l>
<l rend="i2">Cheer thee! cheer thee! Thalaba!</l>
<l rend="i4">A little yet bear up!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">All waste! no sign of life</l>
<l rend="i2">But the track of the wolf and the bear!</l>
<l rend="i2">No sound but the wild, wild wind</l>
<l rend="i2">And the snow crunching under his feet!</l>
<l rend="i2">Night is come; no moon, no stars,</l>
<l rend="i2">Only the light of the snow!</l>
<l rend="i2">But behold a fire in the cave of the hill</l>
<l rend="i2">A heart-reviving fire;</l>
<l rend="i2">And thither with strength renewed</l>
<l rend="i2">Thalaba presses on.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">He found a Woman in the cave,</l>
<l rend="i2">A solitary Woman,</l>
<l rend="i2">Who by the fire was spinning</l>
<l rend="i2">And singing as she spun.</l>
<l rend="i2">The pine boughs they blazed chearfully</l>
<l rend="i2">And her face was bright with the flame.</l>
<l rend="i2">Her face was as a Damsel's face</l>
<l rend="i2">And yet her hair was grey.</l>
<l rend="i2">She bade him welcome with a smile</l>
<l rend="i2">And still continued spinning</l>
<l rend="i2">And singing as she spun.</l>
<l rend="i2">The thread the Woman drew</l>
<l rend="i2">Was finer than the silkworm's,</l>
<l rend="i2">Was finer than the gossamer.</l>
<l rend="i2">The song she sung was low and sweet</l>
<l rend="i2">And Thalaba knew not the words.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">He laid his bow before the hearth,</l>
<l rend="i2">For the string was frozen stiff.</l>
<l rend="i2">He took the quiver from his neck,</l>
<l rend="i2">For the arrow plumes were iced.</l>
<l rend="i2">Then as the chearful fire</l>
<l rend="i2">Revived his languid limbs,</l>
<l rend="i2">The adventurer asked for food.</l>
<l rend="i2">The Woman answered him,</l>
<l rend="i2">And still her speech was song,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The She Bear she dwells near to me,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And she hath cubs, one, two and three.</l>
<l rend="i0">"She hunts the deer and brings him here,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And then with her I make good cheer,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And she to the chase is gone</l>
<l rend="i4">"And she will be here anon."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">She ceased from her work as she spake,</l>
<l rend="i2">And when she had answered him,</l>
<l rend="i2">Again her fingers twirled the thread</l>
<l rend="i2">And again the Woman began</l>
<l rend="i2">In low, sweet, tones to sing</l>
<l rend="i2">The unintelligible song.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">The thread she spun it gleamed like gold</l>
<l rend="i2">In the light of the odorous fire,</l>
<l rend="i2">And yet so wonderous thin,</l>
<l rend="i2">That save when the light shone on it</l>
<l rend="i2">It could not be seen by the eye.</l>
<l rend="i2">The youth sate watching it,</l>
<l rend="i2">And she beheld his wonder.</l>
<l rend="i2">And then again she spake to him</l>
<l rend="i2">And still her speech was song,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Now twine it round thy hands I say,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Now twine it round thy hands I pray,</l>
<l rend="i0">"My thread is small, my thread is fine,</l>
<l rend="i4">"But he must be</l>
<l rend="i4">"A stronger than thee,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Who can break this thread of mine!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">And up she raised her bright blue eyes</l>
<l rend="i2">And sweetly she smiled on him,</l>
<l rend="i2">And he conceived no ill.</l>
<l rend="i2">And round and round his right hand,</l>
<l rend="i2">And round and round his left,</l>
<l rend="i2">He wound the thread so fine.</l>
<l rend="i2">And then again the Woman spake,</l>
<l rend="i2">And still her speech was song,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Now thy strength, O Stranger, strain,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Now then break the slender chain."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Thalaba strove, but the thread</l>
<l rend="i2">Was woven by magic hands,</l>
<l rend="i2">And in his cheek the flush of shame</l>
<l rend="i2">Arose, commixt with fear.</l>
<l rend="i2">She beheld and laughed at him,</l>
<l rend="i2">And then again she sung,</l>
<l rend="i0">"My thread is small, my thread is fine,</l>
<l rend="i4">"But he must be</l>
<l rend="i4">"A stronger than thee</l>
<l rend="i0">"Who can break this thread of mine."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">And up she raised her bright blue eyes</l>
<l rend="i2">And fiercely she smiled on him,</l>
<l rend="i0">"I thank thee, I thank thee, Hodeirah's Son!</l>
<l rend="i0">"I thank thee for doing what can't be undone,</l>
<l rend="i0">"For binding thyself in the chain I have spun!"</l>
<l rend="i2">Then from his head she wrenched</l>
<l rend="i2">A lock of his raven hair,</l>
<l rend="i2">And cast it in the fire</l>
<l rend="i2">And cried aloud as it burnt,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Sister! Sister! hear my voice!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Sister! Sister! come and rejoice,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The web is spun,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The prize is won,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The work is done,</l>
<l rend="i0">"For I have made captive Hoderiah's Son."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Borne in her magic car</l>
<l rend="i4">The Sister Sorceress came,</l>
<l rend="i0">Khawla, the fiercest of the Sorcerer brood.</l>
<l rend="i4">She gazed upon the youth,</l>
<l rend="i2">She bade him break the slender thread,</l>
<l rend="i4">She laughed aloud for scorn,</l>
<l rend="i4">She clapt her hands for joy.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">The She Bear from the chase came in,</l>
<l rend="i2">She bore the prey in her bloody mouth,</l>
<l rend="i0">She laid it at Maimuna's feet,</l>
<l rend="i0">And she looked up with wistful eyes</l>
<l rend="i2">As if to ask her share.</l>
<l rend="i2">"There! there!" quoth Maimuna</l>
<l rend="i0">And pointing to the prisoner youth</l>
<l rend="i2">She spurned him with her foot,</l>
<l rend="i2">And bade her make her meal.</l>
<l rend="i0">But soon their mockery failed them</l>
<l rend="i0">And anger and shame arose,</l>
<l rend="i0">For the She Bear fawned on Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i0">And quietly licked his hand.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">The grey haired Sorceress stamped the ground</l>
<l rend="i2">And called a Spirit up,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Shall we bear the Enemy</l>
<l rend="i0">"To the dungeon dens below?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">SPIRIT.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Woe! woe! to our Empire woe!</l>
<l rend="i0">If ever he tread the caverns below.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">MAIMUNA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Shall we leave him fettered here</l>
<l rend="i0">With hunger and cold to die?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">SPIRIT.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Away from thy lonely dwelling fly!</l>
<l rend="i0">Here I see a danger nigh</l>
<l rend="i0">That he should live and thou shouldst die.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">MAIMUNA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Whither must we bear the foe?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">SPIRIT.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">To Mohareb's island go,</l>
<l rend="i0">There shalt thou secure the foe,</l>
<l rend="i0">There prevent thy future woe.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Then in the Car they threw</l>
<l rend="i2">The fettered Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i2">And took their seats, and set</l>
<l rend="i2">Their feet upon his neck,</l>
<l rend="i2">Maimuna held the reins</l>
<l rend="i2">And Khawla shook the scourge</l>
<l rend="i2">And away!<ptr target="#FNanchor_143_143"/> away! away!</l>
<l rend="i2">They were no steeds of mortal race</l>
<l rend="i4">That drew the magic car</l>
<l rend="i2">With the swiftness of feet and of wings.</l>
<l rend="i2">The snow-dust rises behind them,</l>
<l rend="i2">The ice-rocks splinters fly,</l>
<l rend="i2">And hark! in the valley below</l>
<l rend="i2">The sound of their chariot wheels</l>
<l rend="i2">And they are far over the mountains.</l>
<l rend="i4">Away! away! away!</l>
<l rend="i4">The Demons of the air</l>
<l rend="i2">Shout their joy as the Sisters pass,</l>
<l rend="i0">The Ghosts of the Wicked that wander by night</l>
<l rend="i2">Flit over the magic car.</l>
<l rend="i4">Away! away! away!</l>
<l rend="i4">Over the hills and the plains</l>
<l rend="i4">Over the rivers and rocks,</l>
<l rend="i4">Over the sands of the shore;</l>
<l rend="i4">The waves of ocean heave</l>
<l rend="i4">Under the magic steeds,</l>
<l rend="i2">With unwet hoofs they trample the deep</l>
<l rend="i2">And now they reach the Island coast,</l>
<l rend="i0">And away to the city the Monarch's abode.</l>
<l rend="i4">Open fly the city gates,</l>
<l rend="i4">Open fly the iron doors</l>
<l rend="i4">The doors of the palace court.</l>
<l rend="i4">Then stopt the charmed car.</l>
<l rend="i2">The Monarch heard the chariot wheels</l>
<l rend="i4">And forth he came to greet</l>
<l rend="i4">The Mistress whom he served.</l>
<l rend="i4">He knew the captive youth,</l>
<l rend="i4">And Thalaba beheld</l>
<l rend="i0">Mohareb in<ptr target="#FNanchor_144_144"/> the robes of royalty,</l>

<l rend="i4">Her fine face raised to heaven,</l>
<l rend="i0">Her white hair flowing like the silver streams</l>

<l rend="i4">They hear her coming tread,</l>
<l rend="i4">They lift their asking eyes,</l>

<l rend="i2">She faced the points of Heaven,</l>

<l rend="i0">Giddily, giddily, still she whirls,</l>

<l rend="i0">The motion is ever the same,</l>
<l rend="i2">Ever around and around;</l>
<l rend="i0">The calling is still the same</l>
<l rend="i2">Still it is "Eblis! Eblis!"</l>
<l rend="i0">And her voice is a shapeless yell,</l>

<l rend="i2">They knelt in care beside her,</l>
<l rend="i4">Her Sister and the King.</l>

<l rend="i4">She wakes as from a dream,</l>

<l rend="i0">"Then let him live in long captivity!"</l>
<l rend="i0">She answered: but Mohareb's quickened eye</l>
<l rend="i2">Perused her sullen countenance</l>
<l rend="i4">That lied not with the lips.</l>
<l rend="i4">A miserable man!</l>
<l rend="i2">What boots it, that, in central caves</l>
<l rend="i0">The Powers of Evil at his Baptism pledged</l>

<l rend="i4">His death secures them now.</l>
<l rend="i4">What boots it that they gave</l>

<l rend="i0">'Twas the grey morning twilight, and the voice</l>
<l rend="i4">Of Thalaba in prayer,</l>
<l rend="i2">With words of hallowed import, smote</l>
<l rend="i4">The King's alarmed sense.</l>
<l rend="i2">The grating of the heavy hinge</l>
<l rend="i4">Roused not the Arabian youth;</l>
<l rend="i2">Nor lifted he his earthward face</l>
<l rend="i4">At sound of coming feet.</l>
<l rend="i0">Nor did Mohareb with unholy voice</l>
<l rend="i0">Disturb the duty: silent, spirit-awed,</l>
<l rend="i2">Envious, heart-humbled, he beheld</l>
<l rend="i2">The dungeon-peace of piety</l>
<l rend="i0">Till Thalaba, the perfect rite performed,</l>
<l rend="i0">Raised his calm eye; then spake the Island-Chief.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Arab! my guidance thro' the dangerous Cave,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Thy service overpaid,</l>
<l rend="i0">"An unintended friend in enmity.</l>
<l rend="i4">"The hand that caught thy ring</l>
<l rend="i0">"Received and bore me to the scene I sought.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Now know me grateful. I return</l>
<l rend="i0">"That amulet, thy only safety here."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Artful he spake, with show of gratitude</l>
<l rend="i4">Veiling the selfish deed.</l>
<l rend="i4">Locked in the magic chain</l>
<l rend="i2">The powerless hand of Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i4">Received again the Spell.</l>
<l rend="i0">Remembering then with what an ominous faith</l>
<l rend="i4">First he drew on the gem,</l>
<l rend="i0">The Youth repeats his words of augury;</l>
<l rend="i0">"In God's name and the Prophet's! be its power</l>
<l rend="i0">"Good, let it serve the holy! if for evil</l>
<l rend="i2">"God and my faith shall hallow it.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Blindly the wicked work</l>
<l rend="i4">"The righteous will of Heaven!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">So Thalaba received again</l>
<l rend="i4">The written ring of gold.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Thoughtful awhile Mohareb stood</l>
<l rend="i4">And eyed the captive youth.</l>
<l rend="i0">Then, building skilfully the sophist speech,</l>
<l rend="i0">Thus he began. "Brave art thou, Thalaba!</l>
<l rend="i0">"And wherefore are we foes!... for I would buy</l>
<l rend="i0">"Thy friendship at a princely price, and make thee</l>
<l rend="i4">"To thine own welfare wise.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Hear me! in Nature are two hostile Gods,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Makers and Masters of existing things,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Equal in power:... nay hear me patiently!...</l>
<l rend="i0">"Equal ... for look around thee! the same Earth</l>
<l rend="i0">"Bears fruit and poison; where the Camel finds</l>
<l rend="i0">"His fragrant<ptr target="#FNanchor_145_145"/> food, the horned Viper there</l>
<l rend="i0">"Sucks in the juice of death; the Elements</l>
<l rend="i0">"Now serve the use of man, and now assert</l>
<l rend="i0">"Dominion o'er his weakness; dost thou hear</l>
<l rend="i0">"The sound of merriment and nuptial song?</l>
<l rend="i0">"From the next house proceeds the mourner's cry</l>
<l rend="i0">"Lamenting o'er the dead. Sayest thou that Sin</l>
<l rend="i0">"Entered the world of Allah? that the Fiend</l>
<l rend="i0">"Permitted for a season, prowls for prey?</l>
<l rend="i0">"When to thy tent the venomous serpent creeps</l>
<l rend="i0">"Dost thou not crush the reptile? even so,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Besure, had Allah crushed his Enemy,</l>
<l rend="i0">"But that the power was wanting. From the first,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Eternal as themselves their warfare is,</l>
<l rend="i0">"To the end it must endure. Evil and Good....</l>
<l rend="i0">"What are they Thalaba but words? in the strife</l>
<l rend="i0">"Of Angels, as of men, the weak are guilty;</l>
<l rend="i0">"Power must decide. The Spirits of the Dead</l>
<l rend="i0">"Quitting their mortal mansion, enter not,</l>
<l rend="i0">"As falsely ye are preached, their final seat</l>
<l rend="i0">"Of bliss, or bale; nor in the sepulchre</l>
<l rend="i0">"Sleep they the long long sleep: each joins the host</l>
<l rend="i0">"Of his great Leader, aiding in the war</l>
<l rend="i4">"Whose fate involves his own.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Woe to the vanquished then!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Woe to the sons of man who followed him!</l>
<l rend="i0">"They with their Leader, thro' eternity,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Must howl in central fires.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Thou Thalaba hast chosen ill thy part,</l>
<l rend="i0">"If choice it may be called, where will was not,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Nor searching doubt, nor judgement wise to weigh.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Hard is the service of the Power beneath</l>
<l rend="i0">"Whose banners thou wert born; his discipline</l>
<l rend="i0">"Severe, yea cruel; and his wages, rich</l>
<l rend="i0">"Only in promise; who has seen the pay?</l>
<l rend="i0">"For us ... the pleasures of the world are ours,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Riches and rule, the kingdoms of the Earth.</l>
<l rend="i0">"We met in Babylon adventurers both,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Each zealous for the hostile Power he served:</l>
<l rend="i0">"We meet again; thou feelest what thou art,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Thou seest what I am, the Sultan here,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Lord of Life and Death.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Abandon him who has abandoned thee,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And be as I am, great among mankind!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">The Captive did not, hasty to confute</l>
<l rend="i4">Break of that subtle speech,</l>
<l rend="i0">But when the expectant silence of the King</l>
<l rend="i0">Looked for his answer, then spake Thalaba.</l>
<l rend="i0">"And this then is thy faith! this monstrous creed!</l>
<l rend="i0">"This lie against the Sun and Moon and Stars</l>
<l rend="i0">"And Earth and Heaven! blind man who canst not see</l>
<l rend="i0">"How all things work the best! who wilt not know</l>
<l rend="i0">"That in the Manhood of the World, whate'er</l>
<l rend="i0">"Of folly marked its Infancy, of vice</l>
<l rend="i0">"Sullied its Youth, ripe Wisdom shall cast off,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Stablished in good, and knowing evil safe.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Sultan Mohareb, yes, ye have me here</l>
<l rend="i0">"In chains; but not forsaken, tho' opprest:</l>
<l rend="i0">"Cast down, but not destroyed. Shall danger daunt,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Shall death dismay his soul, whose life is given</l>
<l rend="i0">"For God and for his brethren of mankind?</l>
<l rend="i0">"Alike rewarded, in that noble cause,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The Conquerors and the Martyrs palm above</l>
<l rend="i0">"Beam with one glory. Hope ye that my blood</l>
<l rend="i0">"Can quench the dreaded flame? and know ye not</l>
<l rend="i0">"That leagued against you are the Just and Wise,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And all Good Actions of all ages past,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Yea your own Crimes, and Truth, and God in Heaven!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"Slave!" quoth Mohareb, and his lips</l>
<l rend="i4">Quivered with eager wrath.</l>
<l rend="i2">"I have thee! thou shalt feel my power,</l>
<l rend="i2">"And in thy dungeon loathsomeness</l>
<l rend="i4">"Rot piece-meal, limb from limb!"</l>
<l rend="i4">And out the Tyrant rushes,</l>
<l rend="i2">And all impatient of the thoughts</l>
<l rend="i4">That cankered in his heart,</l>
<l rend="i0">Seeks in the giddiness of boisterous sport</l>
<l rend="i0">Short respite from the avenging power within.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">What Woman is she</l>
<l rend="i4">So wrinkled and old,</l>
<l rend="i4">That goes to the wood?</l>
<l rend="i4">She leans on her staff</l>
<l rend="i4">With a tottering step,</l>
<l rend="i2">She tells her bead-strings slow</l>
<l rend="i2">Thro' fingers dulled by age.</l>
<l rend="i2">The wanton boys bemock her.</l>
<l rend="i2">The babe in arms that meets her</l>
<l rend="i2">Turns round with quick affright</l>
<l rend="i2">And clings to his nurse's neck.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Hark! hark! the hunter's cry</l>
<l rend="i2">Mohareb gone to the chase!</l>
<l rend="i4">The dogs with eager yell</l>
<l rend="i4">Are struggling to be free;</l>
<l rend="i4">The hawks in frequent stoop</l>
<l rend="i4">Token their haste for flight;</l>
<l rend="i2">And couchant on the saddle-bow,</l>
<l rend="i2">With tranquil eyes and talons sheathed</l>
<l rend="i2">The ounce expects his liberty.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Propt on the staff that shakes</l>
<l rend="i4">Beneath her trembling weight,</l>
<l rend="i4">The Old Woman sees them pass.</l>
<l rend="i6">Halloa! halloa!</l>
<l rend="i6">The game is up!</l>
<l rend="i6">The dogs are loosed</l>
<l rend="i2">The deer bounds over the plain,</l>
<l rend="i4">The lagging dogs behind</l>
<l rend="i6">Follow from afar!</l>
<l rend="i2">But lo! the Falcon o'er his head.</l>
<l rend="i4">Hovers with hostile<ptr target="#FNanchor_146_146"/> wings,</l>
<l rend="i2">And buffets him with blinding strokes!</l>
<l rend="i2">Dizzy with the deafening strokes</l>
<l rend="i2">In blind and interrupted course,</l>
<l rend="i4">Poor beast be struggles on;</l>
<l rend="i4">And now the dogs are nigh!</l>
<l rend="i4">How his heart pants! you see</l>
<l rend="i4">The panting of his heart;</l>
<l rend="i4">And tears like human tears</l>
<l rend="i0">Roll down, along the big veins, fever-swoln;</l>
<l rend="i0">And now the death-sweat<ptr target="#FNanchor_147_147"/> darkens his dun hide!</l>
<l rend="i0">His fear, his groans, his agony, his death,</l>
<l rend="i0">Are the sport and the joy and the triumph!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Halloa! another prey,</l>
<l rend="i4">The nimble Antelope!</l>
<l rend="i4">The Ounce<ptr target="#FNanchor_148_148"/> is freed; one spring</l>
<l rend="i0">And his talons are sheathed in her shoulders,</l>
<l rend="i2">And his teeth are red in her gore.</l>
<l rend="i2">There came a sound from the wood,</l>
<l rend="i0">Like the howl of the winter wind at night</l>
<l rend="i4">Around a lonely dwelling,</l>
<l rend="i2">The Ounce whose gums were warm in his prey</l>
<l rend="i4">He hears the summoning sound.</l>
<l rend="i4">In vain his master's voice</l>
<l rend="i4">No longer dreaded now,</l>
<l rend="i2">Calls and recalls with threatful tone.</l>
<l rend="i4">Away to the forest he goes,</l>
<l rend="i4">For that Old Woman had laid</l>
<l rend="i0">Her shrivelled finger on her shrivelled lips,</l>
<l rend="i2">And whistled with a long, long breath,</l>
<l rend="i4">And that long breath was the sound</l>
<l rend="i0">Like the howl of the winter wind at night</l>
<l rend="i4">Around a lonely dwelling.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Mohareb knew her not,</l>
<l rend="i4">As to the chase he went,</l>
<l rend="i4">The glance of his proud eye</l>
<l rend="i0">Passing in scorn o'er age and wretchedness.</l>
<l rend="i2">She stands in the depth of the wood,</l>
<l rend="i4">And panting to her feet</l>
<l rend="i0">Fawning and fearful creeps the charmed ounce.</l>
<l rend="i0">Well mayst thou fear, and vainly dost thou fawn!</l>
<l rend="i2">Her form is changed, her visage new,</l>
<l rend="i4">Her power, her heart the same!</l>
<l rend="i2">It is Khawla that stands in the wood.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">She knew the place where the mandrake grew,</l>
<l rend="i4">And round the neck of the ounce,</l>
<l rend="i4">And round the mandrake's head</l>
<l rend="i2">She tightens the ends of her cord.</l>
<l rend="i4">Her ears are closed with wax,</l>
<l rend="i2">And her prest finger fastens them,</l>
<l rend="i0">Deaf as the Adder, when with grounded head</l>
<l rend="i0">And circled form, her avenues of sound</l>
<l rend="i4">Barred safely, one slant eye</l>
<l rend="i4">Watches the charmer's lips</l>
<l rend="i0">Waste on the wind his<ptr target="#FNanchor_149_149"/> baffled witchery.</l>
<l rend="i2">The spotted ounce so beautiful</l>
<l rend="i4">Springs forceful from the scourge:</l>
<l rend="i2">The dying plant all agony,</l>
<l rend="i4">Feeling its life-strings crack,</l>
<l rend="i0">Uttered the unimaginable groan</l>
<l rend="i4">That none can hear and live.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Then from her victim servant Khawla loosed</l>
<l rend="i0">The precious poison, next with naked hand</l>
<l rend="i2">She plucked the boughs of the manchineel.</l>
<l rend="i2">Then of the wormy wax she took,</l>
<l rend="i0">That from the perforated<ptr target="#FNanchor_150_150"/> tree forced out,</l>
<l rend="i0">Bewrayed its insect-parent's work within.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">In a cavern of the wood she sits</l>
<l rend="i2">And moulds the wax to human form,</l>
<l rend="i2">And as her fingers kneaded it,</l>
<l rend="i0">By magic accents, to the mystic shape</l>
<l rend="i0">Imparted with the life of Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i4">In all its passive powers</l>
<l rend="i4">Mysterious sympathy.</l>
<l rend="i2">With the Mandrake and the Manchineel</l>
<l rend="i4">She builds her pile accurst.</l>
<l rend="i2">She lays her finger to the pile,</l>
<l rend="i4">And blue and green, the flesh</l>
<l rend="i4">Glows with emitted fire,</l>
<l rend="i0">A fire<ptr target="#FNanchor_151_151"/> to kindle that strange fuel meet.</l>
<l rend="i0">Before the fire she placed the imaged wax,</l>
<l rend="i2">"There<ptr target="#FNanchor_152_152"/> waste away!" the Enchantress cried,</l>
<l rend="i2">"And with thee waste Hodeirah's Son!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Fool! fool! go thaw the everlasting ice,</l>
<l rend="i0">Whose polar mountains bound the human reign.</l>
<l rend="i4">Blindly the wicked work</l>
<l rend="i4">The righteous will of Heaven!</l>
<l rend="i0">The doomed Destroyer wears Abdaldar's ring!</l>
<l rend="i0">Against the danger of his horoscope</l>
<l rend="i4">Yourselves have shielded him!</l>
<l rend="i2">And on the sympathizing wax</l>
<l rend="i0">The unadmitted flames play powerlessly,</l>
<l rend="i0">As the cold moon-beam on a plain of snow.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Curse thee! curse thee!" cried the fiendly woman,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Hast thou yet a spell of safety?"</l>
<l rend="i4">And in the raging flames</l>
<l rend="i4">She cast the imaged wax.</l>
<l rend="i4">It lay amid the flames,</l>
<l rend="i4">Like Polycarp of old,</l>
<l rend="i0">When by the glories of the burning stake</l>
<l rend="i4">O'er vaulted, his grey hairs</l>
<l rend="i4">Curled, life-like, to the fire</l>
<l rend="i2">That haloed round his saintly brow.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Wherefore is this!" cried Khawla, and she stamped</l>
<l rend="i4">Thrice on the cavern floor,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Maimuna! Maimuna!"</l>
<l rend="i4">Thrice on the floor she stamped,</l>
<l rend="i2">Then to the rocky gateway glanced</l>
<l rend="i0">Her eager eyes, and Maimuna was there.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Nay Sister, nay!" quoth she, "Mohareb's life</l>
<l rend="i4">"Is linked with Thalaba's!</l>
<l rend="i2">"Nay Sister, nay! the plighted oath!</l>
<l rend="i4">"The common Sacrament!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Idiot!" said Khawla, "one must die, or all!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Faith kept with him were treason to the rest.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Why lies the wax, like marble, in the fire?</l>
<l rend="i4">"What powerful amulet</l>
<l rend="i4">"Protects Hodeirah's son?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Cold, marble-cold, the wax</l>
<l rend="i4">Lay on the raging pile,</l>
<l rend="i0">Cold in that white intensity of fire.</l>
<l rend="i0">The Bat that with her hooked and leathery wings</l>
<l rend="i2">Clung to the cave-roof, loosed her hold,</l>
<l rend="i4">Death-sickening with the heat;</l>
<l rend="i0">The Toad who to the darkest nook had crawled</l>
<l rend="i4">Panted fast with fever pain;</l>
<l rend="i2">The Viper from her nest came forth</l>
<l rend="i4">Leading her quickened brood,</l>
<l rend="i0">Who sportive with the warm delight, rolled out</l>
<l rend="i0">Their thin curls, tender as the tendril rings,</l>
<l rend="i0">Ere the green beauty of their brittle youth</l>
<l rend="i0">Grows brown, and toughens in the summer sun.</l>
<l rend="i4">Cold, marble-cold, the wax</l>
<l rend="i4">Lay on the raging pile,</l>
<l rend="i0">The silver quivering of the element</l>
<l rend="i0">O'er its pale surface shedding a dim gloss.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Amid the red and fiery smoke,</l>
<l rend="i4">Watching the strange portent,</l>
<l rend="i0">The blue-eyed Sorceress and her Sister stood,</l>
<l rend="i0">Seeming a ruined Angel by the side</l>
<l rend="i4">Of Spirit born in Hell.</l>
<l rend="i0">At length raised Maimuna her thoughtful eyes,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Whence Sister was the wax</l>
<l rend="i2">"The work of the worm, or the bee?</l>
<l rend="i4">"Nay then I marvel not!</l>
<l rend="i0">"It were as wise to bring from Ararat</l>
<l rend="i0">"The fore-world's<ptr target="#FNanchor_153_153"/> wood to build the magic pile,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And feed it from the balm bower, thro' whose veins</l>
<l rend="i0">"The Martyr's blood sends such a virtue out,</l>
<l rend="i0">"That the fond Mother from beneath its shade</l>
<l rend="i0">"Wreathes the Cerastes<ptr target="#FNanchor_154_154"/> round her playful child.</l>
<l rend="i0">"This the eternal, universal strife!</l>
<l rend="i0">"There is a grave-wax,<ptr target="#FNanchor_155_155"/>... I have seen the Gouls</l>
<l rend="i0">"Fight for the dainty at their banquetting."...</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Excellent witch!" quoth Khawla; and she went</l>
<l rend="i0">To the cave arch of entrance, and scowled up,</l>
<l rend="i4">Mocking the blessed Sun,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Shine thou in Heaven, but I will shadow Earth!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Thou wilt not shorten day,</l>
<l rend="i0">"But I will hasten darkness!" Then the Witch</l>
<l rend="i4">Began a magic song,</l>
<l rend="i2">One long low tone thro' teeth half-closed,</l>
<l rend="i2">Thro' lips slow-moving muttered slow,</l>
<l rend="i4">One long-continued breath,</l>
<l rend="i0">Till to her eyes a darker yellowness</l>
<l rend="i0">Was driven, and fuller swoln the prominent veins</l>
<l rend="i4">On her loose throat grew black.</l>
<l rend="i2">Then looking upward thrice she breathed</l>
<l rend="i4">Into the face of Heaven,</l>
<l rend="i2">The baneful breath infected Heaven;</l>
<l rend="i4">A mildewing mist it spread</l>
<l rend="i0">Darker and darker; so the evening sun</l>
<l rend="i0">Poured his unentering glory on the mist,</l>
<l rend="i4">And it was night below.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Bring now the wax," quoth Khawla, "for thou knowest</l>
<l rend="i0">"The mine that yields it!" forth went Maimuna,</l>
<l rend="i0">In mist and darkness went the Sorceress forth.</l>
<l rend="i2">And she has reached the place of Tombs,</l>
<l rend="i2">And in their sepulchres the dead</l>
<l rend="i0">Feel<ptr target="#FNanchor_156_156"/> feet unholy trampling over them.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Thou startest Maimuna,</l>
<l rend="i0">Because the breeze is in thy lilted locks!</l>
<l rend="i4">Is Khawla's spell so weak?</l>
<l rend="i2">Sudden came the breeze and strong;</l>
<l rend="i0">The mist that in the labouring lungs was felt</l>
<l rend="i0">So heavy late, flies now before the gale,</l>
<l rend="i4">Thin as an Infant's breath</l>
<l rend="i0">Seen in the sunshine of an autumn frost.</l>
<l rend="i0">Sudden it came and soon its work was done,</l>
<l rend="i4">And suddenly it ceased;</l>
<l rend="i0">Cloudless and calm it left the firmament,</l>
<l rend="i2">And beautiful in the blue sky</l>
<l rend="i4">Arose the summer Moon.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">She heard the quickened action of her blood,</l>
<l rend="i2">She felt the fever in her cheeks.</l>
<l rend="i2">Daunted, yet desperate, in a tomb</l>
<l rend="i2">Entering, with impious hand she traced</l>
<l rend="i4">Circles, and squares, and trines,</l>
<l rend="i4">And magic characters,</l>
<l rend="i2">Till riven by her charms the grave</l>
<l rend="i4">Yawned and disclosed its dead,</l>
<l rend="i0">Maimuna's eyes were opened, and she saw</l>
<l rend="i4">The secrets of the grave.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">There sate a Spirit in the vault,</l>
<l rend="i0">In shape, in hue, in lineaments like life,</l>
<l rend="i2">And by him couched, as if intranced,</l>
<l rend="i0">The hundred-headed Worm that never dies.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Nay Sorceress! not to-night!" the Spirit cried,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The flesh in which I sinned may rest to-night</l>
<l rend="i0">"From suffering; all things, even I to-night,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Even the Damned repose!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The flesh of Maimuna</l>
<l rend="i0">Crept on her bones with terror, and her knees</l>
<l rend="i2">Trembled with their trembling weight.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Only this sabbath! and at dawn the Worm</l>
<l rend="i0">"Will wake, and this poor flesh must grow to meet</l>
<l rend="i0">"The gnawing of his hundred<ptr target="#FNanchor_157_157"/> poison-mouths!</l>
<l rend="i0">"God! God! Is there no mercy after death?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Soul-struck she rushed away,</l>
<l rend="i4">She fled the place of Tombs,</l>
<l rend="i2">She cast herself upon the earth,</l>
<l rend="i0">All agony and tumult and despair.</l>
<l rend="i0">And in that wild and desperate agony</l>
<l rend="i0">Sure Maimuna had died the utter death,</l>
<l rend="i0">If aught of evil had been possible</l>
<l rend="i4">On this mysterious night;</l>
<l rend="i2">For this was that most holy<ptr target="#FNanchor_158_158"/> night</l>
<l rend="i0">When all created things know and adore</l>
<l rend="i0">The Power that made them; insects, beasts, and birds,</l>
<l rend="i0">The water-dwellers, herbs and trees and stones,</l>
<l rend="i0">Yea Earth and Ocean and the infinite Heaven</l>
<l rend="i0">With all its worlds. Man only does not know</l>
<l rend="i0">The universal sabbath, does not join</l>
<l rend="i0">With Nature in her homage. Yet the prayer</l>
<l rend="i0">Flows from the righteous with intenser love,</l>
<l rend="i0">A holier calm succeeds, and sweeter dreams</l>
<l rend="i0">Visit the slumbers of the penitent.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Therefore on Maimuna the elements,</l>
<l rend="i0">Shed healing; every breath she breathed was balm.</l>
<l rend="i0">Was not a flower but sent in incense up</l>
<l rend="i0">Its richest odours, and the song of birds</l>
<l rend="i0">Now, like the music of the Seraphim,</l>
<l rend="i4">Entered her soul, and now</l>
<l rend="i0">Made silence aweful by their sudden pause.</l>
<l rend="i2">It seemed as if the quiet moon</l>
<l rend="i2">Poured quietness, its lovely light</l>
<l rend="i0">Was like the smile of reconciling Heaven.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Is it the dew of night</l>
<l rend="i4">That down her glowing cheek</l>
<l rend="i0">Shines in the moon-beam? oh! she weeps ... she weeps</l>
<l rend="i0">And the Good Angel that abandoned her</l>
<l rend="i0">At her hell-baptism, by her tears drawn down</l>
<l rend="i2">Resumes his charge, then Maimuna</l>
<l rend="i0">Recalled to mind the double oracle;</l>
<l rend="i4">Quick as the lightening flash</l>
<l rend="i0">Its import glanced upon her, and the hope</l>
<l rend="i2">Of pardon and salvation rose,</l>
<l rend="i4">As now she understood</l>
<l rend="i2">The lying prophecy of truth.</l>
<l rend="i2">She pauses not, she ponders not,</l>
<l rend="i0">The driven air before her fanned the face</l>
<l rend="i0">Of Thalaba, and he awoke and saw</l>
<l rend="i2">The Sorceress of the silver locks.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">One more permitted spell!</l>
<l rend="i4">She takes the magic chain.</l>
<l rend="i0">With the wide eye of wonder, Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i0">Watches her snowy fingers round and round</l>
<l rend="i4">Wind the loosening chain.</l>
<l rend="i2">Again he hears the low sweet voice,</l>
<l rend="i2">The low sweet voice so musical,</l>
<l rend="i4">That sure it was not strange,</l>
<l rend="i0">If in those unintelligible tones</l>
<l rend="i2">Was more than human potency,</l>
<l rend="i0">That with such deep and undefined delight,</l>
<l rend="i4">Filled the surrendered soul.</l>
<l rend="i2">The work is done, the song is ceased;</l>
<l rend="i0">He wakes as from a dream of Paradise</l>
<l rend="i0">And feels his fetters gone, and with the burst</l>
<l rend="i0">Of wondering adoration praises God.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Her charm has loosed the chain it bound,</l>
<l rend="i2">But massy walls and iron gates</l>
<l rend="i4">Confine Hodeirah's son.</l>
<l rend="i0">Heard ye not, Genii of the Air, her spell,</l>
<l rend="i4">That o'er her face there flits</l>
<l rend="i4">The sudden flush of fear?</l>
<l rend="i0">Again her louder lips repeat the charm,</l>
<l rend="i2">Her eye is anxious, her cheek pale,</l>
<l rend="i4">Her pulse plays fast and feeble.</l>
<l rend="i2">Nay Maimuna! thy power has ceased,</l>
<l rend="i4">And the wind scatters now</l>
<l rend="i4">The voice that ruled it late.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"Pray for me, Thalaba," she cried,</l>
<l rend="i2">"For death and judgement are at hand!"</l>
<l rend="i4">All night in agony,</l>
<l rend="i0">She feared the instant blow of Hell's revenge.</l>
<l rend="i0">At dawn the sound of gathering multitudes</l>
<l rend="i0">Led to the prison bars her dreading eye.</l>
<l rend="i4">What spectacle invites</l>
<l rend="i4">The growing multitude,</l>
<l rend="i2">That torrent-like they roll along?</l>
<l rend="i0">Boys and grey-headed age; the Mother comes</l>
<l rend="i2">Leading her child, who at arm's length</l>
<l rend="i4">Outstripping her, looks back</l>
<l rend="i4">And bids her hasten more.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Why does the City pour her thousands forth?</l>
<l rend="i4">What glorious pageantry</l>
<l rend="i0">Makes her streets desolate, and silences</l>
<l rend="i0">Her empty dwellings? comes the bridal pomp,</l>
<l rend="i0">And have the purveyors of imperial lust</l>
<l rend="i2">Torn from their parents arms again</l>
<l rend="i2">The virgin beauties of the land?</l>
<l rend="i0">Will elephants in gilded cages bear</l>
<l rend="i0">The imprisoned victims? or may yet their eyes</l>
<l rend="i0">With a last look of liberty, behold</l>
<l rend="i0">Banners and guards and silk-arched palanquins.</l>
<l rend="i0">The long procession, and the gorgeous pomp</l>
<l rend="i4">Of their own sacrifice?</l>
<l rend="i0">On the house tops and in the windows ranged</l>
<l rend="i4">Face above face, they wait</l>
<l rend="i4">The coming spectacle;</l>
<l rend="i0">The trees are clustered, and below the dust</l>
<l rend="i4">Thro' the thronged populace</l>
<l rend="i4">Can find no way to rise.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">He comes! the Sultan! hark the swelling horn,</l>
<l rend="i4">The trumpet's spreading blair,</l>
<l rend="i0">The timbrel tinkling as its silver bells</l>
<l rend="i0">Twinkle aloft, and the shrill cymbal's sound,</l>
<l rend="i0">Whose broad brass flashes in the morning sun</l>
<l rend="i0">Accordant light and music! closing all</l>
<l rend="i4">The heavy Gong is heard,</l>
<l rend="i0">That falls like thunder on the dizzy ear.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">On either hand the thick-wedged crowd</l>
<l rend="i4">Fall from the royal path.</l>
<l rend="i0">Recumbent in the palanquin he casts</l>
<l rend="i0">On the wide tumult of the waving throng</l>
<l rend="i4">A proud and idle eye.</l>
<l rend="i0">Now in his tent alighted, he receives</l>
<l rend="i0">Homage and worship. The slave multitude</l>
<l rend="i2">With shouts of blasphemy adore</l>
<l rend="i0">Him, father of his people! him their Lord!</l>
<l rend="i0">Great King, all-wise, all-mighty, and all-good!</l>
<l rend="i0">Whose smile was happiness, whose frown was death,</l>
<l rend="i4">Their present Deity!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">With silken cords his slaves</l>
<l rend="i0">Wave the silk<ptr target="#FNanchor_159_159"/> fan, that waving o'er his head</l>
<l rend="i4">Freshens the languid air.</l>
<l rend="i2">Others the while shower o'er his robes</l>
<l rend="i4">The rose's treasured sweets,</l>
<l rend="i0">Rich odours burn before him, ambergrese,</l>
<l rend="i4">Sandal and aloe wood,</l>
<l rend="i0">And thus inhaling the voluptuous air</l>
<l rend="i2">He sits to watch the agony,</l>
<l rend="i4">To hear the groan of death.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">At once all sounds are hushed,</l>
<l rend="i0">All eyes take one direction, for he comes,</l>
<l rend="i0">The object he of this day's festival,</l>
<l rend="i0">Of all this expectation and this joy,</l>
<l rend="i0">The Christian captive. Hark! so silently</l>
<l rend="i0">They stand, the clanking of his chain is heard.</l>
<l rend="i0">And he has reached the place of suffering now.</l>
<l rend="i0">And as the death's-men round his ancles bind</l>
<l rend="i0">The cords and to the gibbet swing him up,</l>
<l rend="i0">The Priests begin their song, the song of praise,</l>
<l rend="i0">The hymn of glory to their Devil-God.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Then Maimuna grew pale, as thro the bars</l>
<l rend="i0">She saw the Martyr pendant by the feet,</l>
<l rend="i0">His gold locks hanging downwards, and she cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"This is my Sister's deed!</l>
<l rend="i4">"O Thalaba, for us,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Not for his faith the red-haired Christian dies.</l>
<l rend="i0">"She wants the foam<ptr target="#FNanchor_160_160"/> that in his agony,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Last from his lips shall fall,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The deadliest poison that the Devils know.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Son of Hodeirah, thou and I</l>
<l rend="i4">"Shall prove its deadly force!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">And lo! the Executioners begin</l>
<l rend="i0">And beat his belly with alternate blows.</l>
<l rend="i2">And these are human that look on;...</l>
<l rend="i2">The very women that would shrink</l>
<l rend="i2">And shudder if they saw a worm</l>
<l rend="i4">Crushed by the careless tread,</l>
<l rend="i4">They clap their hands for joy</l>
<l rend="i4">And lift their children up</l>
<l rend="i4">To see the Christian die.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Convulsing Nature with her tortures drunk</l>
<l rend="i4">Ceases to suffer now.</l>
<l rend="i2">His eye-lids tremble, his lips quake,</l>
<l rend="i0">But like the quivering of a severed limb</l>
<l rend="i4">Move no responsive pang.</l>
<l rend="i0">Now catch the exquisite poison! for it froths</l>
<l rend="i0">His dying lips,... and Khawla holds the bowl.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Enough the Island crimes had cried to Heaven,</l>
<l rend="i2">The measure of their guilt was full,</l>
<l rend="i4">The hour of wrath was come.</l>
<l rend="i4">The poison burst the bowl,</l>
<l rend="i4">It fell upon the earth.</l>
<l rend="i0">The Sorceress shrieked and caught Mohareb's robe</l>
<l rend="i2">And called the whirlwind and away!</l>
<l rend="i0">For lo! from that accursed venom springs,</l>
<l rend="i4">The Upas Tree of Death.</l></lg>
</div>

<div type="book"><head>THE TENTH BOOK.</head>
<lg>
<l rend="i0">Alone, beside a rivulet it stands</l>
<l rend="i4">The Upas<ptr target="#FNanchor_161_161"/> Tree of Death.</l>
<l rend="i0">Thro' barren banks the barren waters flow,</l>
<l rend="i0">The fish that meets them in the unmingling sea</l>
<l rend="i4">Floats poisoned on the waves.</l>
<l rend="i0">Tree grows not near, nor bush, nor flower, nor herb,</l>
<l rend="i0">The Earth has lost its parent powers of life</l>
<l rend="i0">And the fresh dew of Heaven that there descends,</l>
<l rend="i4">Steams in rank poison up.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Before the appointed Youth and Maimuna</l>
<l rend="i0">Saw the first struggle of the dying throng,</l>
<l rend="i4">Crash sunk their prison wall!</l>
<l rend="i4">The whirlwind wrapt them round;</l>
<l rend="i2">Borne in the Chariot of the Winds</l>
<l rend="i0">Ere there was time to fear, their way was past,</l>
<l rend="i4">And lo! again they stand</l>
<l rend="i0">In the cave-dwelling of the blue-eyed Witch.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Then came the weakness of her natural age</l>
<l rend="i4">At once on Maimuna;</l>
<l rend="i4">The burthen of her years</l>
<l rend="i4">Fell on her, and she knew</l>
<l rend="i0">That her repentance in the sight of God</l>
<l rend="i0">Had now found favour, and her hour was come.</l>
<l rend="i0">Her death was like the righteous; "Turn my face</l>
<l rend="i2">"To Mecca!" in her languid eyes.</l>
<l rend="i4">The joy of certain hope</l>
<l rend="i2">Lit a last lustre, and in death</l>
<l rend="i4">The smile was on her cheek.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">No faithful<ptr target="#FNanchor_162_162"/> crowded round her bier,</l>
<l rend="i2">No tongue reported her good deeds,</l>
<l rend="i2">For her no mourners wailed and wept,</l>
<l rend="i2">No Iman o'er her perfumed corpse,</l>
<l rend="i2">For her soul's health intoned the prayer;</l>
<l rend="i2">No column<ptr target="#FNanchor_163_163"/> raised by the way side</l>
<l rend="i2">Implored the passing traveller</l>
<l rend="i2">To say a requiem for the dead.</l>
<l rend="i2">Thalaba laid her in the snow,</l>
<l rend="i2">And took his weapons from the hearth,</l>
<l rend="i2">And then once more the youth began</l>
<l rend="i2">His weary way of solitude.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">The breath of the East is in his face</l>
<l rend="i2">And it drives the sleet and the snow.</l>
<l rend="i2">The air is keen, the wind is keen,</l>
<l rend="i2">His limbs are aching with the cold,</l>
<l rend="i2">His eyes are aching<ptr target="#FNanchor_164_164"/> with the snow,</l>
<l rend="i4">His very heart is cold,</l>
<l rend="i0">His spirit chilled within him. He looks on</l>
<l rend="i4">If ought of life be near,</l>
<l rend="i0">But all is sky and the white wilderness,</l>
<l rend="i0">And here and there a solitary pine,</l>
<l rend="i0">Its branches broken by the weight of snow.</l>
<l rend="i2">His pains abate, his senses dull</l>
<l rend="i2">With suffering, cease to suffer.</l>
<l rend="i4">Languidly, languidly,</l>
<l rend="i4">Thalaba drags along,</l>
<l rend="i2">A heavy weight is on his lids,</l>
<l rend="i2">His limbs move slow with heaviness,</l>
<l rend="i4">And he full fain would sleep.</l>
<l rend="i2">Not yet, not yet, O Thalaba!</l>
<l rend="i4">Thy hour of rest is come;</l>
<l rend="i2">Not yet may the Destroyer sleep</l>
<l rend="i4">The comfortable sleep,</l>
<l rend="i2">His journey is not over yet,</l>
<l rend="i4">His course not yet fulfilled;...</l>
<l rend="i2">Run thou thy race, O Thalaba!</l>
<l rend="i4">The prize is at the goal.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">It was a Cedar-tree</l>
<l rend="i0">That woke him from the deadly drowsiness;</l>
<l rend="i0">Its broad, round-spreading<ptr target="#FNanchor_165_165"/> branches when they felt</l>
<l rend="i0">The snow, rose upward in a point to heaven,</l>
<l rend="i2">And standing in their strength erect,</l>
<l rend="i4">Defied the baffled storm.</l>
<l rend="i2">He knew the lesson Nature gave,</l>
<l rend="i2">And he shook off his heaviness,</l>
<l rend="i4">And hope revived within him.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Now sunk the evening sun,</l>
<l rend="i4">A broad, red, beamless orb,</l>
<l rend="i4">Adown the glowing sky;</l>
<l rend="i0">Thro' the red light the snow-flakes fell, like fire.</l>
<l rend="i2">Louder grows the biting wind,</l>
<l rend="i2">And it drifts the dust of the snow.</l>
<l rend="i2">The snow is clotted in his hair,</l>
<l rend="i4">The breath of Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i4">Is iced upon his lips.</l>
<l rend="i2">He looks around, the darkness,</l>
<l rend="i2">The dizzy floating of the snow,</l>
<l rend="i4">Close in his narrow view.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">At length thro' the thick atmosphere a light</l>
<l rend="i4">Not distant far appears.</l>
<l rend="i0">He doubting other wiles of enmity,</l>
<l rend="i2">With mingled joy and quicker step,</l>
<l rend="i4">Bends his way thitherward.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">It was a little, lowly dwelling place,</l>
<l rend="i0">Amid a garden, whose delightful air</l>
<l rend="i0">Felt mild and fragrant, as the evening wind</l>
<l rend="i0">Passing in summer o'er the coffee-groves<ptr target="#FNanchor_166_166"/></l>
<l rend="i0">Of Yemen and its blessed bowers of balm.</l>
<l rend="i0">A Fount of Fire that in the centre played,</l>
<l rend="i0">Rolled all around its wonderous rivulets</l>
<l rend="i0">And fed the garden with the heat of life.</l>
<l rend="i0">Every where magic! the Arabian's heart</l>
<l rend="i2">Yearned after human intercourse.</l>
<l rend="i4">A light!... the door unclosed!...</l>
<l rend="i4">All silent ... he goes in.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">There lay a Damsel sleeping on a couch,</l>
<l rend="i0">His step awoke her, and she gazed at him</l>
<l rend="i4">With pleased and wondering look,</l>
<l rend="i2">Fearlessly, like a yearling child</l>
<l rend="i4">Too ignorant to fear.</l>
<l rend="i4">With words of courtesy</l>
<l rend="i4">The young intruder spake.</l>
<l rend="i2">At the sound of his voice a joy</l>
<l rend="i4">Kindled her bright black eyes;</l>
<l rend="i4">She rose and took his hand,</l>
<l rend="i0">But at the touch the smile forsook her cheek,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Oh! it is cold!" she cried,</l>
<l rend="i0">"I thought I should have felt it warm like mine,</l>
<l rend="i4">"But thou art like the rest!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Thalaba stood mute awhile</l>
<l rend="i4">And wondering at her words:</l>
<l rend="i0">"Cold? Lady!" then he said; "I have travelled long</l>
<l rend="i4">"In this cold wilderness,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Till life is almost spent!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LAILA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Art thou a Man then?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">I did not think</l>
<l rend="i0">Sorrow and toil could so have altered me,</l>
<l rend="i0">That I seem otherwise.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LAILA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">  And thou canst be warm</l>
<l rend="i0">Sometimes? life-warm as I am?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i12">Surely Lady</l><l rend="i0">As others are, I am, to heat and cold</l>
<l rend="i0">Subject like all, you see a Traveller,</l>
<l rend="i0">Bound upon hard adventure, who requests</l>
<l rend="i0">Only to rest him here to-night, to-morrow</l>
<l rend="i0">He will pursue his way.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LAILA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">   Oh ... not to-morrow!</l>
<l rend="i0">Not like a dream of joy, depart so soon!</l>
<l rend="i0">And whither wouldst thou go? for all around</l>
<l rend="i0">Is everlasting winter, ice and snow,</l>
<l rend="i0">Deserts unpassable of endless frost.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">He who has led me here will still sustain me</l>
<l rend="i0">Thro' cold and hunger.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"Hunger?" Laila cried;</l>
<l rend="i4">She clapt her lilly hands,</l>
<l rend="i0">And whether from above or from below</l>
<l rend="i4">It came, sight could not see,</l>
<l rend="i0">So suddenly the floor was spread with food.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LAILA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Why dost thou watch with hesitating eyes</l>
<l rend="i0">The banquet? 'tis for thee! I bade it come.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Whence came it?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LAILA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i6">  Matters it from whence it came</l>
<l rend="i0">My father sent it: when I call, he hears.</l>
<l rend="i0">Nay ... thou hast fabled with me! and art like</l>
<l rend="i0">The forms that wait upon my solitude,</l>
<l rend="i0">Human to eye alone;... thy hunger would not</l>
<l rend="i0">Question so idly else.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">I will not eat!</l>
<l rend="i0">It came by magic! fool to think that aught</l>
<l rend="i0">But fraud and danger could await me here!</l>
<l rend="i0">Let loose my cloak!...</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LAILA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">  Begone then, insolent!</l>
<l rend="i0">Why dost thou stand and gaze upon my face?</l>
<l rend="i0">Aye! watch the features well that threaten thee</l>
<l rend="i0">With fraud and danger! in the wilderness</l>
<l rend="i0">They shall avenge me,... in the hour of want</l>
<l rend="i2">Rise on thy view, and make thee feel</l>
<l rend="i4">How innocent I am:</l>
<l rend="i0">And this remembered cowardice and insult</l>
<l rend="i0">With a more painful shame will burn thy cheek</l>
<l rend="i0">Than now beats mine in anger!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i12">Mark me Lady!</l><l rend="i0">Many and restless are my enemies;</l>
<l rend="i0">My daily paths have been beset with snares</l>
<l rend="i0">Till I have learnt suspicion, bitter sufferings</l>
<l rend="i0">Teaching the needful vice, if I have wronged you,</l>
<l rend="i0">And yours should be the face of innocence,</l>
<l rend="i0">I pray you pardon me! in the name of God,</l>
<l rend="i0">And of his Prophet, I partake your food.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LAILA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Lo now! thou wert afraid of sorcery,</l>
<l rend="i0">And yet hast said a charm!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i10">A charm?</l></lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LAILA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i14">And wherefore?</l><l rend="i0">Is it not not delicate food? what mean thy words?</l>
<l rend="i0">I have heard many spells and many names</l>
<l rend="i0">That rule the Genii and the Elements,</l>
<l rend="i0">But never these.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i6">How! never heard the names</l>
<l rend="i0">Of God and of the Prophet?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LAILA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i11">Never ... nay now</l><l rend="i0">Again that troubled eye? thou art a strange man</l>
<l rend="i0">And wonderous fearful ... but I must not twice</l>
<l rend="i0">Be charged with fraud! if thou suspectest still,</l>
<l rend="i0">Depart and leave me!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">And you do not know</l>
<l rend="i0">The God that made you?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LAILA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i10">Made me, man! my Father</l><l rend="i0">Made me. He made this dwelling, and the grove,</l>
<l rend="i0">And yonder fountain-fire, and every morn</l>
<l rend="i0">He visits me, and takes the snow, and moulds</l>
<l rend="i0">Women and men, like thee; and breathes into them</l>
<l rend="i0">Motion, and life, and sense,... but to the touch</l>
<l rend="i0">They are chilling cold, and ever when night closes</l>
<l rend="i0">They melt away again, and leave me here</l>
<l rend="i0">Alone and sad. Oh then how I rejoice</l>
<l rend="i0">When it is day and my dear Father comes,</l>
<l rend="i0">And chears me with kind words and kinder looks!</l>
<l rend="i0">My dear, dear, Father! were it not for him,</l>
<l rend="i0">I am so weary of this loneliness,</l>
<l rend="i0">That I should wish I also were of snow</l>
<l rend="i0">That I might melt away, and cease to be.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">And have you always had your dwelling here</l>
<l rend="i0">Amid this solitude of snow?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LAILA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i11">I think so.</l><l rend="i0">I can remember with unsteady feet</l>
<l rend="i0">Tottering from room to room, and finding pleasure</l>
<l rend="i0">In flowers and toys and sweetmeats, things that long</l>
<l rend="i0">Have lost their power to please; that when I see them</l>
<l rend="i0">Raise only now a melancholy wish</l>
<l rend="i0">I were the little trifler once again</l>
<l rend="i0">That could be pleased so lightly!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i12">Then you know not</l><l rend="i0">Your Father's art?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LAILA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">No. I besought him once</l>
<l rend="i0">To give me power like his, that where he went</l>
<l rend="i0">I might go with him: but he shook his head,</l>
<l rend="i0">And said it was a power too dearly bought,</l>
<l rend="i0">And kist me with the tenderness of tears.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">And wherefore has he hidden you thus far</l>
<l rend="i0">From all the ways of humankind?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LAILA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i12">'Twas fear,</l><l rend="i0">Fatherly fear and love. He read<ptr target="#FNanchor_167_167"/> the stars</l>
<l rend="i0">And saw a danger in my destiny,</l>
<l rend="i0">And therefore placed me here amid the snows,</l>
<l rend="i0">And laid a spell that never human eye,</l>
<l rend="i0">If foot of man by chance should reach the depth</l>
<l rend="i0">Of this wide waste, shall see one trace of grove,</l>
<l rend="i0">Garden, or dwelling-place, or yonder fire,</l>
<l rend="i0">That thaws and mitigates the frozen sky.</l>
<l rend="i0">And more than this, even if the enemy</l>
<l rend="i0">Should come, I have a guardian here.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i14">A guardian?</l></lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LAILA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">'Twas well that when my sight unclosed upon thee</l>
<l rend="i0">There was no dark suspicion in thy face.</l>
<l rend="i0">Else I had called his succour! wilt thou see him?</l>
<l rend="i0">But if a Woman can have terrified thee,</l>
<l rend="i0">How wilt thou bare his unrelaxing brow</l>
<l rend="i0">And lifted lightnings?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">Lead me to him, Lady!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">She took him by the hand</l>
<l rend="i4">And thro' the porch they past.</l>
<l rend="i2">Over the garden and the grove</l>
<l rend="i4">The fountain streams of fire</l>
<l rend="i4">Poured a broad light like noon.</l>
<l rend="i4">A broad unnatural light</l>
<l rend="i0">That made the Rose's blush of beauty pale,</l>
<l rend="i0">And dimmed the rich Geranium's scarlet blaze.</l>
<l rend="i2">The various verdure of the grove</l>
<l rend="i0">Now wore one undistinguishable grey,</l>
<l rend="i4">Checqured with blacker shade.</l>
<l rend="i4">Suddenly Laila stopt,</l>
<l rend="i0">"I do not think thou art the enemy,"</l>
<l rend="i4">She said, "but He will know!</l>
<l rend="i2">"If thou hast meditated wrong</l>
<l rend="i4">"Stranger, depart in time....</l>
<l rend="i2">"I would not lead thee to thy death!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The glance of Laila's eye</l>
<l rend="i0">Turned anxiously toward the Arabian youth.</l>
<l rend="i0">"So let him pierce my heart," cried Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i0">"If it hide thought to harm you!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LAILA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i12">'Tis a figure,</l><l rend="i0">Almost I fear to look at!... yet come on.</l>
<l rend="i0">'Twill ease me of a heaviness that seems</l>
<l rend="i0">To sink my heart; and thou mayest dwell here then.</l>
<l rend="i0">In safety;... for thou shalt not go to-morrow,</l>
<l rend="i0">Nor on the after, nor the after day,</l>
<l rend="i0">Nor ever! it was only solitude</l>
<l rend="i4">That made my misery here,...</l>
<l rend="i0">And now that I can see a human face,</l>
<l rend="i4">And hear a human voice....</l>
<l rend="i4">Oh no! thou wilt not leave me!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Alas I must not rest!</l>
<l rend="i0">The star that ruled at my nativity</l>
<l rend="i0">Shone with a strange and blasting influence.</l>
<l rend="i0">O gentle Lady! I should draw upon you</l>
<l rend="i0">A killing curse.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LAILA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i6">But I will ask my Father</l>
<l rend="i0">To save you from all danger, and you know not</l>
<l rend="i0">The wonders he can work, and when I ask</l>
<l rend="i0">It is not in his power to say me nay.</l>
<l rend="i0">Perhaps thou knowest the happiness it is</l>
<l rend="i0">To have a tender father?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i10">He was one</l><l rend="i0">Whom like a loathsome leper I have tainted</l>
<l rend="i0">With my contagious destiny. At evening</l>
<l rend="i0">He kist me as he wont, and laid his hands</l>
<l rend="i0">Upon my head, and blest me ere I slept.</l>
<l rend="i0">His dying groan awoke me, for the Murderer</l>
<l rend="i0">Had stolen upon our sleep! for me was meant</l>
<l rend="i0">The midnight blow of death; my father died,</l>
<l rend="i0">The brother play-mates of my infancy,</l>
<l rend="i0">The baby at the breast, they perished all,</l>
<l rend="i0">All in that dreadful hour: but I was saved</l>
<l rend="i4">To remember and revenge.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">She answered not, for now</l>
<l rend="i0">Emerging from the o'er-arched avenue</l>
<l rend="i2">The finger of her upraised hand</l>
<l rend="i0">Marked where the Guardian of the garden stood.</l>
<l rend="i0">It was a brazen<ptr target="#FNanchor_168_168"/> Image, every limb</l>
<l rend="i0">And swelling vein and muscle, true to life:</l>
<l rend="i4">The left knee bending on,</l>
<l rend="i0">The other straight, firm planted, and his hand</l>
<l rend="i4">Lifted on high to hurl</l>
<l rend="i4">The Lightning that it grasped.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">When Thalaba approached,</l>
<l rend="i0">The charmed Image knew Hodeirah's son,</l>
<l rend="i0">And hurled the lightning at the dreaded foe.</l>
<l rend="i4">The Ring! the saviour Ring!</l>
<l rend="i0">Full in his face the lightning-bolt was driven,</l>
<l rend="i4">The scattered fire recoiled.</l>
<l rend="i0">Like the flowing of a summer gale he felt</l>
<l rend="i4">Its ineffectual force,</l>
<l rend="i2">His countenance was not changed,</l>
<l rend="i2">Nor a hair of his head was singed.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">He started and his glance</l>
<l rend="i2">Turned angrily upon the Maid,</l>
<l rend="i0">The sight disarmed suspicion ... breathless, pale,</l>
<l rend="i4">Against a tree she stood.</l>
<l rend="i2">Her wan lips quivering, and her eye</l>
<l rend="i0">Upraised, in silent supplicating fear.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">She started with a scream of joy</l>
<l rend="i4">Seeing her Father there,</l>
<l rend="i0">And ran and threw her arms around his neck,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Save me!" she cried, "the Enemy is come!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Save me! save me! Okba!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"Okba!" repeats the youth,</l>
<l rend="i4">For never since that hour</l>
<l rend="i0">When in the Tent the Spirit told his name,</l>
<l rend="i4">Had Thalaba let slip</l>
<l rend="i0">The memory of his Father's murderer;</l>
<l rend="i4">"Okba!"... and in his hand</l>
<l rend="i4">He graspt an arrow-shaft.</l>
<l rend="i2">And he rushed on to strike him.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Son of Hodeirah!" the Old Man replied,</l>
<l rend="i4">"My hour is not yet come."</l>
<l rend="i4">And putting forth his hand</l>
<l rend="i2">Gently he repelled the Youth.</l>
<l rend="i4">"My hour is not yet come!</l>
<l rend="i0">"But thou mayest shed this innocent Maiden's blood,</l>
<l rend="i2">"That vengeance God allows thee."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Around her Father's neck</l>
<l rend="i4">Still Laila's hands were clasped.</l>
<l rend="i2">Her face was turned to Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i0">A broad light floated o'er its marble paleness,</l>
<l rend="i2">As the wind waved the fountain fire.</l>
<l rend="i0">Her large, dilated eye in horror raised</l>
<l rend="i4">Watched his every movement.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Not upon her," said he,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Not upon her Hodeirah's blood cries out</l>
<l rend="i0">"For vengeance!" and again his lifted arm</l>
<l rend="i4">Threatened the Sorcerer,</l>
<l rend="i4">Again withheld it felt</l>
<l rend="i0">The barrier that no human strength could burst.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Thou dost not aim the blow more eagerly,"</l>
<l rend="i0">Okba replied, "than I would rush to meet it!</l>
<l rend="i4">"But that were poor revenge.</l>
<l rend="i4">"O Thalaba, thy God</l>
<l rend="i4">"Wreaks on the innocent head</l>
<l rend="i0">"His vengeance;... I must suffer in my child!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Why dost thou pause to strike thy victim? Allah</l>
<l rend="i4">"Permits, commands the deed."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"Liar!" quoth Thalaba.</l>
<l rend="i4">And Laila's wondering eye</l>
<l rend="i0">Looked up, all anguish to her Father's face,</l>
<l rend="i0">"By Allah and the Prophet," he replied,</l>
<l rend="i4">"I speak the words of truth.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Misery, misery,</l>
<l rend="i0">"That I must beg mine enemy to speed</l>
<l rend="i0">"The inevitable vengeance now so near!</l>
<l rend="i2">"I read it in her horoscope,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Her birth-star warned me of Hodeirah's race.</l>
<l rend="i0">"I laid a spell, and called a Spirit up.</l>
<l rend="i4">"He answered one must die</l>
<l rend="i4">"Laila or Thalaba....</l>
<l rend="i2">"Accursed Spirit! even in truth</l>
<l rend="i4">"Giving a lying hope!</l>
<l rend="i2">"Last, I ascended the seventh Heaven</l>
<l rend="i0">"And on the everlasting<ptr target="#FNanchor_169_169"/> Table there</l>
<l rend="i4">"In characters of light,</l>
<l rend="i4">"I read her written doom.</l>
<l rend="i0">"The years that it has gnawn me! and the load</l>
<l rend="i0">"Of sin that it has laid upon my soul!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Curse on this hand that in the only hour</l>
<l rend="i4">"The favouring stars allowed</l>
<l rend="i2">"Reeked with other blood than thine.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Still dost thou stand and gaze incredulous?</l>
<l rend="i0">"Young man, be merciful, and keep her not</l>
<l rend="i4">"Longer in agony!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Thalaba's unbelieving frown</l>
<l rend="i4">Scowled on the Sorcerer,</l>
<l rend="i0">When in the air the rush of wings was heard</l>
<l rend="i4">And Azrael stood among them.</l>
<l rend="i2">In equal terror at the sight</l>
<l rend="i2">The Enchanter, the Destroyer stood,</l>
<l rend="i4">And Laila, the victim maid.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Son of Hodeirah!" said the Angel of Death,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The accursed fables not.</l>
<l rend="i2">"When from the Eternal Hand I took</l>
<l rend="i4">"The yearly<ptr target="#FNanchor_170_170"/> scroll of fate,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Her name was written there.</l>
<l rend="i2">"This is the hour, and from thy hands</l>
<l rend="i0">"Commissioned to receive the Maid I come."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Hear me O Angel!" Thalaba replied,</l>
<l rend="i4">"To avenge my Father's death,</l>
<l rend="i4">"To work the will of Heaven,</l>
<l rend="i0">"To root from earth the accursed sorcerer race,</l>
<l rend="i2">"I have dared danger undismayed,</l>
<l rend="i2">"I have lost all my soul held dear,</l>
<l rend="i0">"I am cut off from all the ties of life,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Unmurmuring; for whate'er awaits me still,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Pursuing to the end the enterprize,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Peril or pain, I bear a ready heart.</l>
<l rend="i2">"But strike this Maid! this innocent!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Angel, I dare not do it."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Remember," answered Azrael, "all thou sayest</l>
<l rend="i0">"Is written down for judgement! every word</l>
<l rend="i0">"In the balance of<ptr target="#FNanchor_171_171"/> thy trial must be weighed!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"So be it!" said the Youth.</l>
<l rend="i0">"He who can read the secrets of the heart</l>
<l rend="i2">"Will judge with righteousness!</l>
<l rend="i4">"This is no doubtful path,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The voice of God within me cannot lie....</l>
<l rend="i2">"I will not harm the innocent."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">He said, and from above,</l>
<l rend="i2">As tho' it were the Voice of Night,</l>
<l rend="i4">The startling answer came.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Son of Hodeirah, think again!</l>
<l rend="i4">"One must depart from hence,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Laila, or Thalaba;</l>
<l rend="i2">"She dies for thee, or thou for her,</l>
<l rend="i4">"It must be life for life!</l>
<l rend="i2">"Son of Hodeirah, weigh it well,</l>
<l rend="i4">"While yet the choice is thine!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">He hesitated not,</l>
<l rend="i0">But looking upward spread his hands to Heaven,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Oneiza, in thy bower of Paradise</l>
<l rend="i4">"Receive me, still unstained!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"What!" exclaimed Okba, "darest thou disobey,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Abandoning all claim</l>
<l rend="i4">"To Allah's longer aid?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">The eager exultation of his speech</l>
<l rend="i0">Earthward recalled the thoughts of Thalaba.</l>
<l rend="i0">"And dost thou triumph, Murderer? dost thou deem</l>
<l rend="i0">"Because I perish, that the unsleeping lids</l>
<l rend="i0">"Of Justice shall be closed upon thy crime?</l>
<l rend="i0">"Poor, miserable man! that thou canst live</l>
<l rend="i0">"With such beast-blindness in the present joy</l>
<l rend="i2">"When o'er thy head the sword of God</l>
<l rend="i4">"Hangs for the certain stroke!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Servant of Allah, thou hast disobeyed,</l>
<l rend="i4">"God hath abandoned thee,</l>
<l rend="i4">"This hour is mine!" cried Okba,</l>
<l rend="i4">And shook his Daughter off,</l>
<l rend="i2">And drew the dagger from his vest.</l>
<l rend="i4">And aimed the deadly blow.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">All was accomplished. Laila rushed between</l>
<l rend="i4">To save the saviour Youth.</l>
<l rend="i0">She met the blow and sunk into his arms,</l>
<l rend="i0">And Azrael from the hands<ptr target="#FNanchor_172_172"/> of Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i4">Received her parting soul.</l></lg>

<div type="book"><head>THE ELEVENTH BOOK.</head><lg>
<l rend="i2">O fool to think thy human hand</l>
<l rend="i0">Could check the chariot-wheels of Destiny</l>
<l rend="i0">To dream of weakness in the all-knowing Mind</l>
<l rend="i4">That his decrees should change!</l>
<l rend="i2">To hope that the united Powers</l>
<l rend="i4">Of Earth, and Air, and Hell,</l>
<l rend="i0">Might blot one letter from the Book of Fate,</l>
<l rend="i0">Might break one link of the eternal chain!</l>
<l rend="i0">Thou miserable, wicked, poor old man,</l>

<l rend="i4">And call on Hell to aid,</l>
<l rend="i4">And call on Heaven to send</l>
<l rend="i4">Its merciful thunderbolt!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">The young Arabian silently</l>
<l rend="i4">Beheld his frantic grief.</l>
<l rend="i2">The presence of the hated youth</l>
<l rend="i4">To raging anguish stung</l>
<l rend="i4">The wretched Sorcerer.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Aye! look and triumph!" he exclaimed,</l>
<l rend="i2">"This is the justice of thy God!</l>
<l rend="i2">"A righteous God is he, to let</l>
<l rend="i0">"His vengeance fall upon the innocent head!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Curse thee, curse thee, Thalaba!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">All feelings of revenge</l>
<l rend="i4">Had left Hodeirah's son.</l>
<l rend="i2">Pitying and silently he heard</l>
<l rend="i0">The victim of his own iniquities,</l>
<l rend="i4">Not with the busy hand</l>
<l rend="i0">Of Consolation, fretting the sore wound</l>
<l rend="i4">He could not hope to heal.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">So as the Servant of the Prophet stood,</l>
<l rend="i2">With sudden motion the night air</l>
<l rend="i2">Gently fanned his cheek.</l>
<l rend="i4">'Twas a Green Bird whose wings</l>
<l rend="i4">Had waved the quiet air.</l>
<l rend="i4">On the hand of Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i4">The Green Bird perched, and turned</l>
<l rend="i2">A mild eye up, as if to win</l>
<l rend="i4">The Adventurer's confidence.</l>
<l rend="i2">Then springing on flew forward,</l>
<l rend="i4">And now again returns</l>
<l rend="i4">To court him to the way;</l>
<l rend="i4">And now his hand perceives</l>
<l rend="i0">Her rosy feet press firmer, as she leaps</l>
<l rend="i4">Upon the wing again.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Obedient to the call,</l>
<l rend="i0">By the pale moonlight Thalaba pursued</l>
<l rend="i4">O'er trackless snows his way;</l>
<l rend="i0">Unknowing he what blessed messenger</l>
<l rend="i4">Had come to guide his steps,</l>
<l rend="i0">That Laila's Spirit went before his path.</l>
<l rend="i0">Brought up in darkness and the child of sin,</l>
<l rend="i0">Yet as the meed of spotless innocence,</l>
<l rend="i0">Just Heaven permitted her by one good deed</l>
<l rend="i0">To work her own redemption, after death;</l>
<l rend="i4">So till the judgement day</l>
<l rend="i4">She might abide in bliss,</l>
<l rend="i0">Green<ptr target="#FNanchor_173_173"/> warbler of the Bowers of Paradise.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The morning sun came forth,</l>
<l rend="i4">Wakening no eye to life</l>
<l rend="i4">In this wide solitude;</l>
<l rend="i0">His radiance with a saffron hue, like heat,</l>
<l rend="i4">Suffused the desert snow.</l>
<l rend="i2">The Green Bird guided Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i0">Now oaring with slow wing her upward way,</l>
<l rend="i2">Descending now in slant descent</l>
<l rend="i2">On out-spread pinions motionless,</l>
<l rend="i0">Floating now with rise and fall alternate,</l>
<l rend="i2">As if the billows of the air</l>
<l rend="i2">Heaved her with their sink and swell.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">And when, beneath the noon,</l>
<l rend="i2">The icey glitter of the snow</l>
<l rend="i4">Dazzled his aching sight,</l>
<l rend="i0">Then on his arm alighted the Green Bird</l>
<l rend="i4">And spread before his eyes</l>
<l rend="i2">Her plumage of refreshing hue.</l>
<l rend="i2">Evening came on; the glowing clouds</l>
<l rend="i0">Tinged with a purple ray the mountain ridge</l>
<l rend="i2">That lay before the Traveller.</l>
<l rend="i4">Ah! whither art thou gone,</l>
<l rend="i0">Guide and companion of the youth, whose eye</l>
<l rend="i2">Has lost thee in the depth of Heaven?</l>
<l rend="i4">Why hast thou left alone</l>
<l rend="i0">The weary wanderer in the wilderness?</l>
<l rend="i2">And now the western clouds grow pale</l>
<l rend="i0">And Night descends upon his solitude.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The Arabian youth knelt down,</l>
<l rend="i2">And bowed his forehead to the ground</l>
<l rend="i4">And made his evening prayer.</l>
<l rend="i0">When he arose the stars were bright in heaven,</l>
<l rend="i2">The sky was blue, and the cold Moon</l>
<l rend="i4">Shone over the cold snow.</l>
<l rend="i4">A speck in the air!</l>
<l rend="i2">Is it his guide that approaches?</l>
<l rend="i2">For it moves with the motion of life!</l>
<l rend="i0">Lo! she returns and scatters from her pinions</l>
<l rend="i0">Odours diviner than the gales of morning</l>
<l rend="i4">Waft from Sabea.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Hovering before the youth she hung,</l>
<l rend="i0">Till from her rosy feet that at his touch</l>
<l rend="i4">Uncurled their grasp, he took</l>
<l rend="i4">The fruitful bough they bore.</l>
<l rend="i2">He took and tasted, a new life</l>
<l rend="i2">Flowed thro' his renovated frame;</l>
<l rend="i2">His limbs that late were sore and stiff</l>
<l rend="i2">Felt all the freshness of repose,</l>
<l rend="i4">His dizzy brain was calmed.</l>
<l rend="i2">The heavy aching of his lids</l>
<l rend="i4">At once was taken off,</l>
<l rend="i0">For Laila from the Bowers of Paradise</l>
<l rend="i4">Had borne the healing<ptr target="#FNanchor_174_174"/> fruit.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">So up the mountain steep</l>
<l rend="i4">With untired foot he past,</l>
<l rend="i4">The Green Bird guiding him</l>
<l rend="i4">Mid crags, and ice, and rocks,</l>
<l rend="i0">A difficult way, winding the long ascent.</l>
<l rend="i0">How then the heart of Thalaba rejoiced</l>
<l rend="i2">When bosomed in the mountain depths,</l>
<l rend="i0">A sheltered Valley opened on his view!</l>
<l rend="i4">It was the Simorg's vale,</l>
<l rend="i2">The dwelling of the ancient Bird.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">On a green and mossy bank.</l>
<l rend="i4">Beside a rivulet</l>
<l rend="i4">The Bird of Ages stood.</l>
<l rend="i0">No sound intruded on his solitude,</l>
<l rend="i2">Only the rivulet was heard</l>
<l rend="i4">Whose everlasting flow</l>
<l rend="i2">From the birth-day of the world had made</l>
<l rend="i2">The same unvaried murmuring.</l>
<l rend="i4">Here dwelt the all-knowing Bird</l>
<l rend="i4">In deep tranquillity,</l>
<l rend="i4">His eyelids ever closed</l>
<l rend="i0">In full enjoyment of profound repose.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Reverently the youth approached</l>
<l rend="i4">That old and only<ptr target="#FNanchor_175_175"/> Bird,</l>
<l rend="i2">And crossed his arms upon his breast,</l>
<l rend="i4">And bowed his head and spake.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Earliest of existing things,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Earliest thou, and wisest thou,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Guide me, guide me, on my way!</l>
<l rend="i4">"I am bound to seek the caverns</l>
<l rend="i4">"Underneath the roots of Ocean</l>
<l rend="i4">"Where the Sorcerer brood are nurst.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Thou the eldest, thou the wisest,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Guide me, guide me, on my way!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">The ancient Simorg on the youth</l>
<l rend="i4">Unclosed his thoughtful eyes,</l>
<l rend="i4">And answered to his prayer.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Northward by the stream proceed,</l>
<l rend="i2">"In the fountain of the rock</l>
<l rend="i2">"Wash away thy worldly stains,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Kneel thou there, and seek the Lord</l>
<l rend="i2">"And fortify thy soul with prayer.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Thus prepared ascend the Sledge,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Be bold, be wary, seek and find!</l>
<l rend="i4">"God hath appointed all."</l>
<l rend="i0">The ancient Simorg then let fall his lids</l>
<l rend="i4">Returning to repose.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Northward along the rivulet</l>
<l rend="i4">The adventurer went his way,</l>
<l rend="i0">Tracing its waters upward to their source.</l>
<l rend="i4">Green Bird of Paradise</l>
<l rend="i4">Thou hast not left the youth;...</l>
<l rend="i4">With slow associate flight</l>
<l rend="i4">She companies his way,</l>
<l rend="i0">And now they reach the fountain of the rock.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">There in the cold clear well</l>
<l rend="i0">Thalaba washed away his earthly stains,</l>
<l rend="i2">And bowed his face before the Lord,</l>
<l rend="i2">And fortified his soul with prayer.</l>
<l rend="i4">The while upon the rock</l>
<l rend="i4">Stood the celestial Bird,</l>
<l rend="i0">And pondering all the perils he must pass,</l>
<l rend="i2">With a mild melancholy eye</l>
<l rend="i4">Beheld the youth beloved.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">And lo! beneath yon lonely pine, the sledge....</l>
<l rend="i2">And there they stand the harnessed Dogs,</l>
<l rend="i2">Their wide eyes watching for the youth,</l>
<l rend="i0">Their ears erected turned towards his way.</l>
<l rend="i2">They were lean as lean might be,</l>
<l rend="i2">Their furrowed ribs rose prominent,</l>
<l rend="i2">And they were black from head to foot,</l>
<l rend="i2">Save a white line on every breast</l>
<l rend="i4">Curved like the crescent moon.</l>
<l rend="i2">And he is seated in the sledge,</l>
<l rend="i2">His arms are folded on his breast,</l>
<l rend="i4">The bird is on his knees;</l>
<l rend="i2">There is fear in the eyes of the Dogs,</l>
<l rend="i2">There is fear in their pitiful moan,</l>
<l rend="i4">And now they turn their heads,</l>
<l rend="i4">And seeing him there, Away!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">The Youth with the start of their speed</l>
<l rend="i2">Falls back to the bar of the sledge,</l>
<l rend="i0">His hair floats straight in the stream of the wind</l>
<l rend="i2">Like the weeds in the running brook.</l>
<l rend="i2">They wind with speed the upward way,</l>
<l rend="i2">An icey path thro' rocks of ice,</l>
<l rend="i2">His eye is at the summit now,</l>
<l rend="i2">And thus far all is dangerless,</l>
<l rend="i4">And now upon the height</l>
<l rend="i4">The black Dogs pause and pant,</l>
<l rend="i2">They turn their eyes to Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i4">As if to plead for pity,</l>
<l rend="i4">They moan and moan with fear.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Once more away! and now</l>
<l rend="i4">The long descent is seen,</l>
<l rend="i4">A long, long, narrow path.</l>
<l rend="i2">Ice-rocks aright and hills of snow,</l>
<l rend="i2">Aleft the giddy precipice.</l>
<l rend="i2">Be firm, be firm, O Thalaba!</l>
<l rend="i4">One motion now, one bend,</l>
<l rend="i4">And on the crags below</l>
<l rend="i0">Thy shattered flesh will harden in the frost.</l>
<l rend="i2">Why howl the Dogs so mournfully?</l>
<l rend="i2">And wherefore does the blood flow fast</l>
<l rend="i2">All purple o'er their sable hair?</l>
<l rend="i2">His arms are folded on his breast,</l>
<l rend="i4">Nor scourge nor goad has he,</l>
<l rend="i4">No hand appears to strike,</l>
<l rend="i4">No sounding lash is heard:</l>
<l rend="i2">But piteously they moan and moan</l>
<l rend="i4">And track their way with blood.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">And lo! on yonder height</l>
<l rend="i4">A giant Fiend aloft</l>
<l rend="i0">Waits to thrust down the tottering Avalanche!</l>
<l rend="i2">If Thalaba looks back he dies,</l>
<l rend="i2">The motion of fear is death.</l>
<l rend="i2">On ... on ... with swift and steady pace</l>
<l rend="i4">Adown that dreadful way!</l>
<l rend="i2">The youth is firm, the Dogs are fleet,</l>
<l rend="i4">The Sledge goes rapidly,</l>
<l rend="i2">The thunder of the avalanche</l>
<l rend="i4">Re-echoes far behind.</l>
<l rend="i2">On ... on ... with swift and steady pace</l>
<l rend="i4">Adown that dreadful way!</l>
<l rend="i2">The Dogs are fleet, the way is steep</l>
<l rend="i4">The Sledge goes rapidly,</l>
<l rend="i4">They reach the plain below.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">A wide, wide plain, all desolate,</l>
<l rend="i4">Nor tree, nor bush, nor herb!</l>
<l rend="i2">On go the Dogs with rapid step,</l>
<l rend="i2">The Sledge slides after rapidly,</l>
<l rend="i4">And now the Sun went down.</l>
<l rend="i2">They stopt and looked at Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i4">The Youth performed his prayer;</l>
<l rend="i2">They knelt beside him as he prayed</l>
<l rend="i4">They turned their heads to Mecca</l>
<l rend="i4">And tears ran down their cheeks.</l>
<l rend="i2">Then down they laid them in the snow</l>
<l rend="i4">As close as they could lie,</l>
<l rend="i4">They laid them down and slept.</l>
<l rend="i4">And backward in the sledge</l>
<l rend="i4">The Adventurer laid him down,</l>
<l rend="i2">There peacefully slept Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i2">And the Green Bird of Paradise</l>
<l rend="i4">Lay in his bosom warm.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">The Dogs awoke him at the dawn,</l>
<l rend="i4">They knelt and wept again;</l>
<l rend="i2">Then rapidly they journeyed on,</l>
<l rend="i2">And still the plain was desolate,</l>
<l rend="i4">Nor tree, nor bush, nor herb!</l>
<l rend="i2">And ever at the hour of prayer</l>
<l rend="i4">They stopt, and knelt, and wept;</l>
<l rend="i2">And still that green and graceful Bird</l>
<l rend="i2">Was as a friend to him by day,</l>
<l rend="i2">And ever when at night he slept</l>
<l rend="i4">Lay in his bosom warm.</l>
<l rend="i2">In that most utter solitude</l>
<l rend="i4">It cheered his heart to hear</l>
<l rend="i4">Her soft and soothing voice;</l>
<l rend="i4">Her voice was soft and sweet,</l>
<l rend="i2">It swelled not with the blackbird's thrill,</l>
<l rend="i0">Nor warbled rich like the dear bird, that holds</l>
<l rend="i4">The solitary man</l>
<l rend="i0">A loiterer in his thoughtful walk at eve;</l>
<l rend="i2">But if no overflowing joy</l>
<l rend="i2">Spake in its tones of tenderness</l>
<l rend="i4">They soothed the softened soul.</l>
<l rend="i2">Her bill was not the beak of blood;</l>
<l rend="i0">There was a human meaning in her eye,</l>
<l rend="i0">Its mild affection fixed on Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i4">Woke wonder while he gazed</l>
<l rend="i0">And made her dearer for the mystery.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Oh joy! the signs of life appear,</l>
<l rend="i4">The first and single Fir</l>
<l rend="i0">That on the limits of the living world</l>
<l rend="i4">Strikes in the ice its roots.</l>
<l rend="i2">Another, and another now;</l>
<l rend="i2">And now the Larch that flings its arms</l>
<l rend="i2">Down arching like the falling wave;</l>
<l rend="i2">And now the Aspin's scattered leaves</l>
<l rend="i2">Grey glitter on the moveless twig;</l>
<l rend="i2">The Poplar's varying verdure now,</l>
<l rend="i2">And now the Birch so beautiful,</l>
<l rend="i4">Light as a Lady's plumes.</l>
<l rend="i2">Oh joy! the signs of life! the Deer</l>
<l rend="i2">Hath left his slot beside the way;</l>
<l rend="i2">The little Ermine now is seen</l>
<l rend="i4">White wanderer of the snow;</l>
<l rend="i2">And now from yonder pines they hear</l>
<l rend="i2">The clatter of the Grouse's wings:</l>
<l rend="i2">And now the snowy Owl pursues</l>
<l rend="i2">The Traveller's sledge in hope of food;</l>
<l rend="i2">And hark! the rosy-breasted bird</l>
<l rend="i4">The Throstle of sweet song!</l>
<l rend="i2">Joy! joy! the winter-wilds are left!</l>
<l rend="i2">Green bushes now and greener grass,</l>
<l rend="i2">Red thickets here all berry-bright,</l>
<l rend="i4">And here the lovely flowers!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">When the last morning of their way arrived,</l>
<l rend="i4">After the early prayer,</l>
<l rend="i2">The Green Bird fixed on Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i2">A sad and supplicating eye,</l>
<l rend="i2">And with a human voice she spake,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Servant of God, I leave thee now.</l>
<l rend="i2">"If rightly I have guided thee,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Give me the boon I beg!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"O gentle Bird," quoth Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Guide and companion of my dangerous way,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Friend and sole solace of my solitude,</l>
<l rend="i0">"How can I pay thee benefits like these!</l>
<l rend="i2">"Ask what thou wilt that I can give,</l>
<l rend="i2">"O gentle Bird, the poor return</l>
<l rend="i4">"Will leave me debtor still!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"Son of Hodeirah!" she replied,</l>
<l rend="i0">"When thou shalt see an Old Man crushed beneath</l>
<l rend="i0">"The burthen of his earthly punishment,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Forgive him, Thalaba!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Yea, send a prayer to God on his behalf!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">A flush o'erspread the young Destroyer's cheek,</l>
<l rend="i2">He turned his eye towards the Bird</l>
<l rend="i0">As if in half repentance; for he thought</l>
<l rend="i0">Of Okba; and his Father's dying groan</l>
<l rend="i0">Came on his memory. The celestial Bird</l>
<l rend="i4">Saw and renewed her speech.</l>
<l rend="i0">"O Thalaba, if she who in thine arms</l>
<l rend="i0">"Received the dagger-blow and died for thee,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Deserve one kind remembrance ... save, O save</l>
<l rend="i0">"The Father that she loved from endless death!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Laila! and is it thou?" the youth replied:</l>
<l rend="i0">"What is there that I durst refuse to thee?</l>
<l rend="i0">"This is no time to harbour in my heart</l>
<l rend="i0">"One evil thought ... here I put off revenge,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The last rebellious feeling ... be it so!</l>
<l rend="i0">"God grant to me the pardon that I need</l>
<l rend="i4">"As I do pardon him!</l>
<l rend="i2">"But who am I that I should save</l>
<l rend="i4">"The sinful soul alive?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Enough!" said Laila. "When the hour shall come</l>
<l rend="i2">"Remember me! my task is done.</l>
<l rend="i2">"We meet again in Paradise!"</l>
<l rend="i0">She said and shook her wings, and up she soared</l>
<l rend="i0">With arrow-swiftness thro' the heights of Heaven.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">His aching eye pursued her path,</l>
<l rend="i2">When starting onward went the Dogs,</l>
<l rend="i2">More rapidly they hurried on</l>
<l rend="i4">In hope of near repose.</l>
<l rend="i2">It was the early morning yet</l>
<l rend="i2">When by the well-head of a brook</l>
<l rend="i4">They stopt, their journey done.</l>
<l rend="i2">The spring was clear, the water deep,</l>
<l rend="i2">A venturous man were he and rash</l>
<l rend="i4">That should have probed its depths,</l>
<l rend="i2">For all its loosened bed below</l>
<l rend="i4">Heaved strangely up and down,</l>
<l rend="i2">And to and fro, from side to side</l>
<l rend="i4">It heaved, and waved, and tossed,</l>
<l rend="i4">And yet the depths were clear,</l>
<l rend="i2">And yet no ripple wrinkled o'er</l>
<l rend="i4">The face of that fair Well.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">And on that Well so strange and fair</l>
<l rend="i4">A little boat there lay,</l>
<l rend="i2">Without on oar, without a sail,</l>
<l rend="i2">One only seat it had, one seat</l>
<l rend="i2">As if for only Thalaba.</l>
<l rend="i2">And at the helm a Damsel stood</l>
<l rend="i2">A Damsel bright and bold of eye,</l>
<l rend="i2">Yet did a maiden modesty</l>
<l rend="i4">Adorn her fearless brow.</l>
<l rend="i2">She seemed sorrowful, but sure</l>
<l rend="i4">More beautiful for sorrow.</l>
<l rend="i2">To her the Dogs looked wistful up,</l>
<l rend="i4">And then their tongues were loosed,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Have we done well, O Mistress dear!</l>
<l rend="i4">"And shall our sufferings end?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">The gentle Damsel made reply,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Poor Servants of the God I serve,</l>
<l rend="i2">"When all this witchery is destroyed</l>
<l rend="i4">"Your woes will end with mine.</l>
<l rend="i2">"A hope, alas! how long unknown!</l>
<l rend="i4">"This new adventurer gives:</l>
<l rend="i2">"Now God forbid that he, like you,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Should perish for his fears!</l>
<l rend="i2">"Poor Servants of the God I serve</l>
<l rend="i4">"Wait ye the event in peace."</l>
<l rend="i0">A deep and total slumber as she spake</l>
<l rend="i0">Seized them. Sleep on, poor sufferers! be at rest!</l>
<l rend="i0">Ye wake no more to anguish. Ye have borne</l>
<l rend="i0">The Chosen, the Destroyer! soon his hand</l>
<l rend="i4">Shall strike the efficient blow,</l>
<l rend="i0">Soon shaking off your penal forms shall ye</l>
<l rend="i0">With songs of joy amid the Eden groves</l>
<l rend="i4">Hymn the Deliverer's praise!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Then did the Damsel say to Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i2">"The morn is young, the Sun is fair</l>
<l rend="i2">"And pleasantly thro' pleasant banks</l>
<l rend="i4">"The quiet brook flows on....</l>
<l rend="i4">"Wilt thou embark with me?</l>
<l rend="i2">"Thou knowest not the water's way,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Think Stranger well! and night must come,...</l>
<l rend="i4">"Wilt thou embark with me?</l>
<l rend="i2">"Thro' fearful perils thou must pass,...</l>
<l rend="i2">"Stranger, the oppressed ask thine aid!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Thou wilt embark with me!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">She smiled in tears upon the youth,...</l>
<l rend="i2">What heart were his who could gainsay</l>
<l rend="i4">That melancholy smile?</l>
<l rend="i2">"Sail on, sail on," quoth Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Sail on, in Allah's name!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">He sate him on the single seat,</l>
<l rend="i4">The little boat moved on.</l>
<l rend="i2">Thro' pleasant banks the quiet brook</l>
<l rend="i4">Went winding pleasantly;</l>
<l rend="i2">By fragrant fir groves now it past,</l>
<l rend="i4">And now thro' alder-shores,</l>
<l rend="i2">Thro' green and fertile meadows now</l>
<l rend="i4">It silently ran by.</l>
<l rend="i2">The flag-flower blossomed on its side,</l>
<l rend="i4">The willow tresses waved,</l>
<l rend="i2">The flowing current furrowed round</l>
<l rend="i2">The water-lilly's floating leaf,</l>
<l rend="i2">The fly of green and gauzy wing</l>
<l rend="i4">Fell sporting down its course.</l>
<l rend="i2">And grateful to the voyager</l>
<l rend="i2">The freshness of the running stream,</l>
<l rend="i4">The murmur round the prow.</l>
<l rend="i2">The little boat falls rapidly</l>
<l rend="i4">Adown the rapid brook.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">But many a silent spring meantime,</l>
<l rend="i4">And many a rivulet</l>
<l rend="i4">Had swoln the growing brook,</l>
<l rend="i2">And when the southern Sun began</l>
<l rend="i2">To wind the downward way of heaven,</l>
<l rend="i2">It ran a river deep and wide</l>
<l rend="i4">Thro' banks that widened still.</l>
<l rend="i2">Then once again the Damsel spake,</l>
<l rend="i2">"The stream is strong, the river broad,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Wilt thou go on with me?</l>
<l rend="i2">"The day is fair but night must come....</l>
<l rend="i4">"Wilt thou go on with me?</l>
<l rend="i2">"Far far away the mourner's eye</l>
<l rend="i2">"Is watching; for our little boat....</l>
<l rend="i4">"Thou wilt go on with me!"</l>
<l rend="i2">"Sail on, sail on," quoth Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Sail on, in Allah's name!"</l>
<l rend="i2">The little boat falls rapidly</l>
<l rend="i4">Adown the river-stream.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">A broader and a broader stream.</l>
<l rend="i4">That rocked the little boat!</l>
<l rend="i2">The Cormorant stands upon its shoals,</l>
<l rend="i4">His black and dripping wings</l>
<l rend="i4">Half opened to the wind.</l>
<l rend="i2">The Sun goes down, the crescent Moon</l>
<l rend="i2">Is brightening in the firmament;</l>
<l rend="i4">And what is yonder roar</l>
<l rend="i2">That sinking now and swelling now,</l>
<l rend="i4">But roaring, roaring still,</l>
<l rend="i4">Still louder, louder, grows?</l>
<l rend="i2">The little boat falls rapidly</l>
<l rend="i4">Adown the rapid tide,</l>
<l rend="i4">The Moon is bright above,</l>
<l rend="i0">And the wide Ocean opens on their way!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Then did the Damsel speak again</l>
<l rend="i4">"Wilt thou go on with me?</l>
<l rend="i2">"The Moon is bright, the sea is calm</l>
<l rend="i2">"And I know well the ocean-paths;...</l>
<l rend="i4">"Wilt thou go on with me?</l>
<l rend="i2">"Deliverer! yes! thou dost not fear!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Thou wilt go on with me!"</l>
<l rend="i2">"Sail on, sail on!" quoth Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i4">"Sail on, in Allah's name!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">The Moon is bright, the sea is calm,</l>
<l rend="i2">The little boat rides rapidly</l>
<l rend="i4">Across the ocean waves;</l>
<l rend="i2">The line of moonlight on the deep</l>
<l rend="i2">Still follows as they voyage on;</l>
<l rend="i4">The winds are motionless;</l>
<l rend="i2">The gentle waters gently part</l>
<l rend="i4">In murmurs round the prow.</l>
<l rend="i2">He looks above, he looks around,</l>
<l rend="i2">The boundless heaven, the boundless sea,</l>
<l rend="i2">The crescent moon, the little boat,</l>
<l rend="i4">Nought else above, below.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">The Moon is sunk, a dusky grey</l>
<l rend="i4">Spreads o'er the Eastern sky,</l>
<l rend="i4">The Stars grow pale and paler;</l>
<l rend="i2">Oh beautiful! the godlike Sun</l>
<l rend="i4">Is rising o'er the sea!</l>
<l rend="i2">Without an oar, without a sail</l>
<l rend="i2">The little boat rides rapidly;...</l>
<l rend="i2">Is that a cloud that skirts the sea?</l>
<l rend="i4">There is no cloud in heaven!</l>
<l rend="i2">And nearer now, and darker now....</l>
<l rend="i4">It is ... it is ... the Land!</l>
<l rend="i2">For yonder are the rocks that rise</l>
<l rend="i4">Dark in the reddening morn,</l>
<l rend="i2">For loud around their hollow base</l>
<l rend="i4">The surges rage and roar.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">The little boat rides rapidly,</l>
<l rend="i2">And now with shorter toss it heaves</l>
<l rend="i4">Upon the heavier swell;</l>
<l rend="i4">And now so near they see</l>
<l rend="i2">The shelves and shadows of the cliff,</l>
<l rend="i4">And the low-lurking rocks</l>
<l rend="i2">O'er whose black summits hidden-half</l>
<l rend="i4">The shivering billows burst.</l>
<l rend="i0">And nearer now they feel the breaker's spray.</l>
<l rend="i0">Then spake the Damsel, "yonder is our path</l>
<l rend="i4">"Beneath the cavern arch.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Now is the ebb, and till the ocean-flow</l>
<l rend="i2">"We cannot over-ride the rocks.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Go thou and on the shore</l>
<l rend="i0">"Perform thy last ablutions, and with prayer</l>
<l rend="i0">"Strengthen thy heart.... I too have need to pray."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">She held the helm with steady hand</l>
<l rend="i4">Amid the stronger waves,</l>
<l rend="i4">Thro' surge and surf she drove,</l>
<l rend="i4">The adventurer leapt to land.</l></lg>
</div>

<div type="book"><head>THE TWELFTH BOOK.</head>
<lg>
<l rend="i0">Then Thalaba drew off Abdaldar's ring,</l>
<l rend="i0">And cast it in the sea, and cried aloud,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Thou art my shield, my trust, my hope, O God!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Behold and guard me now,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Thou who alone canst save.</l>
<l rend="i0">"If from my childhood up, I have looked on</l>
<l rend="i0">"With exultation to my destiny,</l>
<l rend="i0">"If, in the hour of anguish, I have felt</l>
<l rend="i0">"The justice of the hand that chastened me,</l>
<l rend="i0">"If, of all selfish passions purified,</l>
<l rend="i0">"I go to work thy will, and from the world</l>
<l rend="i4">"Root up the ill-doing race,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Lord! let not thou the weakness of my arm</l>
<l rend="i4">"Make vain the enterprize!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">The Sun was rising all magnificent,</l>
<l rend="i0">Ocean and Heaven rejoicing in his beams.</l>
<l rend="i4">And now had Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i0">Performed his last ablutions, and he stood</l>
<l rend="i2">And gazed upon the little boat</l>
<l rend="i4">Riding the billows near,</l>
<l rend="i0">Where, like a sea-bird breasting the broad waves,</l>
<l rend="i2">It rose and fell upon the surge;</l>
<l rend="i0">Till from the glitterance of the sunny main</l>
<l rend="i4">He turned his aching eyes,</l>
<l rend="i0">And then upon the beach he laid him down</l>
<l rend="i4">And watched the rising tide.</l>
<l rend="i0">He did not pray, he was not calm for prayer;</l>
<l rend="i0">His spirit troubled with tumultuous hope</l>
<l rend="i4">Toiled with futurity.</l>
<l rend="i2">His brain, with busier workings, felt</l>
<l rend="i0">The roar and raving of the restless sea,</l>
<l rend="i0">The boundless waves that rose and rolled and rocked;</l>
<l rend="i4">The everlasting sound</l>
<l rend="i0">Opprest him, and the heaving infinite,</l>
<l rend="i4">He closed his lids for rest.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Meantime with fuller reach and stronger swell</l>
<l rend="i4">Wave after wave advanced;</l>
<l rend="i0">Each following billow lifted the last foam</l>
<l rend="i0">That trembled on the sand with rainbow hues;</l>
<l rend="i0">The living flower, that, rooted to the rock,</l>
<l rend="i2">Late from the thinner element</l>
<l rend="i0">Shrunk down within its purple stem to sleep,</l>
<l rend="i2">Now feels the water, and again</l>
<l rend="i4">Awakening blossoms out</l>
<l rend="i4">All its green anther-necks.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Was there a Spirit in the gale</l>
<l rend="i4">That fluttered o'er his cheek?</l>
<l rend="i0">For it came on him like the gentle sun</l>
<l rend="i0">That plays and dallies o'er the night-closed flower,</l>
<l rend="i0">And woos it to unfold anew to joy;</l>
<l rend="i0">For it came on him as the dews of eve</l>
<l rend="i2">Descend with healing and with life</l>
<l rend="i4">Upon the summer mead;</l>
<l rend="i0">Or liker the first sound of seraph song</l>
<l rend="i4">And Angel hail, to him</l>
<l rend="i0">Whose latest sense had shuddered at the groan</l>
<l rend="i0">Of anguish, kneeling by his death bed-side.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">He starts and gazes round to seek</l>
<l rend="i0">The certain presence. "Thalaba!" exclaimed</l>
<l rend="i4">The Voice of the Unseen;...</l>
<l rend="i0">"Father of my Oneiza!" he replied,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And have thy years been numbered? art thou too</l>
<l rend="i2">"Among the Angels?" "Thalaba!"</l>
<l rend="i0">A second and a dearer voice repeats,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Go in the favour of the Lord</l>
<l rend="i4">"My Thalaba go on!</l>
<l rend="i0">"My husband. I have drest our bower of bliss.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Go and perform the work,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Let me not longer suffer hope in heaven!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">He turned an eager glance towards the sea,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Come!" quoth the Damsel, and she drove</l>
<l rend="i4">Her little boat to land.</l>
<l rend="i2">Impatient thro' the rising wave</l>
<l rend="i4">He rushed to meet its way,</l>
<l rend="i0">His eye was bright, his cheek was flushed with joy.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Hast thou had comfort in thy prayers?" she cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Yea," answered Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i0">"A heavenly visitation." "God be praised!"</l>
<l rend="i0">She uttered, "then I do not hope in vain!"</l>
<l rend="i2">And her voice trembled, and her lips</l>
<l rend="i4">Quivered, and tears ran down.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Stranger," quoth she, "in years long past</l>
<l rend="i4">"Was one who vowed himself</l>
<l rend="i2">"The Champion of the Lord like thee</l>
<l rend="i4">"Against the race of Hell.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Young was he, as thyself,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Gentle, and yet so brave!</l>
<l rend="i4">"A lion-hearted man.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Shame on me, Stranger! in the arms of love</l>
<l rend="i0">"I held him from his calling, till the hour</l>
<l rend="i0">"Was past, and then the Angel who should else</l>
<l rend="i2">"Have crowned him with his glory-wreath,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Smote him in anger ... years and years are gone....</l>
<l rend="i0">"And in his place of penance he awaits</l>
<l rend="i0">"Thee the Deliverer, surely thou art he!</l>
<l rend="i2">"It was my righteous punishment</l>
<l rend="i0">"In the same youth unchanged and changeless love,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And fresh affliction and keen penitence</l>
<l rend="i0">"To abide the written hour when I should waft</l>
<l rend="i0">"The doomed Destroyer and Deliverer here.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Remember thou that thy success involves</l>
<l rend="i0">"No single fate, no common misery."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">As thus she spake, the entrance of the cave</l>
<l rend="i4">Darkened the boat below.</l>
<l rend="i4">Around them from their nests,</l>
<l rend="i4">The screaming sea-birds fled.</l>
<l rend="i4">Wondering at that strange shape</l>
<l rend="i0">Yet unalarmed at sight of living man,</l>
<l rend="i0">Unknowing of his sway and power misused;</l>
<l rend="i4">The clamours of their young</l>
<l rend="i4">Echoed in shriller yells</l>
<l rend="i0">That rung in wild discordance round the rock.</l>
<l rend="i4">And farther as they now advanced</l>
<l rend="i0">The dim reflection of the darkened day</l>
<l rend="i4">Grew fainter, and the dash</l>
<l rend="i0">Of the out-breakers deadened; farther yet</l>
<l rend="i4">And yet more faint the gleam,</l>
<l rend="i0">And there the waters at their utmost bound</l>
<l rend="i0">Silently rippled on the rising rock.</l>
<l rend="i0">They landed and advanced, and deeper in</l>
<l rend="i4">Two adamantine doors</l>
<l rend="i4">Closed up the cavern pass.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Reclining on the rock beside</l>
<l rend="i4">Sate a grey-headed man</l>
<l rend="i4">Watching an hour-glass by.</l>
<l rend="i4">To him the Damsel spake,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Is it the hour appointed?" the old man</l>
<l rend="i4">Nor answered her awhile,</l>
<l rend="i2">Nor lifted he his downward eye,</l>
<l rend="i4">For now the glass ran low,</l>
<l rend="i4">And like the days of age</l>
<l rend="i4">With speed perceivable,</l>
<l rend="i4">The latter sands descend:</l>
<l rend="i4">And now the last are gone.</l>
<l rend="i0">Then he looked up, and raised his arm, and smote</l>
<l rend="i4">The adamantine gates.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The gates of adamant</l>
<l rend="i4">Unfolding at the stroke</l>
<l rend="i0">Opened and gave the entrance. Then She turned</l>
<l rend="i4">To Thalaba and said</l>
<l rend="i4">"Go in the name of God!</l>
<l rend="i0">"I cannot enter,... I must wait the end</l>
<l rend="i4">"In hope and agony.</l>
<l rend="i2">"God and Mohammed prosper thee,</l>
<l rend="i4">"For thy sake and for ours!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">He tarried not,... he past</l>
<l rend="i0">The threshold, over which was no return.</l>
<l rend="i2">All earthly thoughts, all human hopes</l>
<l rend="i4">And passions now put off,</l>
<l rend="i4">He cast no backward glance</l>
<l rend="i4">Towards the gleam of day.</l>
<l rend="i4">There was a light within,</l>
<l rend="i0">A yellow light, as when the autumnal Sun</l>
<l rend="i4">Through travelling rain and mist</l>
<l rend="i4">Shines on the evening hills.</l>
<l rend="i2">Whether from central fires effused,</l>
<l rend="i2">Or if the sunbeams day by day,</l>
<l rend="i0">From earliest generations, there absorbed,</l>
<l rend="i0">Were gathering for the wrath-flame. Shade was</l>
<l rend="i4">In those portentous vaults;</l>
<l rend="i0">Crag overhanging, nor the column-rock</l>
<l rend="i4">Cast its dark outline there.</l>
<l rend="i0">For with the hot and heavy atmosphere</l>
<l rend="i0">The light incorporate, permeating all,</l>
<l rend="i0">Spread over all its equal yellowness.</l>
<l rend="i0">There was no motion in the lifeless air,</l>
<l rend="i2">He felt no stirring as he past</l>
<l rend="i4">Adown the long descent,</l>
<l rend="i0">He heard not his own footsteps on the rock</l>
<l rend="i0">That thro' the thick stagnation sent no sound.</l>
<l rend="i4">How sweet it were, he thought,</l>
<l rend="i4">To feel the flowing wind!</l>
<l rend="i4">With what a thirst of joy</l>
<l rend="i0">He should breathe in the open gales of heaven!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Downward and downward still, and still the way,</l>
<l rend="i4">The long, long, way is safe.</l>
<l rend="i4">Is there no secret wile</l>
<l rend="i4">No lurking enemy?</l>
<l rend="i0">His watchful eye is on the wall of rock,...</l>
<l rend="i2">And warily he marks the roof</l>
<l rend="i4">And warily surveyed</l>
<l rend="i4">The path that lay before.</l>
<l rend="i0">Downward and downward still, and still the way,</l>
<l rend="i4">The long, long, way is safe;</l>
<l rend="i4">Rock only, the same light,</l>
<l rend="i4">The same dead atmosphere,</l>
<l rend="i0">And solitude, and silence like the grave.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">At length the long descent</l>
<l rend="i4">Ends on a precipice;</l>
<l rend="i0">No feeble ray entered its dreadful gulphs,</l>
<l rend="i4">For in the pit profound</l>
<l rend="i4">Black Darkness, utter Night,</l>
<l rend="i4">Repelled the hostile gleam,</l>
<l rend="i0">And o'er the surface the light atmosphere</l>
<l rend="i4">Floated and mingled not.</l>
<l rend="i0">Above the depth four overawning wings,</l>
<l rend="i4">Unplumed and huge and strong,</l>
<l rend="i4">Bore up a little car;</l>
<l rend="i0">Four living pinions, headless, bodyless,</l>
<l rend="i2">Sprung from one stem that branched below</l>
<l rend="i4">In four down-arching limbs,</l>
<l rend="i0">And clenched the car-rings endlong and aside</l>
<l rend="i4">With claws of griffin grasp.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">But not on these, the depths so terrible,</l>
<l rend="i0">The wonderous wings, fixed Thalaba his eye,</l>
<l rend="i4">For there upon the brink,</l>
<l rend="i0">With fiery fetters fastened to the rock,</l>
<l rend="i0">A man, a living man, tormented lay,</l>
<l rend="i0">The young Othatha; in the arms of love,</l>
<l rend="i0">He who had lingered out the auspicious hour</l>
<l rend="i4">Forgetful of his call.</l>
<l rend="i0">In shuddering pity Thalaba exclaimed</l>
<l rend="i0">"Servant of God, can I not succour thee?"</l>
<l rend="i2">He groaned and answered, "Son of Man,</l>
<l rend="i0">"I sinned and am tormented; I endure</l>
<l rend="i4">"In patience and in hope.</l>
<l rend="i0">"The hour that shall destroy the Race of Hell,</l>
<l rend="i4">"That hour shall set me free."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"Is it not come?" quoth Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Yea! by this omen." And with fearless hand</l>
<l rend="i0">He grasped the burning fetters, "in the name</l>
<l rend="i4">"Of God!" and from the rock</l>
<l rend="i0">Rooted the rivets, and adown the gulph</l>
<l rend="i2">Hurled them. The rush of flames roared up,</l>
<l rend="i2">For they had kindled in their fall</l>
<l rend="i0">The deadly vapours of the pit profound,</l>
<l rend="i0">And Thalaba bent on and looked below.</l>
<l rend="i4">But vainly he explored</l>
<l rend="i4">The deep abyss of flame</l>
<l rend="i0">That sunk beyond the plunge of mortal eye,</l>
<l rend="i0">Now all ablaze as if infernal fires</l>
<l rend="i4">Illumed the world beneath.</l>
<l rend="i2">Soon was the poison-fuel spent,</l>
<l rend="i4">The flame grew pale and dim,</l>
<l rend="i0">And dimmer now it fades and now is quenched,</l>
<l rend="i4">And all again is dark,</l>
<l rend="i4">Save where the yellow air</l>
<l rend="i0">Enters a little in and mingles slow.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Meantime the freed Othatha clasped his knees</l>
<l rend="i2">And cried, "Deliverer!" struggling then</l>
<l rend="i0">With joyful hope, "and where is she," he cried,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Whose promised coming for so many a year...."</l>
<l rend="i4">"Go!" answered Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i4">"She waits thee at the gates."</l>
<l rend="i2">"And in thy triumph," he replied,</l>
<l rend="i0">"There thou wilt join us?" the Deliverer's eye</l>
<l rend="i2">Glanced on the abyss, way else was none....</l>
<l rend="i2">The depth was unascendable.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Await not me," he cried,</l>
<l rend="i0">"My path hath been appointed, go ... embark!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Return to life,... live happy!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">OTHATHA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i12">But thy name,...</l><l rend="i0">That thro' the nations we may blazon it,</l>
<l rend="i0">That we may bless thee.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i10">Bless the Merciful!</l></lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Then Thalaba pronounced the name of God</l>
<l rend="i4">And leapt into the car.</l>
<l rend="i4">Down, down, it sunk,... down down....</l>
<l rend="i4">He neither breathes nor sees;</l>
<l rend="i2">His eyes are closed for giddiness</l>
<l rend="i2">His breath is sinking with the fall.</l>
<l rend="i2">The air that yields beneath the car</l>
<l rend="i4">Inflates the wings above.</l>
<l rend="i4">Down ... down ... a mighty depth!...</l>
<l rend="i0">And was the Simorgh with the Powers of ill</l>
<l rend="i4">Associate to destroy?</l>
<l rend="i2">And was that lovely mariner</l>
<l rend="i4">A fiend as false as fair?</l>
<l rend="i4">For still he sinks down ... down....</l>
<l rend="i2">But ever the uprushing wind</l>
<l rend="i4">Inflates the wings above,</l>
<l rend="i4">And still the struggling wings</l>
<l rend="i4">Repel the rushing wind.</l>
<l rend="i4">Down ... down ... and now it strikes.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">He stands and totters giddily,</l>
<l rend="i4">All objects round, awhile,</l>
<l rend="i4">Float dizzy on his sight.</l>
<l rend="i0">Collected soon he gazes for the way.</l>
<l rend="i0">There was a distant light that led his search;</l>
<l rend="i4">The torch a broader blaze,</l>
<l rend="i0">The unpruned taper flames a longer flame,</l>
<l rend="i0">But this was fierce as is the noon-tide sun,</l>
<l rend="i0">So in the glory of its rays intense</l>
<l rend="i4">It quivered with green glow.</l>
<l rend="i4">Beyond was all unseen,</l>
<l rend="i4">No eye could penetrate</l>
<l rend="i0">That unendurable excess of light.</l>
<l rend="i0">It veiled no friendly form, thought Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i4">And wisely did he deem,</l>
<l rend="i0">For at the threshold of the rocky door,</l>
<l rend="i0">Hugest and fiercest of his kind accurst,</l>
<l rend="i2">Fit warden of the sorcery gate</l>
<l rend="i4">A rebel Afreet lay.</l>
<l rend="i0">He scented the approach of human food</l>
<l rend="i0">And hungry hope kindled his eye of flame.</l>
<l rend="i0">Raising his hand to save the dazzled sense</l>
<l rend="i4">Onward held Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i0">And lifted still at times a rapid glance.</l>
<l rend="i4">Till, the due distance gained,</l>
<l rend="i4">With head abased, he laid</l>
<l rend="i4">The arrow in its rest.</l>
<l rend="i0">With steady effort and knit forehead then,</l>
<l rend="i4">Full on the painful light</l>
<l rend="i0">He fixed his aching eye, and loosed the bow.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">An anguish yell ensued,</l>
<l rend="i0">And sure no human voice had scope or power</l>
<l rend="i4">For that prodigious shriek</l>
<l rend="i0">Whose pealing echoes thundered up the rock.</l>
<l rend="i4">Dim grew the dying light,</l>
<l rend="i0">But Thalaba leapt onward to the doors</l>
<l rend="i4">Now visible beyond,</l>
<l rend="i0">And while the Afreet warden of the way</l>
<l rend="i0">Was writhing with his death-pangs, over him</l>
<l rend="i4">Sprung and smote the stony doors,</l>
<l rend="i0">And bade them in the name of God give way.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">The dying Fiend beneath him at that name</l>
<l rend="i4">Tossed in worse agony,</l>
<l rend="i0">And the rocks shuddered, and the rocky doors</l>
<l rend="i0">Rent at the voice asunder. Lo ... within....</l>
<l rend="i4">The Teraph and the fire,</l>
<l rend="i2">And Khawla, and in mail complete</l>
<l rend="i4">Mohareb for the strife.</l>
<l rend="i2">But Thalaba with numbing force</l>
<l rend="i2">Smites his raised arm, and rushes by,</l>
<l rend="i0">For now he sees the fire amid whose flames</l>
<l rend="i0">On the white ashes of Hodeirah lies</l>
<l rend="i4">Hodeirah's holy Sword.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">He rushes to the fire,</l>
<l rend="i4">Then Khawla met the youth</l>
<l rend="i0">And leapt upon him, and with clinging arms</l>
<l rend="i0">Clasps him, and calls Mohareb now to aim</l>
<l rend="i0">The effectual vengeance. O fool! fool! he sees</l>
<l rend="i0">His Father's Sword, and who shall bar his way?</l>
<l rend="i0">Who stand against the fury of that arm</l>
<l rend="i4">That spurns her to the earth?</l>
<l rend="i0">She rises half, she twists around his knees,</l>
<l rend="i2">A moment ... and he vainly strives</l>
<l rend="i4">To shake her from her hold,</l>
<l rend="i0">Impatient then into her cursed breast</l>
<l rend="i4">He stamps his crushing heel,</l>
<l rend="i0">And from her body, heaving now in death</l>
<l rend="i4">Springs forward to the Sword.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The co-existent flame</l>
<l rend="i0">Knew the Destroyer; it encircled him,</l>
<l rend="i0">Rolled up his robe and gathered round his head,</l>
<l rend="i0">Condensing to intenser splendour there,</l>
<l rend="i0">His crown of glory and his light of life</l>
<l rend="i4">Hovered the irradiate wreath.</l>
<l rend="i0">The moment Thalaba had laid his hand</l>
<l rend="i4">Upon his Father's Sword,</l>
<l rend="i0">The Living Image in the inner cave</l>
<l rend="i0">Smote the Round Altar. The Domdaniel rocked</l>
<l rend="i4">Thro' all its thundering vaults;</l>
<l rend="i0">Over the surface of the reeling Earth</l>
<l rend="i4">The alarum shock was felt:</l>
<l rend="i0">The Sorcerer brood, all, all, where'er dispersed,</l>
<l rend="i0">Perforce obeyed the summons; all, they came</l>
<l rend="i4">Compelled by Hell and Heaven,</l>
<l rend="i4">By Hell compelled to keep</l>
<l rend="i4">Their baptism-covenant,</l>
<l rend="i2">And with the union of their strength</l>
<l rend="i0">Oppose the common danger; forced by Heaven</l>
<l rend="i4">To share the common doom.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Vain are all spells! the Destroyer</l>
<l rend="i4">Treads the Domdaniel floor.</l>
<l rend="i0">They crowd with human arms and human force</l>
<l rend="i4">To crush the single foe;</l>
<l rend="i4">Vain is all human force!</l>
<l rend="i4">He wields his Father's Sword,</l>
<l rend="i0">The vengeance of awakened Deity!</l>
<l rend="i0">But chief on Thalaba Mohareb prest,</l>
<l rend="i2">The language of the inspired Witch</l>
<l rend="i2">Announced one fatal blow for both,</l>
<l rend="i0">And desperate of self-safety, yet he hoped</l>
<l rend="i0">To serve the cause of Eblis, and uphold</l>
<l rend="i4">His empire true in death.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Who shall withstand his way?</l>
<l rend="i0">Scattered before the sword of Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i4">The sorcerer throng recede</l>
<l rend="i0">And leave him space for combat. Wretched man</l>
<l rend="i0">What shall the helmet or the shield avail</l>
<l rend="i0">Against Almighty anger! wretched man,</l>
<l rend="i0">Too late Mohareb finds that he has chosen</l>
<l rend="i2">The evil part! he rears his shield</l>
<l rend="i4">To meet the Arabian's sword,...</l>
<l rend="i0">Under the edge of that fire-hardened steel</l>
<l rend="i2">The shield falls severed; his cold arm</l>
<l rend="i4">Rings with the jarring blow,...</l>
<l rend="i4">He lifts his scymetar,</l>
<l rend="i0">A second stroke, and lo! the broken hilt</l>
<l rend="i4">Hangs from his palsied hand!</l>
<l rend="i2">And now he bleeds! and now he flies!</l>
<l rend="i0">And fain would hide himself amid the throng,</l>
<l rend="i2">But they feel the sword of Hodeirah,</l>
<l rend="i2">But they also fly from the ruin!</l>
<l rend="i2">And hasten to the inner cave,</l>
<l rend="i4">And fall all fearfully</l>
<l rend="i2">Around the Giant Idol's feet,</l>
<l rend="i0">Seeking salvation from the Power they served.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">It was a Living Image, by the art</l>
<l rend="i0">Of magic hands of flesh and bones composed,</l>
<l rend="i0">And human blood thro' veins and arteries</l>
<l rend="i0">That flowed with vital action. In the shape</l>
<l rend="i4">Of Eblis it was made,</l>
<l rend="i2">Its stature such and such its strength</l>
<l rend="i2">As when among the Sons of God</l>
<l rend="i0">Pre-eminent, he raised his radiant head,</l>
<l rend="i2">Prince of the Morning. On his brow</l>
<l rend="i2">A coronet of meteor flames,</l>
<l rend="i4">Flowing in points of light.</l>
<l rend="i4">Self-poised in air before him,</l>
<l rend="i0">Hung the Round Altar, rolling like the World</l>
<l rend="i0">On its diurnal axis, like the World</l>
<l rend="i4">Checquered with sea and shore,</l>
<l rend="i4">The work of Demon art.</l>
<l rend="i0">For where the sceptre in the Idol's hand</l>
<l rend="i0">Touched the Round Altar, in its answering realm</l>
<l rend="i0">Earth felt the stroke, and Ocean rose in storms,</l>
<l rend="i0">And ruining Cities shaken from their seat</l>
<l rend="i4">Crushed all their habitants.</l>
<l rend="i0">His other arm was raised, and its spread palm</l>
<l rend="i4">Up-bore the ocean-weight</l>
<l rend="i0">Whose naked waters arched the sanctuary,</l>
<l rend="i4">Sole prop and pillar he.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Fallen on the ground around his feet</l>
<l rend="i0">The Sorcerers lay. Mohareb's quivering arms</l>
<l rend="i4">Clung to the Idol's knees;</l>
<l rend="i4">The Idol's face was pale</l>
<l rend="i2">And calm in terror he beheld</l>
<l rend="i2">The approach of the Destroyer.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Sure of his stroke, and therefore in pursuit</l>
<l rend="i0">Following, nor blind, nor hasty on his foe,</l>
<l rend="i0">Moved the Destroyer. Okba met his way,</l>
<l rend="i4">Of all that brotherhood</l>
<l rend="i0">He only fearless, miserable man,</l>
<l rend="i4">The one that had no hope.</l>
<l rend="i0">"On me, on me," the childless Sorcerer cried,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Let fall the weapon! I am he who stole</l>
<l rend="i0">"Upon the midnight of thy Father's tent,</l>
<l rend="i0">"This is the hand that pierced Hodeirah's heart,</l>
<l rend="i0">"That felt thy brethren's and thy sister's blood</l>
<l rend="i0">"Gush round the dagger-hilt. Let fall on me</l>
<l rend="i0">"The fated sword! the vengeance hour is come!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Destroyer, do thy work!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Nor wile, nor weapon, had the desperate wretch,</l>
<l rend="i2">He spread his bosom to the stroke.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Old man, I strike thee not!" said Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The evil thou hast done to me and mine</l>
<l rend="i2">"Brought its own bitter punishment.</l>
<l rend="i0">"For thy dear Daughter's sake I pardon thee,</l>

I have placed a scripture phrase in the mouth of a
Mohammedan; but it is a saying of Job, and there can
be no impropriety in making a modern Arab speak
like an ancient one. Resignation is particularly inculcated
by Mohammed, and of all his precepts it is that
which his followers have best observed: it is even the
vice of the East. It had been easy to have made
Zeinab speak from the Koran, if the tame language of
the Koran could be remembered by the few who have
toiled through its dull tautology. I thought it better to
express a feeling of religion in that language with which
our religious ideas are connected.</p>

A waste of ornament and labour characterises all the
works of the Orientalists. I have seen illuminated
Persian manuscripts that must each have been the
toil of many years, every page painted, not with representations
of life and manners, but usually like the
curves and lines of a Turkey carpet, conveying no idea
whatever, as absurd to the eye as nonsense-verses to the
ear. The little of their literature that has reached us
is equally worthless. Our <hi rend="italic">barbarian</hi> scholars have called
Ferdusi the Oriental Homer. We have a specimen of
his poem; the translation is said to be bad, and certainly
must be unfaithful, for it is in rhyme; but the vilest
copy of a picture at least represents the subject and the
composition. To make this Iliad of the East, as they
have sacrilegiously stiled it, a good poem, would be realizing
the dreams of Alchemy, and transmuting lead into
gold.

The Arabian Tales certainly abound with genius;
they have lost their metaphorical rubbish in passing

those Arabian Kings who reigned at Hirah. A single
stone fastened the whole structure; the colour of the
walls varied frequently in a day. Nôman richly rewarded
the architect Sennamar; but recollecting afterwards
that he might build palaces equal, or superior
in beauty for his rival kings, ordered that he should be
thrown from the highest tower of the edifice.

               <p part="N"> The tribe of Ad were descended from Ad, the son of
Aus or Uz, the son of Irem, the son of Shem, the son
of Noah, who after the confusion of tongues, settled in
Al Ahkâf, or the winding sands, in the province of
Hadramaut, where his posterity greatly multiplied.
Their first King was Shedad, the son of Ad, of whom
the eastern writers deliver many fabulous things, particularly
that he finished the magnificent city his
father had begun, wherein he built a fine palace,
adorned with delicious gardens, to embellish which he
spared neither cost nor labour, proposing thereby to
create in his subjects a superstitious veneration of himself
as a God. This garden or paradise was called the
garden of Irem, and is mentioned in the Koran, and
often alluded to by the Oriental writers. The city they
tell us, is still standing in the desarts of Aden, being
preserved by providence as a monument of divine
justice, though it be invisible, unless very rarely, when
God permits it to be seen: a favour one Colabah pretended
to have received in the reign of the Khalif Moâwiyah,
who sending for him to know the truth of the
matter, Colabah related his whole adventure; that is he
was seeking a Camel he had lost, he found himself on a
sudden at the gates of this city, and entering it, saw not
one inhabitant, at which being terrified, he stayed no
longer than to take with him some fine stones which he
shewed the Khalif.

               </p>
               <p part="N">
The descendants of Ad in process of time falling from
the worship of the true God into idolatry, God sent the
prophet Houd (who is generally agreed to be Heber) to
preach the unity of his essence and reclaim them. Houd
preached for many years to this people without effect,
till God at last was weary of waiting for their repentance.
The first punishment which he inflicted was a famine of
three years continuance, during all which time the heavens
were closed upon them. This, with the evils which
it caused, destroyed a great part of this people, who were
then the richest and most powerful of all in Arabia.
</p>
               <p part="N">
The Adites seeing themselves reduced to this extremity,
and receiving no succour from their false Gods, resolved
to make a pilgrimage to a place in the province of
Hegiaz, where at present Mecca is situated. There was
then a hillock of red sand there, around which a great
concourse of different people might always be seen; and
all these nations, the faithful as well as the unfaithful,
believed that by visiting this spot with devotion,
they should obtain from God whatever they petitioned
for, respecting the wants and necessities of life.
</p>
               <p part="N">
The Adites having then resolved to undertake this religious
journey, chose seventy men, at whose head they
appointed Mortadh and Kail, the two most considerable
personages of the country, to perform this duty in the
name of the whole nation, and by this means procure
rain from Heaven, without which their country must be
ruined. The deputees departed, and were hospitably
received by Moâwiyah, who at that time reigned in the
province of Hegiaz. They explained to him the occasion
of their journey, and demanded leave to proceed and
perform their devotions at the Red Hillock, that they
might procure rain.
</p>
               <p part="N">
Mortadh, who was the wisest of this company, and
who had been converted by the Prophet Houd, often
remonstrated with his associates that it was useless to
to take this journey for the purpose of praying at this
chosen spot, unless they had previously adopted the
truths which the Prophet preached, and seriously
repented of their unbelief. For how, said he, can you
hope that God will shed upon us the abundant showers
of his mercy, if we refuse to hear the voice of him whom
he hath sent to instruct us?
</p>
               <p part="N">
Kail who was one of the most obstinate in error,
and consequently of the Prophets worst enemies, hearing
the discourses of his colleague, requested King Moâwiyah
to detain Mortadh prisoner, whilst he and the
remainder of his companions proceeded to make their
prayers upon the Hillock. Moâwiyah consented, and
detaining Mortadh captive, permitted the others to pursue
their journey and accomplish their vow.
</p>
               <p part="N">
Kail, now the sole chief of the deputation, having arrived
at the place, prayed thus, Lord give to the people of Ad
such rains as it shall please thee. And he had scarcely
finished when there appeared three clouds in the sky,
one white, one red, the third black. At the same time
these words were heard to proceed from Heaven, chuse
which of the three thou wilt. Kail chose the black,
which he imagined the fullest, and most abundant in
water, of which they were in extreme want. After having
chosen, he immediately quitted the place and took
the road to his own country, congratulating himself on
the happy success of his pilgrimage.
</p>
               <p part="N">
As soon as Kail arrived in the valley of Magaith, a part of
the territory of the Adites, he informed his countrymen
of the favourable answer he had received, and of the
cloud which was soon to water all their lands. The
senseless people all came out of their houses to receive it,
but this cloud, which was big with the divine vengeance
produced only a wind, most cold and most violent,
which the Arabs call Sarsar; it continued to blow for
seven days and seven nights, and exterminated all the unbelievers
of the country, leaving only the Prophet Houd
alive, and those who had heard him and turned to the
faith.

Greaves, that which is confessed by the Arabian writers
to be the most probable relation, as is reported by Ibn Abd
Alhokm, whose words out of the Arabick are these. "the
greatest part of chronologers agree, that he which built
the Pyramids, was, Saurid Ibn Salhouk, King of Egypt,
who lived three hundred years before the flood. The occasion
of this was, because he saw in his sleep, that the
whole earth was turned over with the inhabitants of it,
the men lying upon their faces, and the stars falling down
and striking one another, with a terrible noise; and being
troubled, he concealed it. After this he saw the fixed
stars falling to the earth, in the similitude of white fowl,
and they snatched up men, carrying them between two
great mountains; and these mountains closed upon them,
and the shining stars were made dark. Awaking with
great fear, he assembles the chief priests of all the provinces
of Egypt, an hundred and thirty priests, the chief of
them was called Aclimum. Relating the whole matter
to them, they took the altitude of the stars, and making
their prognostication, foretold of a deluge. The King
said, will it come to our country? they answered, yea,
and will destroy it. And there remained a certain number
of years for to come, and he commanded in the mean
space to build the Pyramids, and a vault to be made, into
which the river Nilus entering should run into the countries
of the west, and into the land Al-Said. And he
filled them with <hi rend="italic">telesmes</hi>,<ref style="inner" target="#Footnote_b">

After he had given order for this building, they
cut out vast columns and wonderful stones. They fetch
massy stones from the Æthopians, and made with these
the foundation of the three Pyramids, fastening them together
with lead and iron. They built the gates of them
forty cubits under ground, and they made the height of
the Pyramids one hundred royal cubits, which are fifty
of ours in these times; he also made each side of them
an hundred royal cubits. The beginning of this building
was in a fortunate horoscope. After that he had finished
it, he covered it with coloured satten from the top to the
bottom; and he appointed a solemn festival, at which were
present all the inhabitants of his kingdom. Then he
built in the western Pyramid thirty treasures, filled with
store of riches, and utensils, and with signatures made
of precious stones, and with instruments of iron, and
vessels of earth, and with arms that rust not, and with
glass which might be bended and yet not broken, and
with several kind of alakakirs, single and double, and with
deadly poisons, and with other things besides. He made
also in the east Pyramid divers celestial spheres and stars,
and what they severally operate in their aspects, and
the perfumes which are to be used to them, and the
books which treat of these matters. He also put in the
coloured Pyramid the commentaries of the Priests, in
chests of black marble, and with every Priest a book, in
which were the wonders of his profession, and of his
actions, and of his nature, and what was done in his
time, and what is, and what shall be, from the beginning
of time to the end of it. He placed in every Pyramid a
treasurer. The treasurer of the westerly Pyramid was a
statue of marble stone, standing upright with a lance,
and upon his head a serpent wreathed. He that came
near it, and stood still, the serpent bit him of one side,
and wreathing round about his throat and killing him,
returned to his place. He made the treasurer of the
east Pyramid, an idol of black agate, his eyes open
and shining, sitting upon a throne with a lance; when
any looked upon him, he heard of one side of him a
voice, which took away his sense, so that he fell prostrate
upon his face, and ceased not till he died. He
made the treasurer of the coloured Pyramid a statue of
stone, called <hi rend="italic">Albut</hi>, sitting: he which looked towards
it was drawn by the statue, till he stuck to it, and
could not be separated from it, till such time as he died.
The Coptites write in their books, that there is an inscription
engraven upon them, the exposition of which
in Arabick is this, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallcap">King Saurid</hi> built the Pyramids in
such and such a time, and finished them in six years: he
that comes after me, and says that he is equal to me, let him
destroy them in six hundred years; and yet it is known,
that it is easier to pluck down, than to build up: I also
covered them, when I had finished them, with satten; and
let him cover them with mats. After that <hi rend="smallcap">Almamon</hi> the
Calif entered Ægypt, and saw the Pyramids. He desired
to know what was within, and therefore would
have them opened. They told him it could not possibly
be done. He replied I will have it certainly done. And
that hole was opened for him, which stands open to
this day, with fire and vinegar. Two smiths prepared
and sharpened the iron and engines, which they forced
in, and there was a great expence in the opening of it.
The thickness of the wall was found to be twenty cubits;
and when they came to the end of the wall, behind the
place they had digged, there was an ewer of green
emerald; in it were a thousand dinars very
weighty, every dinar was an ounce of our ounces: they
wondered at it, but knew not the meaning of it. Then
<hi rend="smallcap">Almamon</hi> said, cast up the account, how much hath
been spent in making the entrance; they cast it up, and
lo it was the same sum which they found, it neither
exceeded nor was defective. Within they found a square
well, in the square of it there were doors, every door
opened into a house (or vault) in which there were dead
bodies wrapped up in linen. They found towards the
top of the Pyramid, a chamber, in which there was an
hollow stone: in it was a statue of stone like a man, and
within it a man, upon whom was a breast-plate of gold
set with jewels; upon his breast was a sword of invaluable
price, and at his head a carbuncle of the bigness
of an egg, shining like the light of the day; and upon
him were characters written with a pen, no man knows
what they signify. After <hi rend="smallcap">Almamon</hi> had opened it, men
entered into it for many years, and descended by the
slippery passage which is in it; and some of them came
out safe, and others died."

"Whilst the King was at Bologna a stone wonderful
in its species and nature was brought to him from the
East Indies, by a man unknown, who appeared by his
manners to be a Barbarian. It sparkled as tho' all burning
with an incredible splendour, flashing radiance, and
shooting on every side its beams, it filled the surrounding
air to a great distance with a light scarcely by any
eyes endurable. In this also it was wonderful, that
being most impatient of the earth, if it was confined, it
would force its way and immediately fly aloft; neither
could it be contained by any art of man in a narrow
place, but appeared only to love those of ample extent.
It was of the utmost purity stained by no soil nor spot.
Certain shape it had none, for its figure was inconstant
and momentarily changing, and tho' at a distance it was
beautiful to the eye, it would not suffer itself to be
handled with impunity, but hurt those who obstinately
struggled with it, as many persons before many spectators
experienced. If by chance any part of it was
broken off, for it was not very hard, it become nothing
less.

A pleasant and elevated spot being fixed upon, Shuddaud
dispatched an hundred chiefs to collect skilful
artists and workmen from all countries. He also commanded
the monarchs of Syria and Ormus to send him
all their jewels and precious stones. Forty camel loads
of gold, silver, and jewels, were daily used in the building,
which contained a thousand spacious quadrangles
of many thousand rooms. In the areas were artificial
trees of gold and silver, whose leaves were emeralds,
and fruit clusters of pearls and jewels. The ground
was strewed with ambergris, musk, and saffron. Between
every two of the artificial trees was planted one
of delicious fruit. This romantic abode took up five
hundred years in the completion. When finished,
Shuddaud marched to view it; and, when arrived near,
divided two hundred thousand youthful slaves, whom he
had brought with him from Damascus, into four detachments,
which were stationed in cantonments prepared
for their reception on each side of the garden, towards
which he proceeded with his favourite courtiers. Suddenly
was heard in the air a voice like thunder, and
Shuddaud looking up, beheld a personage of majestic
figure and stern aspect, who said, "I am the Angel
of Death, commissioned to seize thy impure soul."
</p>
               <p part="N">
Shuddaud exclaimed, "give me leisure to enter the
garden," and was descending from his horse, when the
seizer of life snatched away his impure spirit, and he fell
dead upon the ground. At the same time lightnings flashed
and destroyed the whole army of the infidel; and
the rose garden of Irim became concealed from the sight
of man.</p>

more magnificent and more perfect, in the architecture,
in the ornaments and in the furniture. All the guests
contented themselves with expressing their admiration,

This man spoke very freely to the Prince and said to
him, I find a great defect in this building, it is, that
the foundation is not good, nor the walls sufficiently
strong, so that Azrael can enter on every side, and the
Sarsar can easily pass thro'. And when they showed
him the walls of the Palace ornamented with azure and
gold, of which the marvellous workmanship surpassed
in costliness the richness of the materials, he replied,
there is still a great inconvenience here! it is that we
can never estimate these works well, till we are laid
backwards. Signifying by these words that we never
understand these things rightly, till we are upon our
death-bed, when we discover their vanity.

Their heat is sometimes so excessive that it is difficult to
form any idea of its violence without having experienced
it; but it may be compared to the heat of a large oven
at the moment of drawing out the bread. When these
winds begin to blow, the atmosphere assumes an alarming
aspect. The sky at other times so clear, in this
climate, becomes dark and heavy; the sun loses his
splendour and appears of a violet colour. The air is not
cloudy, but grey and thick, and is in fact filled with an
extremely subtile dust, which penetrates every where.
This wind, always light and rapid, is not at first remarkably
hot, but it increases in heat in proportion as it continues.
All animated bodies soon discover it, by the
change it produces in them. The lungs which a too
rarefied air no longer expands, are contracted and become
painful. Respiration is short and difficult, the
skin parched and dry, and the body consumed by an internal
heat. In vain is recourse had to large draughts of
water; nothing can restore perspiration. In vain is coolness
sought for; all bodies in which it is usual to find it,
deceives the hand that touches them. Marble, iron,
water, notwithstanding the sun no longer appears, are
hot. The streets are deserted, and the dead silence of night
reigns every where. The inhabitants of houses and villages
shut themselves up in their houses, and those of
the desert in their tents, or in pits they dig in the earth,
where they wait the termination of this destructive heat.
It usually lasts three days, but if it exceeds that time it
becomes insupportable. Woe to the traveller whom this
wind surprizes remote from shelter! he must suffer all its
dreadful consequences which sometimes are mortal.
The danger is most imminent when it blows in squalls,
for then the rapidity of the wind increases the heat to such
degree as to cause sudden death. This death is a real
suffocation; the lungs being empty, are convulsed, the
circulation disordered, and the whole mass of blood
driven by the heart towards the head and breast; whence
that hæmorrhage at the nose and mouth which happens
after death. This wind is especially fatal to persons of a
plethoric habit, and those in whom fatigue has destroyed
the tone of the muscles and the vessels. The corpse remains
a long time warm, swells, turns blue and is easily
separated; all which are signs of that putrid fermentation
which takes place in animal bodies when the
humours become stagnant. These accidents are to be
avoided by stopping the nose and mouth with handkerchiefs;
an efficacious method likewise is that practised
by the camels, who bury their noses in the sand and keep
them there till the squall is over.
</p>
               <p part="N">
Another quality of this wind is its extreme aridity;
which is such, that water sprinkled on the floor evaporates
in a few minutes. By this extreme dryness it
withers and strips all the plants, and by exhaling too suddenly
the emanations from animal bodies, crisps the
skin, closes the pores, and causes that feverish heat
which is the invariable effect of suppressed perspiration.

In supernatural affairs dogs seem to possess a sedative
virtue. When peace was made, about the year 1170,
between the Earls of Holland, and Flanders, "it was
concluded that Count Floris should send unto Count
Philip, a thousand men, expert in making of ditches,
to stop the hole which had beene made neere unto Dam,
or the Sluce, whereby the countrey was drowned round
about at everie high sea; the which the Flemings
could by no meanes fil up, neither with wood, nor any
other matter, for that all sunke as in a gulfe without
any bottome; whereby, in succession of time, Bruges
and all that jurisdiction, had been in danger to have bin
lost by inundation, and to become all sea, if it were not
speedily repaired. Count Floris having taken possession
of the isle of Walchran, returned into Holland, from
whence hee sent the best workmen he could find in all
his countries, into Flanders, to make dikes and causeies,
and to stop the hole neere unto this Dam, or Sluce,
and to recover the drowned land. These diggers being
come to the place, they found at the entrie of this
bottomlesse hole a Sea-dog, the which for six dayes together,
did nothing but crie out and howle very fearefully.
They, not knowing what it might signifie,
having consulted of this accident, they resolved to cast
this dogge into the hole. There was a mad-headed
Hollander among the rest, who going into the bottome
of the dike, tooke the dogge by the taile, and cast him
into the middest of the gulfe; then speedily they cast
earth and torfe into it, so as they found a bottome,
and by little and little filled it up. And for that many
workemen came to the repairing of this dike, who for
that they would not be far from their worke, coucht in
Cabines, which seemed to be a pretie towne. Count
Philip gave unto all these Hollanders, Zeelanders and
others, that would inhabit there, as much land as
they could recover from Dam to Ardenbourg, for them
and their successors, for ever, with many other immunities
and freedoms. By reason whereof many planted

consists of moveables, of which the following is a

some goats and poultry, a mare and her bridle and saddle,
a tent, a lance sixteen feet long, a crooked sabre, a
rusty musket, with a flint or matchlock; a pipe, a

small coffee roaster, a mat, some clothes, a mantle of
black woollen, and a few glass or silver rings, which the

are wanting, their furniture is complete. But what the
poor man stands most in need of, and what he takes
most pleasure in, is his mare; for this animal is his
principal support. With his mare the Bedouin makes
his excursions against hostile tribes, or seeks plunder in
the country, and on the highways. The mare is preferred
to the horse, because she does not neigh, is more
docile, and yields milk, which on occasion, satisfies the
thirst and even the hunger of her master.

The Shaik, says Volney, with whom I resided in the
country of Gaza, about the end of 1784, passed for one
of the most powerful of those districts; yet it did not
appear to me that his expenditure was greater than that
of an opulent farmer. His personal effects, consisting
in a few pelisses, carpets, arms, horses, and camels,
could not be estimated at more than fifty thousand livres
(a little above two thousand pounds); and it must be
observed that in this calculation four mares of the breed
of racers are valued at six thousand livres, (two hundred
and fifty pounds), and each camel at ten pounds sterling.
We must not therefore, when we speak of the Bedouins,
affix to the words Prince and Lord, the ideas they usually
convey; we should come nearer the truth by comparing
them to substantial farmers, in mountainous countries,
whose simplicity they resemble in their dress as well as
in their domestic life and manners. A Shaik, who has
the command of five hundred horse, does not disdain to
saddle and bridle his own, nor to give him his barley and
chopped straw. In his tent, his wife makes the coffee,
kneeds the dough, and superintends the dressing of the
victuals. His daughters and kinswomen wash the linen,
and go with pitchers on their heads, and veils over their
faces, to draw water from the fountain. These manners
agree precisely with the descriptions in Homer, and the
history of Abraham, in Genesis. But it must be owned
that it is difficult to form a just idea of them without
having ourselves been eye witnesses.

                  <q>I was much amused by observing the dexterity of the
Arab women in baking their bread. They have a small
place built with clay, between two and three feet high,
having a hole at the bottom, for the convenience of
drawing out the ashes, something similar to that of a
lime kiln. The oven (which I think is the most proper
name for this place) is usually about fifteen inches wide at
the top, and gradually grows wider to the bottom. It is
heated with wood, and when sufficiently hot, and
perfectly clear from smoke, having nothing but clear embers
at bottom (which continue to reflect great heat), they
prepare the dough in a large bowl, and mould the cakes
to the desired size on a board or stone placed near the
oven. After they have kneaded the cake to a proper
consistence, they pat it a little, then toss it about with
great dexterity in one hand, till it is as thin as they
choose to make it. They then wet one side of it with
water, at the same time wetting the hand and arm, with
which they put it into the oven. The wet side of the
cake adheres fast to the side of the oven till it is
sufficiently baked when if not paid sufficient attention
to, it would fall down among the embers. If they were
not exceedingly quick at this work, the heat of the oven
would burn the skin from off their hands and arms; but
with such amazing dexterity do they perform it, that
one woman will continue keeping three or four cakes at
a time in the oven till she has done baking. This mode,
let me add, does not require half the fuel that is made
use of in Europe.

built exactly in the fashion of our Churches, where instead
of such Seats and Benches as we make use
of, they only strew the Floor with Mats, upon which
they perform the several sittings and prostrations that are
enjoyned in their religion. Near the middle, particularly
of the principal Mosque of each city, there is a large
pulpit erected, which is ballustraded round, with about
half a dozen steps leading up to it. Upon these (for I
am told none are permitted to enter the pulpit) the
Mufty or one of the Im-ams placeth himself every
Friday, the day of the congregation, as they call it, and
from thence either explaineth some part or other of the
Coran, or else exhorteth the people to piety and good
works. That end of these Mosques, which regards
Mecca, whither they direct themselves throughout the
whole course of their devotions, is called the Kiblah,
in which there is commonly a nich, representing as a
judicious writer conjectures, the presence, and at the
same time the invisibility of the Deity. There is usually
a square tower erected at the other end, with a flag-staff
upon the top of it. Hither the cryer ascends at the
appointed times, and displaying a small flag, advertised
the people with a loud voice, from each side of the
battlements, of the hour of prayer. These places of the
Mahometan worship, together with the Mufty, Im-ams
and other persons belonging to them, are maintained
out of certain revenues arising from the rents of lands
and houses, either left by will or set apart by the public

All the Mosques are built nearly in the same style.
They are of an oblong square form, and covered in the
middle with a large dome, on the top of which is fixed
a gilt crescent. In front there is a handsome portico
covered with several small cupolas, and raised one
step above the pavement of the court. The Turks
sometimes in the hot season, perform their devotions
there; and between the columns, upon cross iron bars,
are suspended a number of lamps, for illuminations on
the Thursday nights and on all festivals. The entrance
into the Mosque is by one large door. All these edifices
are solidly built of freestone, and in several the domes
are covered with lead. The minarets stand on one side
adjoining to the body of the Mosque. They are sometimes
square, but more commonly round and taper,
the gallery for the maazeen, or cryers, projecting a little
from the column near the top, has some resemblance to
a rude capital; and from this the spire tapering more in
proportion than before, soon terminates in a point
crowned with a crescent.

Houses of hair, from the matter they are made of. They
are the same with what the Antients called Mapalia,
which being then, as they are to this day, secured from
the heat and inclemency of the weather, by a covering
only of such hair cloth, as our coal sacks are made of,
might very justly be described by Virgil to have thin
roofs. When we find any number of them together
(and I have seen from 3 to 300) then they are usually
placed in a circle, and constitute a Dou-war. The fashion
of each tent is the same, being of an oblong figure, not
unlike the bottom of a ship turned upside down, as Satlust
hath long ago described them. However they differ
in bigness, according to the number of people who live
in them: and are accordingly supported, some with one
pillar, others with two or three: whilst a curtain or carpet
placed, upon occasion, at each of these divisions,
separateth the whole into so many apartments. The
pillar which I have mentioned, is a straight pole, 8 or
10 feet high and 3 or 4 inches in thickness, serving, not
only to support the tent, but being full of hooks fixd
there for the purpose, the Arabs hang upon it their
cloaths, baskets, saddles, and accoutrements of war.
Holofernes, as we read in Judith, 13. 16. made the like
use of the pillar of his tent, by hanging his fauchin upon
it, it is there called the <hi rend="italic">pillar of the bed</hi>, from the custom
perhaps, that hath always prevailed, of having the upper
end of the carpet, matrass, or whatever else they lie upon,
turned from the skirts of the tent that way. But the
Κωνωπειον,
Canopy as we render it (ver. 9) should I
presume, be rather called the gnat or muskeeta net,
which is a close curtain of gauze or fine linnen, used
all over the Levant, by people of better fashion, to keep
out the flies. The Arabs have nothing of this kind; who
in taking their rest, lie horizontally upon the ground,
without bed, matrass or pillow, wrapping themselves up
only in their <hi rend="italic">Hykes</hi>, and lying, as they find room upon

of which is only seen. These tents are made of twine,
composed of goat's hair, camel's wool, and the leaves
of the wild palm, so that they keep out water; but,
being black, they produce a disagreable effect at a

than one strain, suitable to their homely instruments,
and to their simple invention. The Arabebbah as they
call the bladder and string, is in the highest vogue, and
doubtless of great antiquity, as is also the Gaspah,
which is only a common reed, open at each end, having
the side of it bored, with three or more holes, according
to the ability of the Person who is to touch it: tho' the
compass of their tunes rarely or ever exceeds an octave.
Yet sometimes, even in this simplicity of harmony,
they observe something of method and ceremony, for in
their historical <hi rend="italic">Cantatas</hi> especially, they have their preludes
and symphonies; each stanza being introduced
with a flourish from the Arabebbah, while the narration
itself is accompanied with the softest touches they are
able to make, upon the Gaspah. The Tarr, another of
their instruments, is made like a Sive, consisting (as
Isidore describeth the Tympanum) of a thin rim or hoop
of wood, with a skin of parchment stretched over the
top of it. This serves for the Bass in all their Concerts,
which they accordingly touch very artfully with their
fingers, and the knuckles or palms of their hands, as the
time and measure require, or as force and softness are to
be communicated to the several parts of the performance.
The Tarr is undoubtedly the Tympanum of
the Antients, which appears as well from the general
use of it all over Barbary, Egypt and the Levant, as from
the method of playing upon it, and the figure of the
instrument itself, being exactly of the same fashion,

to say that there are great Poets among them.
Yet I was assured in Yemen that it is not uncommon
to find them among the wandering Arabs in the country
of Dsjâf. It is some few years since a Sheik of these
Arabs was in prison at Sana: seeing by chance a bird
upon a roof opposite to him, he recollected that the
devout Mohammedans believe they perform an action
agreable to God in giving liberty to a bird encaged. He
thought therefore he had as much right to liberty as a
bird, and made a poem upon the subject, which was
first learnt by his guards, and then became so popular
that at last it reached the Imam. He was so pleased
with it that he liberated the Sheik, whom he had arrested
for his robberies.

are not the most destructive; as they fly, they yield to
the current of the wind which hurries them into the sea,
or into sandy deserts where they perish with hunger or
fatigue. The young locusts, that cannot fly, are the
most ruinous; they are about fifteen lines in length;
and the thickness of a goose quill. They creep over the
country in such multitudes that they leave not a blade
of grass behind; and the noise of their feeding announces
their approach at some distance. The devastations of
locusts increase the price of provisions, and often occasion
famines; but the Moors find a kind of compensation in
making food of these insects; prodigious quantities are
brought to market salted and dried like red herrings.
They have an oily and rancid taste, which habit only
can render agreeable; they are eat here, however, with

In 1778 the empire of Morocco was ravaged by these insects.
In the summer of that year, such clouds of locusts
came from the south that they darkened the air, and devoured
a part of the harvest. Their offspring, which
they left on the ground, committed still much greater
mischief. Locusts appeared and bred anew in the following
year, so that in the spring the country was
wholly covered, and they crawled one over the other
in search of their subsistence.
</p>
               <p part="N">
It has been remarked, in speaking of the climate of Morocco,
that the young locusts are those which are the
most mischievous; and that it seems almost impossible
to rid the land of these insects and their ravages, when
the country once becomes thus afflicted. In order to
preserve the houses and gardens in the neighbourhood
of cities, they dig a ditch two feet in depth and as much
in width. This they pallisade with reeds close to each
other, and inclined inward toward the ditch; so that
the insects unable to climb up the slippery reed, fall
back into the ditch, where they devour one another.
</p>
               <p part="N">
This was the means by which the gardens and vineyards
of Rabat, and the city itself were delivered from this
scourge, in 1779. The intrenchment, which was, at
least, a league in extent, formed a semicircle from the
sea to river, which separates Rabat from Sallee. The
quantity of young locusts here assembled was so prodigious
that, on the third day, the ditch could not be approached
because of the stench. The whole country
was eaten up, the very bark of the fig, pomegranate,
and orange tree, bitter, hard, and corrosive as it was
could not escape the voracity of these insects.
</p>

The lands, ravaged throughout all the western provinces,
produced no harvest, and the Moors being obliged to
live on their stores, which the exportation of corn
(permitted till 1774) had drained, began to feel a dearth.
Their cattle, for which they make no provision, and
which in these climates, have no other subsistance than
that of daily grazing, died with hunger; nor could any
be preserved but those which were in the neighbourhood
of mountains, or in marshy grounds, where the regrowth
of pasturage is more rapid.
</p>
               <p part="N">
In 1780, the distress was still farther increased. The
dry winter had checked the products of the earth,
and given birth to a new generation of locusts, who devoured
whatever had escaped from the inclemency of
the season. The husbandman did not reap even what
he had sowed, and found himself destitute of food,
cattle, or seed corn. In this time of extreme wretchedness
the poor felt all the horrors of famine. They
were seen wandering over the country to devour roots,
and, perhaps, abridged their days by digging into the
entrails of the earth in search of the crude means by
which they might be preserved.

wife, would take her into another province, there to bestow
her in marriage as if she were his sister, and
afterwards come and reclaim her when his wants were
no longer so great. I have seen women and children
run after camels, and rake in their dung to seek for some
indigested grain of barley, which, if they found, they devoured
with avidity.

is a bird which better deserves to be described, perhaps,
than most others of which travellers have given us an
account, because the facts relating to it are not only
strange, in themselves, but so well and distinctly attested,
that however surprising they may seem, we cannot
but afford them our belief. The food of this creature
is the locust, or the grasshopper: it is of the size
of an ordinary hen, its feathers black, its wings large,
and its flesh of a greyish colour; they fly generally in
great flocks, as the starlings are wont to do with us:
but the thing which renders these birds wonderful is,
that they are so fond of the water of a certain fountain
in Corasson, or Bactria, that where-ever that water is
carried, they follow; on which account it is carefully
preserved; for where ever the locusts fall, the Armenian
priests, who are provided with this water, bring a quanity
of it, and place in jars, or pour it into little channels
in the fields, the next day whole troops of these birds
arrive and quickly deliver the people from the locusts.

Sir John Chardin has given us, the following passage
from an antient traveller, in relation to this bird. In
Cyprus about the time that the corn was ripe for the
sickle, the earth produced such a quantity of cavalettes,
or locusts, that they obscured sometimes the splendour
of the sun. Wherever these came, they burnt and eat
up all; for this there was no remedy, since, as fast as
they were destroyed, the earth produced more: God,
however, raised them up a means for their deliverance,
which happened thus. In Persia, near the city of
Cuerch there is a fountain of water, which has a wonderful
property of destroying these insects; for a pitcher
full of this being carried in the open air, without passing
through house or vault, and being set on an high
place, certain birds which follow it, and fly and cry
after the men who carry it from the fountain, come to
the place where it is fixed. These birds are red and
black, and fly in great flocks together, like starlings;
the Turks and Persians call them Musulmans. These
birds no sooner came to Cyprus, but they destroyed the
locusts with which the Island was infested; but if the
water be spilt or lost these creatures immediately disappear;
which accident fell out when the Turks took
this Island; for one of them going up into the steeple of
Famagusta, and finding there a pitcher of this water, he,
fancying that it contained gold or silver, or some precious
thing, broke it, and spilt what was therein; since
which the Cypriots have been as much tormented as
ever by the locusts.

On the confines of the Medes and of Armenia, at certain
times a great quantity of Birds are seen who resemble
our blackbirds, and they have a property sufficiently
curious to make me mention it. When the corn in
these parts begins to grow, it is astonishing to see the
number of Locusts with which all the fields are covered.
The Armenians have no other method of delivering
themselves from these insects, than by going in procession
round the fields and sprinkling them with a particular
water which they take care to preserve in their houses.
For this water comes from a great distance, they fetch
it from a Well belonging to one of their Convents near
the frontiers, and they say that the bodies of many Christian
martyrs were formerly thrown into this well. These
processions and the sprinkling continue three or four
days, after which the Birds that I have mentioned come
in great flights, and whether it be that they eat the locusts,
or drive them away, in two or three days the
country is cleared of them.

At Mosul and at Haleb, says Niebuhr, I heard much of
the Locust Bird, without seeing it. They there call it
<hi rend="italic">Samarmar</hi>, or as others pronounce it, <hi rend="italic">Samarmog</hi>. It is
said to be black, larger than a sparrow, and no ways
pleasant to the palate. I am assured that it every day destroys
an incredible number of Locusts; they pretend nevertheless
that the Locusts sometimes defend themselves,
and devour the Bird with its feathers, when they have
overpowered it by numbers. When the children in the
frontier towns of Arabia catch a live Locust, they place
it before them and cry <hi rend="italic">Samarmog</hi>! And because it
stoops down terrified at the noise, or at the motion of
the child, or clings more closely to its place, the children
believe that it fears the name of its enemy, that it hides
itself, and attempts to throw stones. The <hi rend="italic">Samarmog</hi> is
not a native of Mosul or Haleb, but they go to seek it in
Khorasan with much ceremony. When the Locusts
multiply very greatly, the government sends persons
worthy of trust to a spring near the village of <hi rend="italic">Samarûn</hi>,
situated in a plain between four mountains, by <hi rend="italic">Mesched</hi>, or
<hi rend="italic">Musa er ridda</hi>, in that province of Persia. The deputies
with the ceremonies prescribed fill a chest with this
water, and pitch the chest so that the water may neither
evaporate nor be spilt before their return. From the
spring to the Town whence they were sent, the chest
must always be between heaven and earth: they must
neither place it on the ground, nor under any roof, lest
it should lose all its virtue. Mosul being surrounded
with a wall, the water must not pass under the gate way,
but it is received over the wall, and the chest placed upon
the Mosque <hi rend="italic">Nebbi Gurgis</hi>, a building which was formerly
a church, and which in preference to all the other buildings
has had from time immemorial the honour to
possess this chest upon its roof. When this precious
water has been brought from Khorasan with the requisite
precautions, the common Mohammedans, Christians
and Jews of Mosul believe that the <hi rend="italic">Samarmog</hi> follows

had not sent to procure fresh water.

they are green like the rest of the body, except that
there is in each a little white spot. The Locust keeps
them extended like great sails of a ship going before the
wind, it has besides two other wings underneath the
former, and which resemble a light transparent stuff
pretty much like a cobweb, and which it makes use of
in the manner of smack sails that are along a vessel; but
when the Locust reposes herself she does like a vessel
that lies at anchor, for she keeps the second sails furled

They pretend that God is the lock of this science, and
Mohammed the key, that consequently none but Mohammedans
can attain it; that it discovers what passes
in distant countries, that it familiarizes the possessors
with the Genii, who are at the command of the initiated
and who instruct them; that it places the winds and
the seasons at their disposal, that it heals the bile of
serpents, the lame, the maimed, and the blind. They
say that some of their greatest Saints, such as <hi rend="italic">Abdulkadir Cheilani</hi> of Bagdat, and <hi rend="italic">Ibn Alwan</hi> who resided in the
south of Yemen, were so far advanced in this science
by their devotion, that they said their prayers every noon
in the Kaba of Mecca, and were not absent from their
own houses any other part of the day. A merchant of
Mecca, who had learnt it in all its forms from Mohammed
el Dsjanâdsjeni (at present so famous in that city)
pretended that he himself being in danger of perishing at
sea, had fastened a billet to the mast with the usual
ceremonies, and that immediately the tempest ceased.
He showed me at Bombay, but at a distance, a book
which contained all sorts of figures and mathematical
tables, with instructions how to arrange the billets and
the appropriate prayers for every circumstance. But he
would neither suffer me to touch the Book, nor copy
the title.

There are some Mohammedans who shut themselves up
in a dark place without eating and drinking for a long time,
and there with a loud voice repeat certain short prayers
till they faint. When they recover they pretend to have
seen not only a croud of Spirits, but God himself, and
even the Devil. But the true initiated in the Ism-Allah
do not seek these visions. The secret of discovering hidden
treasures, belong also, if I mistake not, to the

Anchieta was going in a canoe to the mouth of the river
Aldea, a delightful spot, surrounded with mango trees,
and usually abounding with birds called goarazes, that
breed there. These birds are about the size of a hen, their
colour a rich purple, inclining to red. They are white
when hatched, and soon become black, but as they
grow larger lose that colour and take this rich and
beautiful purple. Our navigators had reached the
place, but when they should have enjoyed the fine prospect
which delights all who pass it, the sun was excessively
hot, and this eye-pleasure was purchased dearly
when the whole body was in a profuse perspiration, and
the rowers were in a fever. Their distress called upon
Joseph, and the remedy was no new one to him. He
saw three or four of these birds perched upon a mango,
and calling to them in the Brazilian language which the
rowers understood, said, go you, call your companions,
and come to shade these hot servants of the Lord. The
birds stretched out their necks as if in obedience, and
away they went to seek for others, and in a short time
they came flying in the shape of an elegant cloud, and
they shadowed the canoe a good league out to sea till
the fresh sea breeze sprung up. Then they told them
they might go about their business, and they separated
with a clamor of rude but joyful sounds, which were
only understood by the Author of Nature who created
them. This was a greater miracle than that of the cloud
with which God defended his chosen people in the wilderness
from the heat of the sun, inasmuch as it was a
more elegant and fanciful parasol. <hi rend="italic">Acho que foy maior

No creature seems so peculiarly fitted to the climate in
which it exists. We cannot doubt the nature of the one
has been adapted to that of the other by some <hi rend="italic">disposing intelligence</hi>. Designing the Camel to dwell in a country
where he can find little nourishment, Nature has been
sparing of her materials in the whole of his formation,
She has not bestowed upon him the plump fleshiness of
the ox, horse, or elephant; but limiting herself to
what is strictly necessary, she has given him a small
head without ears, at the end of a long neck without
flesh. She has taken from his legs and thighs every
muscle not immediately resquisite for motion; and in
short has bestowed on his withered body only the
vessels and tendons necessary to connect his frame together.
She has furnished him with a strong jaw, that
he may grind the hardest aliments; but lest he should
consume too much, she has contracted his stomach, and
obliged him to chew the cud. She has lined his foot
with a lump of flesh, which, sliding in the mud, and
being no way adapted for climbing, fits him only for a
dry, level, and sandy soil, like that of Arabia. She has
evidently destined him likewise to slavery, by refusing
him every sort of defence against his enemies. Destitute
of the horns of the bull, the hoofs of the horse, the
tooth of the elephant, and the swiftness of the stag, how
can the camel resist or avoid the attacks of the lion, the
tyger, or even the wolf? To preserve the species therefore,
Nature has concealed him in the depths of the
vast deserts, where the want of vegetables can attract no
game, and whence the want of game repels every voracious
animal. Tyranny must have expelled man from
the habitable parts of the earth, before the Camel could
have lost his liberty. Become domestic, he has rendered
habitable the most barren soil the world contains.
He alone supplies all his master's wants. The milk of
the Camel nourishes the family of the Arab, under the
various forms of curds, cheese, and butter; and they
often feed upon his flesh. Slippers and harness are
made of his skin, and tents and clothing of his hair.
Heavy burthens are transported by his means, and
when the earth denies forage to the horse, so valuable
to the Bedouin, the she-camel supplies that deficiency
by her milk, at no other cost, for so many advantages,
than a few stalks of brambles or wormwood, and
pounded date kernels. So great is the importance of
the Camel to the desert, that were it deprived of that
useful animal, it must infallibly lose every inhabitant.

"I pushed on as fast as possible, in hopes of reaching
some watering-place in the course of the night. My
thirst was by this time become insufferable; my mouth
was parched and inflamed; a sudden dimness would
frequently come over my eyes, with other symptoms of
fainting; and my horse being very much fatigued, I
began seriously to apprehend that I should perish of
thirst. To relieve the burning pain in my mouth and
throat, I chewed the leaves of different shrubs, but
found them all bitter and of no service to me.
</p>
               <p part="N">
A little before sunset, having reached the top of a
gentle rising, I climbed a high tree, from the topmost
branches of which I cast a melancholy look over the
barren wilderness, but without discovering the most
distant trace of a human dwelling. The same dismal
uniformity of shrubs and sand every where presents
itself, and the horizon, was as level and uninterrupted as
that of the sea.
</p>
               <p part="N">
Descending from the tree, I found my horse devouring
the stubble and brushwood with great avidity; and as I
was now too faint to attempt walking, and my horse
too much fatigued to carry me, I thought it but an act
of humanity, and perhaps the last I should ever have
it in my power to perform, to take off his bridle and let
him shift for himself: in doing which I was suddenly
affected with sickness and giddiness, and falling upon
the sand, felt as if the hour of death was fast approaching.
Here then, thought I, after a short but ineffectual
struggle, terminate all my hopes of being useful in my
day and generation; here must the short span of my
life come to an end.—I cast (as I believed) a last look
on the surrounding scene, and whilst I reflected on the
awful change that was about to take place, this world
with its enjoyments seemed to vanish from my recollection.
Nature however, at length resumed its functions;
and on recovering my senses, I found myself
stretched upon the sand with the bridle still in my hand,
and the sun just sinking behind the trees. I now summoned
all my resolution, and determined to make
another effort to prolong my existence. And as the
evening was somewhat cool, I resolved to travel as far
as my limbs would carry me, in hopes of reaching (my
only resource) a watering place. With this view I put
the bridle on my horse, and driving him before me,
went slowly along for about an hour, when I perceived
some lightning from the north east, a most delightful
sight, for it promised rain. The darkness and lightning
increased very rapidly; and in less than an hour I heard
the wind roaring among the bushes. I had already
opened my mouth to receive the refreshing drops which
I expected, but I was instantly covered with a cloud of
sand, driven with such force by the wind as to give a
very disagreeable sensation to my face and arms, and I
was obliged to mount my horse and stop under a bush,
to prevent being suffocated. The sand continued to fly
in amazing quantities for near an hour, after which I
again set forward, and travelled with difficulty, until
ten o'clock. About this time I was agreeably surprized
by some very vivid flashes of lightning, followed by a
few heavy drops of rain. In a little time the sand
ceased to fly, and I alighted, and spread out all my
clean clothes to collect the rain, which at length I saw
would certainly fall.—For more than an hour it rained
plentifully, and I quenched my thirst, by wringing and
sucking my clothes.

               <p part="N"> All the time I was in Barbary I could never get
sight of above three or four Dromedaries. These the
Arabs call Mehera, the singular is Meheri. They are
of several sorts, and degrees of value, some worth many
common Camels, others scarce worth two or three.
To look on, they seem little different from the rest of
that Species, only I think the Excrescence on a Dromedary's
Back is somewhat less than that of a Camel.
What is reported of their sleeping, or rather seeming
scarce alive, for some Time after coming into this
World, is no Fable. The longer they lie so, the more
excellent they prove in their Kind, and consequently of
higher Price and Esteem. None lie in that Trance
more than ten Days and Nights. These that do, are
pretty rare, and are called Ashari from Aashara, which
signifies ten in Arabick. I saw one such, perfectly
white all over, belonging to Lella Oumane Princess of
that noble Arab Neja, named Hayl ben Ali, I spoke of,
and upon which she put a very great Value, never
sending it abroad but upon some extraordinary Occasion,
when the greatest Expedition was required; having
others, inferior in swiftness, for more ordinary Messages.
They say that one of these Aasharies will, in one Night,
and thro' a level Country, traverse as much Ground as
any single Horse can perform in ten, which is no Exaggeration
of the Matter, since many have affirmed to
me, that it makes nothing of holding its rapid Pace,
which is a most violent Hard Trot, for four and twenty
Hours upon a Stretch without shewing the least Sign of
Weariness, or Inclination to Bait; and that having then
swallowed a Ball or two of Sort of a Paste, made up of
Barley-Meal, and may be a little Powder of Dates
among it, with a Bowl of Water, or Camel's Milk, if to
be had, and which the Courier seldom forgets to be
provided with, in Skins, as well for the Sustenance of
himself as of his Pegasus, the indefatigable Animal will
seem as fresh as at first setting out, and ready to continue
running at the same scarce credible Rate, for as
many Hours longer, and so on from one Extremity of
the African Desarts to the other; provided its Rider
could hold out without Sleep, and other Refreshment.
This has been averred to me, by, I believe more than
a thousand Arabs and Moors, all agreeing in every
Particular.
</p>
               <p part="N">
I happened to be, once in particular, at the Tent of
that Princess, with Ali ben Mahamoud, the Bey, or
Vice-Roy of the Algerine Eastern Province, when he
went thither to celebrate his Nuptials with Ambarca,
her only Daughter, if I mistake not. Among other
Entertainments she gave her Guests, the favourite
white Dromedary was brought forth, ready Saddled and
Bridled. I say Bridled, because the Thong, which
serves instead of a Bridle, was put thro' the Hole purposely
made in the Gristle of the Creature's Nose. The
Arab appointed to mount, was straightly laced, from
the very Loins quite to his Throat, in a strong Leathern
Jacket; they never riding these Animals any otherwise
accoutred, so impetuously violent are the Concussions
the Rider undergoes, during that rapid Motion, that
were he to be loose. I much question whether a few
Hours such unintermitting Agitation would not endanger
the bursting of some of his Entrails: And this
the Arabs scruple not to acknowledge. We were to be
diverted with seeing this fine Ashari run against some
of the swiftest Barbs in the whole Neja, which is
famed for having good ones, of the true Libyan Breed,
shaped like Greyhounds, and which will sometimes run
down an Ostridge; which few of the very best can pretend
to do, especially upon a hard Ground, perfectly
level. We all started like Racers, and for the first
Spurt, most of the best mounted among us kept up
pretty well, but our Grass fed Horses soon flagged:
Several of the Libyan and Numidian Runners held
Pace till we, who still followed upon a good round
Hand Gallop, could no longer discern them, and then
gave out; as we were told after their Return. When
the Dromedary had been out of our Sight about half an
Hour, we again espied it flying towards us with an amazing
Volocity, and in a very few Moments was among
us, and seemingly nothing concerned; while the Horses
and Mares were all on a Foam, and scarce able to
breathe, as was, likewise, a fleet, tall Greyhound Bitch,
of the young Prince's, who had followed and kept Pace
the whole Time, and was no sooner got back to us,
but lay down panting as if ready to expire. I cannot
tell how many Miles we went; but we were near three
Hours in coming leisurely back to the Tents, yet made
no Stop in the Way. The young Prince Hamet ben al
Guydom ben Sakhari, and his younger Brother Messoud,
told their new Brother-in-Law, that they defied all the
Potentates of Africa to shew him such an Ashari; and
the Arab who rode it, challenged the Bey to lay his
Lady a Wager of 1000 Ducats, that he did not bring
him an Answer to a Letter from the Prince of Wargala,
in less than four Days, tho' Leo Africanus, Marmol, and
several others assure us, that it is no less than forty
Spanish Leagues, of four Miles each, South of Tuggurt
to which Place, upon another Occasion, as I
shall observe, we made six tedious Days March from
the Neighbourhood of Biscara, North of which we
were then, at least thirty Hours riding, if I remember
rightly. However the Bey, who was a Native of Biscara,
and consequently well acquainted with the
Sahara, durst not take him up. By all Circumstances,
and the Description given us, besides what I know of
the Matter my self, it could not be much less than 400
Miles, and as many back again, the fellow offered to ride,
in so short a Time; nay many other Arabs boldly proffered
to venture all they were worth in the World, that
he would perform it with all the Ease imaginable.

surely the most magnificent in the world. In that vast
expanse of desert, from W. and to N. W. of us, we saw
a number of prodigious pillars of sand at different distances,
at times moving with great celerity, at others
stalking with a majestic slowness: at intervals we thought
they were coming in a very few moments to overwhelm us,
and small quantities of sand did actually more than once
reach us. Again they would retreat so as to be almost out
of sight, their tops reaching to the very clouds. There
the tops often separated from the bodies, and these once
disjoined, dispersed in the air and did not appear more.
Sometimes they were broken near the middle, as if
struck with a large cannon shot. About noon they
began to advance with considerable swiftness upon us,
the wind being very strong at north. Eleven of them
ranged alongside of us about the distance of three miles.
The greatest diameter of the largest appeared to me at
that distance as if it would measure ten feet. They
retired from us with a wind at S. E. leaving an impression
upon my mind to which I can give no name;
though surely one ingredient in it was fear, with a
considerable deal of wonder and astonishment. It
was in vain to think of flying, the swiftest horse, or
fastest sailing ship could be of no use to carry us out of
this danger, and the full persuasion of this rivetted me as
if to the spot where I stood.

On the 15th the same appearance of moving pillars of
sand presented themselves to us, only they seemed to be
more in number, and less in size. They came
several times in a direction close upon us; that is, I
believe, within less than two miles. They began immediately
after sun-rise, like a thick wood, and almost
darkened the sun. His rays shining through them for
near an hour, gave them an appearance of pillars of
fire. Our people now became desperate: the Greeks
shrieked out, and said it was the day of judgement.
Ismael pronounced it to be hell, and the Tucorories
that the world was on fire.

banks of the Tigris, where Seleucia formerly stood, was
so delighted with the beauty of the country, that he
resolved there to build his new Capital. Whilst he was
conversing with his attendants upon this project, one of
them separating from the rest met a hermit whose cell
was near, and entered into talk with him and communicated
the design of the Caliph. The Hermit replied,
he well knew by a tradition of the country that
a city would one day be built in that plain, but that its
founder would be a man called Moclas, a name very
different from both those of the Caliph, Giaffar and
Almanzor.

The Officer rejoined Almanzor and repeated his conversation
with the Hermit. As soon as the Caliph heard the
name of Moclas, he descended from his horse, prostrated
himself, and returned thanks to God for that he
was chosen to execute his orders. His courtiers waited
for an explanation of this conduct with eagerness, and
the Caliph told them thus. During the Caliphate of the
Ommiades, my brothers and myself being very young
and possessing very little, were obliged to live in the
country, where each in rotation was to provide sustenance
for the whole. On one of my days as I was without
money, and had no means of procuring food, I took a
bracelet belonging to my nurse and pawned it. This
woman made a great outcry, and after much search
discovered that I had been the thief. In her anger
she abused me plentifully, and among other terms of
reproach, she called me Moclas, the name of a famous
robber in those days; and during the rest of her
life she never called me by any other name. Therefore
I know that God has destined me to perform
this work.

this Hermit who dwelt upon its site.
</p>
               <p part="N">
Bagdat was founded in consequence of a singular superstition.
A sect called Ravendiens conceived that
they ought to render those honours to the Caliphs, which
the Moslem hold should only be paid to the Deity.
They therefore came in great numbers to Haschemia,
where the Caliph Almanzor usually resided, and made
around his palace the same processions and ceremonies
which the Moslem made around the Temple at Mecca.
The Caliph prohibited this, commanding them not to
profane a religious ceremony which ought to be reserved
solely to the Temple at Mecca. The Ravendiens did
not regard the prohibition, and continued to act as
before.
</p>
               <p part="N">
Almanzor seeing their obstinacy resolved to conquer
it, and began by arresting an hundred of these fanatics.
This astonished them, but they soon recovered their
courage, took arms, marched to the prison, forced the
doors, delivered their friends, and then returned to
make their processions round the palace in reverence of
the Caliph.
</p>
               <p part="N">
Enraged at this insolence the Caliph put himself at the
head of his guards, and advanced against the Ravendiens,
expecting that his appearance would immediately disperse
them. Instead of this they resisted, and repulsed
him so vigorously that he had nearly fallen a victim.
But timely succours arrived and after a great slaughter
these fanatics were expelled the town. This singular
rebellion arising from excess of loyalty so disgusted
Almanzor that he determined to forsake the town which
had witnessed it, and accordingly laid the foundation of
Bagdat.

               <p part="N"> At Bagdad are many cranes who build their nests
upon the tops of the minarets, and the loftiest houses.
</p>
               <p part="N">
At Adanaqui—cranes are so abundant, that there is
scarcely a house which has not several nests upon it.
They are very tame, and the inhabitants never molest
them. When any thing disturbs these birds, they make
a violent clatter with their long beaks, which is sometimes
repeated by the others all over the town; and
this noise will sometimes continue for several minutes.
It is as loud as a watchman's rattle, and not much
unlike it in sound.

The cranes were now arrived at their respective quarters,
and a couple had made their nest, which is bigger
in circumference than a bushel, on a dome close by our
chamber. This pair stood, side by side, with great
gravity, shewing no concern at what was transacting
beneath them, but at intervals twisting about their long
necks, and cluttering with their beaks, turned behind
them upon their backs, as it were in concert.
This was continued the whole night. An
Owl, a bird also unmolested, was perched hard by,
and as frequently hooted. The crane is tall, like a
heron, but much larger; the body white, with black
pinions, the neck and legs very long, the head small,
and the bill thick. The Turks call it friend and brother,
believing it has an affection for their nation, and will
accompany them into the countries they shall conquer.
In the course of our journey we saw one hopping on a
wall with a single leg, the maimed stump wrapped in
linen.

               <p part="N"> Our early Travellers have given us strange and circumstantial
accounts of what they conceive to have
been the Temple of Belus.
</p>
               <p part="N">
The Tower of Nimrod or Babel is situate on that side of
Tygris that Arabia is, and in a very great plaine distant
from Babylon seven or eight miles; which tower is
ruinated on every side, and with the falling of it there is
made a great mountaine; so that it hath no forme at
all, yet there is a great part of it standing, which
is compassed and almost covered with the aforesayd
fallings: this Tower was builded and made of foure-square
brickes, which brickes were made of earth, and
dried in the Sunne in maner and forme following:
first they layed a lay of brickes, then a mat made of
canes, square as the brickes, and instead of lime, they
daubed it with earth: these mats of canes are at this
time so strong, that it is a thing woonderfull to beholde,
being of such great antiquity: I have gone round about
it, and have not found any place where there hath bene
any doore or entrance: it may be in my judgement in
circuit about a mile, and rather lesse than more.
</p>
               <p part="N">
This Tower in effect is contrary to all other things which
are seene afar off, for they seeme small and the more
nere a man commeth to them the bigger they be: but this
tower afar off seemeth a very great thing, and the nerer you
come to it the lesser. My judgement and reason of this
is, that because the Tower is set in a very great plaine,
and hath nothing more about to make any shew saving
the ruines of it which it hath made round about, and
for this respect descrying it afarre off, that piece of the
Tower which yet standeth with the mountaine that is
made of the substance that hath fallen from it, maketh
a greater shew than you shall finde comming neere
to it.

In the middle of a vast and level plain, about a quarter
of a league from Euphrates, which in that place runs
westward, appears a heap of ruined buildings, like a huge
mountain, the materials of which are so confounded
together that one knows not what to make of it. Its
figure is square, and rises in form of a tower or pyramid
with four fronts which answer to the four quarters of
the compass; but it seems longer from north to S.
than from E. to W. and is, as far as I could judge by
my pacing it, a large quarter of a league. Its situation
and form correspond with that pyramid which Strabo
calls the tower of Belus; and is in all likelihood the
tower of Nimrod in Babylon or Babel, as that place is
still called. In that author's time it had nothing remaining
of the stairs and other ornaments mentioned
by Herodotus, the greatest part of it having been ruined
by Xerxes; and Alexander who designed to have restored
it to its former lustre, was prevented by death.
There appear no marks of ruins without the compass of
that huge mass, to convince one that so great a city as
Babylon had ever stood there; all one discovers within
50 or 60 paces of it, being only the remains here and
there of some foundations of buildings; and the country
round about it so flat and level, that one can hardly
believe it should be chosen for the situation of so great
and noble a city as Babylon, or that there were ever any
remarkable buildings on it. But for my part I am
astonished there appears so much as there does, considering
it is at least 4000 years since that city was
built; and that Diodorus Siculus tells us, it was reduced
almost to nothing in his time. The height of this
mountain of ruins is not in every part equal, but exceeds
the highest palace in Naples: it is a mishapen
mass, wherein there is no appearance of regularity; in
some places it rises in points, is craggy and inaccessible;
in others it is smoother and is of easier ascent; there are
also tracks of torrents from the top to the bottom caused
by the rains, and both withinside and upon it, one sees
parts, some higher and some lower. It is not to be
discovered whether ever there were any steps to ascend
it, or any doors to enter into it; whence one may easily
judge that the stairs ran winding about on the outside;
and that being the less solid parts, they were soonest
demolished, so that not the least sign of any appears at
present.
</p>
               <p part="N">
Withinside one finds some grottos, but so ruined that
one can make nothing of them, whether they were built
at the same time with that work, or made since by the
peasants for shelter, which last seems to be the most
likely. The Mohammedans believe that these caverns
were appointed by God as places of punishment for
Harut and Marut, two angels, who they suppose were
sent from heaven to judge the armies of men, but did not
execute their commissions as they ought. It is evident
from these ruins, that the tower of Nimrod was built
with great and thick bricks, as I carefully observed,
causing holes to be dug in several places for the purpose;
but they do not appear to have been burnt, but dried in
the sun, which is extreme hot in those parts. In laying
these bricks neither lime nor sand was employed,
but only earth tempered and petrified, and in those parts
which made the floors, there had been mingled with
that earth which served instead of lime, bruised reeds,
or hard straw, such as large mats are made of to
strengthen the work. Afterwards one perceives at
certain distances in divers places, especially where the
strongest buttresses were to be, several other bricks of
the same size, but more solid and burnt in a kiln, and
set in good lime, or bitumen, nevertheless the greatest
number consists of those which are only dried in the
sun.

I make no doubt but this ruin was the ancient Babel, and
the tower of Nimrod; for besides the evidence of its
situation, it is acknowledged to be such by the people
of the country, being vulgarly called Babil by the
Arabs.

issues from a certain lake, sending forth a filthy smoke,

It is free for every one to take: they use it to chaulk or

rosary of beads called Tusbah, or implement of praise.
It consists, if I recollect aright, of ninty nine beads; in
dropping which through the fingers, they repeat the attributes
of God, as "O Creator, O Merciful, O Forgiving,
O Omnipotent, O Omniscient, &amp;c. &amp;c." This act of
devotion is called Taleel, from the repetition of the
letter L, or Laum, which occurs in the word Allah,
(God), always joined to the epithet or attribute, as Ya
Allah Khalick, O God, the Creator; Ya Allah Kerreem,
O God, the Merciful, &amp;c. &amp;c. The devotees may be
seen muttering their beads as they walk the streets, and
in the interval of conversation in company. The
rosaries of persons of fortune and rank have the beads
of diamonds, pearls, rubies and emeralds. Those of
the humble are strung with berries, coral, or glass
beads.

at last as a recompence, permission to kiss his shoulders,
immediately two serpents grew there, who fed upon
his flesh and endeavoured to get at his brain. The
Devil now suggested a remedy, which was to quiet them
by giving them every day the brains of two men, killed
for that purpose: this tyranny lasted long, till a blacksmith
of Ispahan whose children had been nearly all
slain to feed the King's serpents, raised his leathern
apron as the standard of revolt, and deposed Zohak.
Zohak, say the Persians, is still living in the cave of his
punishment, a sulphureous vapour issues from the place,
and if a stone be flung in there comes out a voice and
cries, why dost thou fling stones at me? this cavern is
in the mountain of Demawend, which reaches from
that of Elwend, towards Teheran.

I acknowledge that I never tried the secret of the Hand
of Glory, but I have thrice assisted at the definitive
judgment of certain criminals, who, under the torture,
confessed having used it. Being asked what it was, how
they procured it, and what were its uses and properties?
they answered, first, that the use of the Hand of Glory
was to stupify those to whom it was presented, and to
render them motionless, insomuch that they could not
stir, any more than if they were dead; secondly, that it
was the hand of a hanged man; and thirdly, that it
must be prepared in the manner following.
</p>
               <p part="N">
Take the hand, left or right, of a person hanged and exposed
on the highway; wrap it up in a piece of a shroud
or winding sheet, in which let it be well squeezed, to get
out any small quantity of blood that may have remained
in it; then put it into an earthen vessel with Zimat saltpetre,
salt, and long pepper, the whole well powdered;
leave it fifteen days in that vessel; afterwards take it
out, and expose it to the noontide sun in the dog days,
till it is thoroughly dry, and if the Sun is not sufficient,
put it into an oven heated with fern and vervain. Then
compose a kind of candle with the fat of a hanged man,
virgin wax, and sisame of Lapland. The Hand of
Glory is used as a candlestick to hold this candle, when
lighted. Its properties are, that wheresoever any one
goes with this dreadful instrument, the persons to whom
it is presented will be deprived of all power of motion.
On being asked if there was no remedy or antidote, to
counteract this charm, they said the Hand of Glory
would cease to take effect, and thieves could not make
use of it, if the threshold of the door of the house, and
other places by which they might enter, were anointed
with an unguent composed of the gall of a black cat,
the fat of a white hen, and the blood of a screech
owl, which mixture must necessarily be prepared during
the dog days.

care to adorn. Some of them possess, close to their
houses, gardens, trees, or cultivated grounds, and particularly
some spring or well of water. I was once
travelling in the south in the beginning of October,
when the season happened to be exceedingly hot, and
the wells and rivulets of the country were all dried up.
We had neither water, for ourselves, nor for our horses;
and after having taken much fruitless trouble to obtain
some, we went and paid homage to a Saint, who at
first pretended a variety of scruples before he would
suffer infidels to approach; but on promising to give
him ten or 12 shillings, he became exceedingly humane,
and supplied us with as much water as we wanted;
still however vaunting highly of his charity, and particularly
of his disinterestedness.

paint upon their ships and houses, as an antidote and
counter-charm to an evil eye: For five is with them an
unlucky number and five (fingers perhaps) in your eyes,
is their proverb of cursing and defiance. Those who
are grown up, carry always about with them some paragraph
or other of their Koran, which, like as the Jews
did their phylacteries, they place upon their breast, or
sow under their caps, to prevent fascination and witchcraft,
and to secure themselves from sickness and misfortunes.

them upon the necks of their cattle, horses and

Meskouteen, we are to observe farther of them, that
their water is of so intense a heat, that the rocky ground
it runs over, to the distance sometimes of a hundred
foot, is dissolved, or rather calcined by it. When the
substance of these rocks is soft and uniform, then the
water by making every way equal impressions, leaveth
them in the shape of cones or hemispheres; which
being six foot high and a little more or less of the
same diameter, the Arabs maintain to be so many
tents of their predecessors turned into stone. But when
these rocks, besides their usual soft chalky substance,
contain likewise some layers of harder matter, not so
easy to be dissolved, then, in proportion to the resistance
the water is thereby to meet with, we are entertained
with a confusion of traces and channels, distinguished
by the Arabs into Sheep, Camels, Horses,
nay into Men, Women and Children, whom they
suppose to have undergone the like fate with their
habitations. I observed that the fountains which afforded
this water, had been frequently stopped up: or rather
ceasing to run at one place, broke out immediately in
another, which circumstance seems not only to account
for the number of cones, but for that variety likewise of
traces, that are continued from one or other of these
cones or fountains, quite down to the river Zenati.

This place, in riding over it, giveth back such a hollow
sound, that we were afraid every moment of sinking
thro' it. It is probable therefore that the ground below
us was hollow: and may not the air then, which is
pent up within these caverns, afford, as we may suppose,
in escaping continually thro' these fountains, that
mixture of shrill, murmuring and deep sounds, which,
according to the direction of the winds and the motion
of the external air, issue out along with the water? the
Arabs, to quote their strength of imagination once more,
affirm these sounds to be the music of the <hi rend="italic">Jenoune</hi>,
Fairies, who are supposed, in a particular manner, to
make their abodes at this place, and to be the grand
agents in all these extraordinary appearances.

There are other natural curiosities likewise at this place.
For the chalky stone being dissolved into a fine impalpable
powder and carried down afterwards with the
stream, lodgeth itself upon the sides of the channel, nay
sometimes upon the lips of the fountains themselves;
or else embracing twigs, straws and other bodies in its
way, immediately hardeneth and shoots into a bright
fibrous substance, like the Asbestos, forming itself at
the same time, into a variety of glittering figures and
beautiful christalizations.

the cistern. At the four corners of the cistern are four
large glass bottles, each containing about twenty quarts
of wine, one white, another red. From one to the

holding about four or five quarts, white and red alternately.
Round the cellar are several rows of niches in
the wall, and in each nich is a bottle also of red and
white alternately.—Some niches are made to hold two.
Some windows give light to the apartment, and all
these bottles so well ranged with their various colours
have a very fine effect to the eye. They are always
kept full, the wine preserving better, and therefore are
replenished as fast as they are emptied.

commandeth him that is governor of the sayd paradise,
to bring thereunto some of the acquaintance of the
sayd king or baron, permitting him awhile to take his
pleasure therein, and then to give him a certeine potion
being of force to cast him into such a slumber as should
make him quite voide of all sense, and so being in a profound
sleepe to convey him out of his paradise: who
being awaked, and seeing himselfe thrust out of the
paradise, would become so sorrowfull, that he could not
in the world devise what to do, or whither to turne him.
Then would he go unto the foresaide old man, beseeching
him that he might be admitted againe into his
paradise: who saith unto him, you cannot be admitted
thither, unlesse you will slay such or such a man for
my sake, and if you will give the attempt onely whether
you kill him or no, I wil place you againe in paradise,
that there you may remaine alwayes: then would the
party without faile put the same in execution, indevouring

               <p part="N"> As the celestial Apostle, at his retreat from <hi rend="italic">Medina</hi>,
did not perform always the five canonical prayers at the
precise time, his disciples, who often neglected to join
with him in the <hi rend="italic">Namaz</hi>, assembled one day to fix upon
some method of announcing to the public those moments
of the day and night when their master discharged
this first of religious duties. Flags, bells, trumpets, and
fire were successively proposed as signals. None of
these, however, were admitted. The flags were rejected
as unsuited to the sanctity of the object; the bells, on
account of their being used by Christians; the trumpets,
as appropriated to the Hebrew worship; the fire, as
having too near an analogy to the religion of the pyrolators.
From this contrariety of opinions the disciples
separated without any determination. But one of them,
<hi rend="italic">Abdullah ibn Zeid Abderiyé</hi>, saw the night following, in a
dream, a celestial being clothed in green: he immediately
requested his advice, with the most zealous earnestness,
respecting the object in dispute. I am come to inform
you, replied the heavenly visitor, how to discharge this
important duty of your religion. He then ascended to
the roof of the house, and declared the <hi rend="italic">Ezann</hi> with a
loud voice, and in the same words which have been
ever since used to declare the canonical periods. When
he awoke, <hi rend="italic">Abdullah</hi> ran to declare his vision to the prophet,
who loaded him with blessings, and authorized
that moment <hi rend="italic">Bilal Habeschy</hi>, another of his disciples, to
discharge, on the top of his house, that august office, by
the title of <hi rend="italic">Muzzinn</hi>.
</p>
               <p part="N">
These are the words of the Ezann: <hi rend="italic">Most high God!
most high God! most high God! I acknowledge that there
is no other except God; I acknowledge that there is no other
except God! I acknowledge that</hi> Mohammed <hi rend="italic">is the Prophet
of God! come to prayer! come to prayer! come to the temple
of salvation! Great God! great God! there is no God
except God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p part="N">
This declaration must be the same for each of the five
canonical periods, except that of the morning, when the
<hi rend="italic">Muezzinn</hi> ought to add, after the words, <hi rend="italic">come to the temple of salvation</hi>, the following: <hi rend="italic">prayer is to be preferred to sleep, prayer is to be preferred to sleep</hi>.
</p>
               <p part="N">
This addition was produced by the zeal and piety of
<hi rend="italic">Bilal Habeschy</hi>: as he announced one day the <hi rend="italic">Ezann</hi> of
the dawn in the prophet's antichamber, Aische in a
whisper informed him, that the celestial envoy was still
asleep; this first of the <hi rend="italic">Muezzinns</hi> then added these
words, <hi rend="italic">prayer is to be preferred to sleep</hi>: when he awoke
the prophet applauded him, and commanded <hi rend="italic">Bilal</hi> to
insert them in all the morning <hi rend="italic">Ezanns</hi>.
</p>
               <p part="N">
The words must be chanted, but with deliberation and
gravity, those particularly which constitute the profession
of the faith. The <hi rend="italic">Muezzinn</hi> must pronounce them
distinctly; he must pay more attention to the articulation
of the words than to the melody of his voice; he
must make proper intervals and pauses, and not precipitate
his words, but let them be clearly understood by
the people. He must be interrupted by no other object
whatever. During the whole <hi rend="italic">Ezann</hi> he must stand,
with a finger in each ear, and his face turned, as in
prayer, towards the <hi rend="italic">Keabe</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Mecca</hi>. As he utters these
words, come to prayer, come to the temple of salvation,
he must turn his face to the right and left, because he
is supposed to address all the nations of the world, the
whole expanded universe. At this time the auditors
must recite with a low voice the <hi rend="italic">Tehhlil</hi>. There is no
strength, there is no power, but what is in God, in that
supreme Being, in that powerful Being.

We have had in this country a new scene of Vampirism,
which is duly attested by two officers of the Tribunal of
<hi rend="italic">Belgrade</hi>, who took cognizance of the affair on the spot,
and by an officer in his Imperial Majesty's troops at
<hi rend="italic">Gradisch</hi> (<hi rend="italic">in Sclavonia</hi>) who was an eye-witness of the
proceedings.
</p>
               <p part="N">
In the beginning of <hi rend="italic">September</hi> there died at the village of
<hi rend="italic">Kisilova</hi>, three leagues from <hi rend="italic">Gradisch</hi>, an old man of
above threescore and two: three days after he was
buried he appeared in the night to his son, and desired
he would give him somewhat to eat, and then disappeared.
The next day the son told his neighbours these
particulars. That night the Father did not come, but
the next evening he made him another visit, and desired
something to eat. It is not known whether his son
gave him any thing or not, but the next morning the
young man was found dead in his bed. The Magistrate
or Bailiff of the place had notice of this, as also that the
same day five or six persons fell sick in the village, and
died one after the other. He sent an exact account of
this to the tribunal of <hi rend="italic">Belgrade</hi>, and thereupon two commissioners
were dispatched to the village attended by an
executioner, with instructions to examine closely into
the affair. An officer in the Imperial service, from
whom we have this relation, went also from <hi rend="italic">Gradiseh</hi>, in
order to examine personally an affair of which he had
heard so much. They opened in the first place the
graves of all who had been buried in six weeks. When
they came to that of the old man, they found his eyes
open, his colour fresh, his respiration quick and strong,
yet he appeared to be stiff and insensible. From these
signs they concluded him to be a notorious <hi rend="italic">Vampire</hi>.
The executioner thereupon, by the command of the
commissioners, struck a stake thro' his heart; and when
he had so done, they made a bonfire, and therein consumed
the carcase to ashes. There was no marks of
Vampirism found on his son, or on the bodies of the
other persons who died so suddenly.

Thanks be to God, we are as far as any people can be
from giving into credulity, we acknowledge that all the
lights of physick do not enable us to give any account
of this fact, nor do we pretend to enter into its causes.
However, we cannot avoid giving credit to a matter of
fact juridically attested by competent and unsuspected witnesses,
especially since it is far from being the only one
of the kind. We shall here annex an instance of the
same sort in 1732, already inserted in the Gleaner,
No. 18.
</p>
               <p part="N">
In a certain town of <hi rend="italic">Hungary</hi>, which is called in Latin
<hi rend="italic">Oppida Heidonum</hi>, on the other side <hi rend="italic">Tibiscus</hi>, vulgarly
called the <hi rend="italic">Teysse</hi>; that is to say, the river which washes
the celebrated territory of <hi rend="italic">Tokay</hi> as also a part of
<hi rend="italic">Transilvania</hi>. The people known by the name of <hi rend="italic">Heydukes</hi>
believe that certain dead persons, whom they call Vampires,
suck the blood of the living, insomuch that these
people appear like skeletons, while the dead bodies of
the suckers are so full of blood, that it runs out at all
the passages of their bodies, and even at their very pores.
This odd opinion of theirs they support by a multitude
of facts attested in such a manner, that they leave no
room for doubt. We shall here mention some of the
most considerable.
</p>
               <p part="N">
It is now about five years ago, that a certain <hi rend="italic">Heyduke</hi>, an
inhabitant of the village of <hi rend="italic">Medreiga</hi>, whose name was
Arnold Paul, was bruised to death by a hay-cart, which
ran over him. Thirty days after his death, no less than
four persons died suddenly, in that manner, wherein,
according to the tradition of the country, those people
generally die who are sucked by Vampires. Upon this
a story was called to mind, that this <hi rend="italic">Arnold Paul</hi> had
told in his life-time, viz: that at <hi rend="italic">Cossova</hi> on the Frontiers
of the <hi rend="italic">Turkish Servia</hi>, he had been tormented by a
Vampire; (now the established opinion is that a person
sucked by a Vampire, becomes a Vampire himself, and
sucks in his turn.) But that he had found a way
to rid himself of this evil, by eating some of the earth
out of the Vampire's grave, and rubbing himself with
his blood. This precaution however did not hinder his
becoming a Vampire; insomuch that his body being
taken up forty days after his death, all the marks of a
notorious Vampire were found thereon. His complexion
was fresh, his hair, nails and beard were grown;
he was full of fluid blood, which ran from all parts of
his body upon his shroud. The <hi rend="italic">Hadnagy</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Bailiff</hi> of
the place, who was a person well acquainted with Vampirism,
caused a sharp stake to be thrust, as the custom
is, through the heart of <hi rend="italic">Arnold Paul</hi>, and also quite
through his body; whereupon he cried out dreadfully as
if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head,
burnt his body, and threw the ashes thereof into <hi rend="italic">Saave</hi>.
They took the same measures with the bodies of those
persons who had died of Vampirism, for fear that they
should fall to sucking in their turns.
</p>
               <p part="N">
All these prudent steps did not hinder the same mischief
from breaking out again about five years afterwards,
when several people in the same village died in a very
odd manner. In the space of three months, seventeen
persons of all ages and sexes died of Vampirism, some
suddenly, and some after two or three days suffering.
Amongst others there was one <hi rend="italic">Stanoska</hi>, the daughter of
a <hi rend="italic">Heyduke</hi> whose name was <hi rend="italic">Jovitzo</hi> who going to bed in
perfect health, waked in the middle of the night, and
making a terrible outcry, affirmed that the son of a
certain <hi rend="italic">Heyduke</hi> whose name was <hi rend="italic">Millo</hi>, and who had
been dead about three weeks, had attempted to strangle
her in her sleep. She continued from that time in a
languishing condition, and in the space of three days
died. What this girl had said discovered the son of
<hi rend="italic">Millo</hi> to be a Vampire. They took up the body and
found him so in effect. The principal persons of the
place, particularly the Physician and Surgeons, began
to examine very narrowly, how, in spite of all their
precautions, Vampirism had again broke out in so terrible
a manner. After a strict inquisition, they found that
the deceased <hi rend="italic">Arnold Paul</hi> had not only sucked the four
persons before mentioned, but likewise several beasts, of
whom the new Vampires had eaten, particularly the son
of <hi rend="italic">Millo</hi>. Induced by these circumstances, they took a
resolution, of digging up the bodies of all persons who
had died within a certain time. They did so, and
amongst forty bodies, there were found seventeen evidently
Vampires. Through the hearts of these they
drove stakes, cut off their heads, burnt the bodies, and
threw the ashes into the river. All the informations we
have been speaking of were taken in a legal way, and
all the executions were so performed, as appears by
certificates drawn up in full form, attested by several
officers in the neighbouring garrisons, by the surgeons
of several Regiments, and the principal inhabitants of
the place. The verbal process was sent towards the
latter end of last <hi rend="italic">January</hi> to the council of war at <hi rend="italic">Vienna</hi>,
who thereupon established a special commission to
examine into these facts. Those just now mentioned
were attested by the <hi rend="italic">Hadnagi Barriarer</hi>, the principal
<hi rend="italic">Heyduke</hi> of the village, as also by <hi rend="italic">Battuer</hi>, first Lieutenant of Prince <hi rend="italic">Alexander</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Wirtemberg</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Flickstenger</hi>,
surgeon major of the regiment of <hi rend="italic">Furstemberg</hi>, three
other surgeons of the same regiment, and several other
persons.

A similar superstition prevails in Greece.
The man whose story we are going to relate, was a Peasant
of Mycone, naturally ill natured and quarrelsome,
this is a circumstance to be taken notice of in such
cases. He was murdered in the fields, nobody knew
how, or by whom. Two days after his being buried in
a Chapel in the town, it was noised about that he was
seen to walk in the night with great haste, that he tumbled
about people's goods, put out their lamps, griped
them behind, and a thousand other monkey tricks. At
first the story was received with laughter; but the thing
was looked upon to be serious when the better sort of
people began to complain of it; the Papas themselves
gave credit to the fact, and no doubt had their reasons
for so doing; masses must be said, to be sure: but for
all this, the Peasant drove his old trade and heeded nothing
they could do. After divers meetings of the chief
people of the city, of priests, and monks, it was gravely
concluded, that 'twas necessary in consequence of some
musty ceremonial to wait till nine days after the interment
should be expired.
</p>
               <p part="N">
On the tenth day they said one mass in the chapel
where the body was laid, in order to drive out the
Demon which they imagined was got into it. After
mass they took up the body, and got every thing ready
for pulling out its heart. The butcher of the town, an
old clumsy fellow, first opens the belly instead of the
breast, he groped a long while among the entrails, but
could not find what he looked for; at last somebody told
him he should cut up the Diaphragm. The heart was
then pulled out, to the admiration of all the spectators.
In the mean time the Corpse stunk so abominably that
they were obliged to burn frankincense; but the smoke
mixing with the exhalations from the carcass increased
the stink, and began to muddle the poor people's
pericranies. Their imagination, struck with the spectacle
before them, grew full of visions. It came into
their noddles, that a thick smoke came out of the body;
we durst not say 'twas the smoke of the incense. They
were incessantly bawling out Vroucolacas in the chapel
and place before it; this is the name they give to these
pretended Redivivi. The noise bellowed thro' the streets,
and it seemed to be a name invented on purpose to rend
the roof of the chapel. Several there present averr'd
that the wretches blood was extremely red; the Butcher
swore the body was still warm, whence they concluded
that the Deceas'd was a very ill man for not being
thoroughly dead, or in plain terms for suffering himself to
be re-animated by Old Nick; which is the notion they
have of Vroucolacas. They then roar'd out that
name in a stupendous manner. Just at this time came
in a flock of people loudly protesting they plainly perceived
the Body was not grown stiff when it was carried
from the fields to Church to be buried, and that
consequently it was a true Vroucolacas; which word
was still the burden of the song.
</p>
               <p part="N">
I don't doubt they would have sworn it did not stink,
had not we been there; so mazed were the poor people
with this disaster, and so infatuated with their notion of
the Dead being re-animated. As for us, who were got
as close to the corpse as we could, that we might be
more exact in our observations, we were almost poisoned
with the intolerable stink that issued from it.
When they asked us what we thought of this body, we
told them we believed it to be very thoroughly dead: but
as we were willing to cure, or at least not to exasperate
their prejudiced imaginations, we represented to them,
that it was no wonder the butcher should feel a little
warmth when he groped among Entrails that were
then rotting, that it was no extraordinary thing for it
to emit fumes, since dung turned up will do the same;
that as for the pretended redness of the blood, it still
appeared by the butcher's hands to be nothing but a
very stinking nasty smear.
</p>
               <p part="N">
After all our reasons they were of opinion it would be
their wisest course to burn the dead man's heart on the
sea-shore: but this execution did not make him a bit
more tractable; he went on with his racket more
furiously than ever; he was accused of beating folks in
the night, breaking down doors, and even roofs of
houses, clattering windows, tearing clothes, emptying
bottles and vessels. 'Twas the most thirsty Devil! I
believe he did not spare any body but the Consul in
whose house we lodged. Nothing could be more miserable
than the condition of this island; all the inhabitants
seemed frighted out of their senses: the wisest among
them were stricken like the rest; 'twas an epidemical
disease of the brain, as dangerous and infectious as the
madness of dogs. Whole families quitted their houses,
and brought their tent beds from the farthest parts of
the town into the public place, there to spend the night.
They were every instant complaining of some new
insult; nothing was to be heard but sighs and groans at
the approach of night: the better sort of people retired
into the country.
</p>
               <p part="N">
When the prepossession was so general, we thought it
our best way to hold our tongues. Had we opposed it,
we had not only been accounted ridiculous blockheads,
but Atheists and Infidels, how was it possible to stand
against the madness of a whole people? Those that
believed we doubted the truth of the fact, came and
upbraided us with our incredulity, and strove to prove
that there were such things as Vroucolacasses, by citations
out of the Buckler of Faith, written by F. Richard
a Jesuit Missionary. He was a Latin, say they, and
consequently you ought to give him credit. We should
have got nothing by denying the justness of the consequence:
it was as good as a Comedy to us every morning
to hear the new follies committed by this night bird;
they charged him with being guilty of the most abominable
sins.
</p>
               <p part="N">
Some Citizens, that were most zealous for the good of
the public, fancied they had been deficient in the most
material part of the ceremony. They were of opinion
that they had been wrong in saying mass before they
had pulled out the wretches heart: had we taken this
precaution, quoth they, we had bit the Devil as sure as
a gun; he would have been hanged before he would
ever have come there again: whereas saying mass first,
the cunning Dog fled for it awhile and came back again
when the danger was over.
</p>
               <p part="N">
Notwithstanding these wise reflections, they remained in
as much perplexity as they were the first day: they
meet night and morning, they debate, they make professions
three days and three nights, they oblige the
Papas to fast; you might see them running from house
to house, holy-water-brush in hand sprinkling it all
about, and washing the doors with it; nay they poured
it into the mouth of the poor Vroucolacas.

We so often repeated it to the Magistrates of the town,
that in Xtendom we should keep the strictest watch
a nights upon such an occasion, to observe what was
done; that at last they caught a few vagabonds, who
undoubtedly had a hand in these disorders: but either

One day as they were hard at this work, after having
stuck I know not how many naked swords over the
grave of this corpse, which they took up three or four
times a day, for any man's whim; an Albaneze that
happened to be at Mycone, took upon him to say with
a voice of authority, that it was to the last degree ridiculous
to make use of the swords of Xtians in a case
like this. Can you not conceive, blind as ye are, says
he, that the handles of these swords being made like a
cross, hinders the Devil from coming out of the body?
Why do you not rather take the Turkish sabres? The
advice of this learned man had no effect: the Vroucolacas
was incorrigible, and all the inhabitants were in a
strange consternation; they knew not now what Saint
to call upon, when of a sudden with one voice, as if they
had given each other the hint, they fell to bawling out
all thro' the city, that it was intolerable to wait any
longer; that the only way left was to burn the Vroucolacas
intire; that after so doing, let the Devil lurk in it if
he could; that 'twas better to have recourse to this
extremity than to have the island totally deserted, and
indeed whole families began to pack up, in order to
retire to Syre or Tinos. The magistrates therefore ordered
the Vroucolacas to be carryed to the point of the
island St. George, where they prepared a great pile with
pitch and tar, for fear the wood, as dry as it was, should
not burn fast enough of itself. What they had before
left of this miserable carcass was thrown into this fire
and consumed presently: 'twas on the first of January,
1701. We saw the flame as we returned from Delos;
it might justly be called a bonfire of joy, since after
this no more complaints were heard against the Vroucolacas;
they said that the Devil had now met with his
match, and some ballads were made to turn him into
ridicule.

The Shaheen or Falcon Gentle, flies at a more dangerous
game. Were there not, says the elder Russell,
several gentlemen now in England to bear witness to
the truth of what I am going to relate, I should hardly
venture to assert that with this bird, which is about the
size of a pigeon, they sometimes take large Eagles.
The Hawk in former times was taught to seize the Eagle
under his pinion, and thus depriving him of the use of
one wing, both birds fell to the ground together: but I am
informed the present mode is to teach the Hawk to fix on
the back between the wings, which has the same effect,
only that the bird tumbling down more slowly, the
Falconer has more time to come in to his Hawk's
assistance; but in either case, if he be not very
expeditious, the Falcon is inevitably destroyed.
</p>
               <p part="N">
Dr. Patrick Russell says, this sport was disused in his
time, probably from its ending more frequently in the
death of the Falcon than of the Eagle. But he had
often seen the Shaheen take Herons and Storks. "The
hawk when thrown off flies for some time in a horizontal
line not six feet from the ground, then mounting perpendicularly
with astonishing swiftness, he seizes his
prey under the wing, and both together come tumbling
to the ground. If the Falconer is not expeditious the
game soon disengages itself.

The Persians train their hawks thus. They take the
whole skin of a stag, of the head, body, and legs, and stuff
it with straw to the shape of the animal. After fixing
it in the place where they usually train the bird, they
place his food upon the head of the stuffed stag, and
chiefly in the two cavities of the eyes, that the Bird may
strike there. Having accustomed him for several days
to eat in this manner, they fasten the feet of the stag to
a plank which runs upon wheels, which is drawn by
cords from a distance; and from day to day they
draw it faster, insensibly to accustom the Bird not to
quit his prey; and at last they draw the stag by a horse
at full speed. They do the same with the wild boar,
the ass, the fox, the hare, and other beasts of chase.—They
are even taught to stop a horseman at full speed,
nor will they quit him till the Falconer recalls them
and shows them their food.

The Kings of Persia are very fond of the chase, and it is

It happened one day that Cha-Sefi wished to entertain
all the Ambassadors who were at his court, and there
were then ministers there from Tartary, Muscovy and
India. He led them to the chase, and having taken in
their presence a great number of large animals, stags, does,
hinds and wild boars, he had them all dressed and eat
the same day, and while they were eating an Architect
was ordered to erect a tower in the middle of Ispahan,
only with the heads of these animals: the remains of
it are yet to be seen. When the Tower was raised
to its proper height, the Architect came exultingly to
the King who was then at the banquet with the
Ambassadors, and informed him that nothing was wanting to
finish the work well, but the head of some large beast
for the point. The Prince in his drunkenness, and with

was over his subjects, turned sternly to the Architect—<hi rend="italic">You are right</hi>, said he, <hi rend="italic">and I do not know where to find a better head than your own</hi>.  The unhappy man was

the whole empire. Several provinces produce it, but
that of Huquam exceeds all the others, as well in quantity
as whiteness. It is gathered in the province of Xantung
upon little trees; but in that of Huquam upon
large ones, as big as those of the Indian Pagods, or
chesnut-trees in Europe. The way nature has found to
produce it, to us appears strange enough. There is in this
province a creature, or insect of the bigness of a flea, so
sharp at stinging, that it not only pierces the skins of
men and beasts, but the boughs and bodies of the trees.
Those of the province of Xantung are much valued;
where the inhabitants gather their eggs from the trees,
and carry them to sell in the province of Huquam. In
the spring, there come from these eggs certain worms,
which about the beginning of the summer they place at
the foot of the tree, whence they creep up, spreading
themselves wonderfully over all the branches. Having
placed themselves there, they gnaw, pierce, and bore to
the very pith, and their nourishment they convert into
wax as white as snow, which they drive out to the
mouth of the hole they have made, where it remains
congealed in drops by the wind, and cold. Then the
owners of the trees gather it, and make it into cakes as
we do, which are sold about China.

               <p part="N"> A Physician of Ragusa was deputed by that little
Republic to negotiate with the Emperor of the Turks.
Before he embarked on this voyage he took into his
service a boy of a red complection, the only son of a
widow, a poor woman, but a woman of honour and
virtuous. This Envoy on his arrival at Constantinople
immediately addressed himself to the first Physician of
his imperial highness, that thro' his favour he might
have more access to negociate for his country. The
Mahometan had no sooner set eyes on the young
Ragusan, than he employed every artifice to induce his
master to leave him. The boy himself, at last, wishing
to remain at Constantinople, flattered by the fair prospects
that were held out to him, and touched with a
tender and heroic compassion for her who had given
him birth, prayed his protector to leave him with the
Barbarian, and carry to his mother the money which on
that account he would receive: So that the Ragusan
physician left his servant to the Byzantian, and received
from him a purse of a thousand sequins. After some
days the Italian went to take leave of the Mohammedan
Physician, and to thank him for his favours; and he
requested earnestly to see the red-headed boy before his
departure. The Turk was obliged to own he had made
poison of him, and led him into a chamber where the
naked body of the boy was still suspended by the feet.
The first master of the red-headed boy was greatly surprized
at the sight and still more so when he heard that
the boy had been beaten upon the belly for six hours,
by slaves who relieved one another, till he died:
and that a poison was made of the last foam that came
from his mouth, so penetrating, that if the stirrup of a
horse were touched with the point of a pin that had
been dipt in it, he who should mount would immediately
die.

In the Islands of Barlovento and in all the country of
Brazil, in Santa Marta and in the new kingdom, and in
other countries, where a cruel sort of Indians inhabited,
they used another sort of poison; for they would take
the leg of an Indian whom they had killed, and hang it
up in the air against the sun, and fill it with many barbs
of poisoned arrows, which were taken out of the flesh
of an Indian, which after some days they took out, and
without cleansing of them, they dried them in the air
where the sun did not come, and then they headed
their arrows with them; and that became the most
malevolent poison, and the most hard to be cured in the
world. After the Spaniards came into that country and
waged war upon the Indians, they then made it with
the flesh of Spaniards, whom they killed or took; but
more particularly they desired the flesh of some red-headed
Spaniard, whose hairs were of a deep saffron
colour; for they were of opinion that there was more
heat in that flesh, and consequently more virulency in
the poison which it produced: but perhaps they may
have heard it often said amongst the Spaniards themselves,
that red-headed men are fit to make a composition
of poison.

The Cameleon, or Indian Salamander, otherwise called
Gekko.
</p>
               <p part="N">
This creature, which is not only found in Brasil, but
also in the Isle of Java, belonging to the East Indies, and
which by our people is called Gekko, from its constant
cry, (like among us that of the Cuckoe) is properly an
Indian Salamander. It is about a foot long, its skin of
of a pale or sea green colour, with red spots. The head
is not unlike that of a tortoise, with a streight mouth.
The eyes are very large, starting out of the head, with
long and small eye-apples. The tail is distinguished by
several white rings; its teeth are so sharp as to make
an impression even upon steel. Each of its four legs
had five crooked claws aimed on the end with nails.
Its gait is very slow, but wherever it fastens it is not
easily removed. It dwells commonly upon rotten trees,
or among the ruines of old houses and churches; it oftentimes
settles near the bedsteads, which makes sometimes
the moors pull down their huts.
</p>
               <p part="N">
Its constant cry is <hi rend="italic">gekko</hi>, but before it begins it makes a
kind of hissing noise. The sting of this creature is so
venomous, that the wound proves mortal, unless it be
immediately burnt with a red hot iron, or cut off. The
blood is of a palish colour, resembling poison itself.
</p>
               <p part="N">
The Javanese use to dip their arrows in the blood of this
creature; and those who deal in poisons among them,
(an art much esteemed in the island of Java, by both
sexes) hang it up with a string tied to the tail on the
cieling, by which means it being exasperated to the
highest pitch sends forth a yellow liquor out of its
mouth, which they gather in small pots set underneath,
and afterwards coagulate into a body in the sun. This
they continue for several months together, by giving
daily food to the creature. It is unquestionably the
strongest poison in the world; its urine being of so corrosive
a quality, that it not only raises blisters, wherever
it touches the skin, but turns the flesh black, and causes
a gangrene.

This custom of crowding about a funeral contributes to

were accustomed to kneel with their heads upon the

"About ten in the morning I saw the grave-digger at
work; the slaves and the women of the family were
seated in the burial ground, many other women arrived,
and then they all began to lament. After this prelude
they one after the other embraced one of the little pillars
which are placed upon the graves, crying out <hi rend="italic">Ogloum, ogloum, sœna Mussaphir gueldi</hi>, My Son, my Son, a
guest is coming to see thee. At these words their tears
and sobs began anew; but the storm did not continue
long; they all seated themselves, and entered into conversation.
</p>
               <p part="N">
At noon I heard a confused noise, and cries of lamentation,
it was the funeral which arrived. A Turk preceded
it, bearing upon his head a small chest; four other
Turks carried the bier upon their shoulders, then came
the father, the relations and the friends of the dead in
great numbers. Their cries ceased at the entrance of the
burial ground, but then they quarrelled—and for
this. The man who bore the chest opened it, it was
filled with copies of the Koran, a croud of Turks,
young and old, threw themselves upon the books and
scrambled for them. Those who succeeded ranged
themselves around the Iman, and all at once began to
recite the Koran, almost as Boys say their lesson. Each
of the readers received ten parats, about fifteen sols,
wrapt in paper. It was then for these fifteen pence
that these pious assistants had quarrelled, and in our
own country you might have seen them fight for
less.
</p>
               <p part="N">
The bier was placed by the grave, in which the grave-digger
was still working, and perfumes were burnt by it.
After the reading of the Koran the Iman chanted some
Arabic prayers, and his full-chant would, no doubt,
have appeared to you, as it did to me, very ridiculous.
All the Turks were standing; they held their hands
open over the grave, and answered <hi rend="italic">Amen</hi> to all the
prayers which the Iman addressed to God for the
deceased.
</p>
               <p part="N">

The cemeteries of the Turks are usually planted with

The chest which was in loose pieces, having been placed
in the grave, the coffin was laid in it, and above planks,
with other pieces of wood. Then all the Turks, taking
spades, cast earth upon the grave to cover it. This is
a part of the ceremony at which all the bystanders
assisted in their turn.
</p>
               <p part="N">
Before the corpse is buried it is carried to the Mosque.
Then after having recited the <hi rend="italic">Fatka</hi> (a prayer very
similar to our Lord's prayer, which is repeated by all
present) the Iman asks the congregation what they have
to testify concerning the life and morals of the deceased.
Each then in his turn relates those good actions with
which he was acquainted. The body is then washed,
and wrapped up like a mummy, so that it cannot be
seen. Drugs and spices are placed in the bier with it,
and it is carried to interment. Before it is lowered
into the grave, the Iman commands silence, saying,
"Cease your lamentations for a moment, and let me
instruct this Moslem how to act, when he arrives in
the other world." Then in the ear of the corpse, he
directs him how to answer the Evil Spirit who will not
fail to question him respecting his religion, &amp;c. This
lesson finished, he repeats the <hi rend="italic">Fatka</hi> with all the assistants,
and the body is let down into the grave. After
they have thrown earth three times upon the grave, as
the Romans used, they retire. The Iman only remains,
he approaches the grave, stoops down, inclines his ear,
and listens to hear if the Dead disputes when the
Angel of Death comes to take him: then he bids him
farewell, and in order to be well paid, never fails to
report to the family the best news of the dead.</p>

by De la Roque. <hi rend="italic">Voyage de Syrie &amp; du Mont Liban.</hi>
1722.
</p>
               <p part="N">
"This little forest is composed of twenty Cedars of a
prodigious size, so large indeed that the finest Planes,
Sycamores, and other large trees which we had seen
could not be compared with them. Besides these
principal Cedars, there were a great number of lesser
ones, and some very small, mingled with the large
trees, or in little clumps near them. They differed not
in their foliage, which resembles the Juniper, and is
green throughout the year: but the great Cedars spread at
their summit and form a perfect round, whereas the
small ones rise in a pyramidal form like the Cypress.
Both diffuse the same pleasant odour; the large ones
only yield fruit, a large cone in shape almost like that
of the Pine, but of a browner colour, and compacter
shell. It gives a very pleasant odour, and contains a
sort of thick and transparent balm, which oozes out
thro' small apertures, and falls drop by drop. This
fruit which it is difficult to separate from the stalk, contains
a nut like that of the Cypress; it grows at the
end of the boughs, and turns its point upwards.
</p>
               <p part="N">
The nature of this tree is not to elevate its trunk, or the
part between the root and the first branches; for the
largest Cedars which we saw did not in the height of
their trunks exceed six or seven feet. From this low
but enormously thick body, prodigious branches rise,
spreading as they rise, and forming by the disposition
of their boughs and leaves which point upward, a sort
of wheel which appears to be the work of art. The
bark of the cedar, except at the trunk, is smooth and
shining, of a brown colour. Its wood white and soft
immediately under the bark, but hard and red within,
and very bitter, which renders it incorruptible and
almost immortal. A fragrant gum issues from the
tree.
</p>
               <p part="N">
The largest Cedar which we measured was seven feet
in circumference, wanting two inches, and the whole
extent of its branches, which it was easy to measure
from their perfect roundness, formed a circumference of
about 120 feet.
</p>
               <p part="N">
The Patriarch of the Maronites, fully persuaded of the
rarity of these Trees, and wishing by the preservation of
those that remain to shew his respect for a forest so
celebrated in Scripture has pronounced canonical pains,
and even excommunication against any Christians who
shall dare to cut them; scarcely will he permit a little
to be sometimes taken for Crucifixes and little tabernacles
in the chapels of our Missionaries.
</p>
               <p part="N">
The Maronites themselves have such a veneration for
these Cedars, that on the day of Transfiguration they
celebrate the festival under them with great solemnity,
the Patriarch officiates and says Mass pontifically, and
among other exercises of devotion they particularly
honour the Virgin Mary there, and sing her praises,
because she is compared to the Cedars of Lebanon, and
Lebanon itself used as a metaphor for the mother of
Christ.
</p>

               <p part="N">
The Maronites say that the snows have no sooner begun
to fall than these Cedars, whose boughs in their infinite
number are all so equal in height that they appear
to have been shorn, and form, as we have said, a sort
of wheel or parasol,—than these Cedars, I say, never
fail at that time to change their figure. The branches
which before spread themselves rise insensibly, gathering
together it may be said, and turn their points upward
towards Heaven, forming altogether a pyramid. It is
Nature, they say, who inspires this movement, and
makes them assume a new shape, without which these
Trees never could sustain the immense weight of snow,
remaining for so long a time.
</p>
               <p part="N">
I have procured more particular information of this fact,
and it has been confirmed by the testimony of many
persons, who have often witnessed it. This is what the
Secretary of the Maronite Patriarch wrote to me in one
of his letters, which I think it right to give in his own
words. <hi rend="italic">Cedri Libani quas plantavit Deus, ut Psalmist:
loquitur, sitae sunt in planitie quâdam, aliquantulum infra
altissimum Montis-Libani cacumen, ubi tempore hyemali
maxima nivium quantitas descendit, tribusque &amp; ultra,
mensibus mordaciter dominatur. Cedri in altum ascendunt
extensis tamen ramis in gyrum solo parallelis, confioientibus
suo gyro fere umbellam solarem. Sed superveniente nive,
quia coacervaretur in magnâ quantitate eos desuper, neque
possent pati tantum pondus tanto tempore premens, sine
certo fractionis discrimine, Natura, rerum omnium provida
mater, ipsis concessit, ut adveniente hyeme &amp; descendente
nive, statim rami in altum assurgant, &amp; secum invicem
uniti constituant quasi conum, ut melius sese ab adveniente
hoste tueantur. Naturá enim ipsâ verum est, virtutem
quamlebet unitam simul reddi fortiorem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p part="N">
The Cedars of Lebanon, which, as the Psalmist says,
God himself planted, are situated in a little plain,
somewhat below the loftiest summit of mount Lebanon,
where in the winter a great quantity of snow falls, and
continues for three months, or longer. The Cedars are
high, but their boughs spread out parallel with the
ground into a circle, forming almost a shield against the
sun. But when the snow falls, which would be heaped
upon them in so great a quantity, that they could not
endure such a weight so long a time, without the certain
danger of breaking, Nature, the provident mother of
all, has endued them with power, that when the winter
comes and the snow descends, their boughs immediately
rise, and uniting together form a cone, that they may be
the better defended from the coming Enemy. For in
Nature itself it is true, that virtue as it is united, becomes
stronger.</p>

Olearius's description of Coffee is amusing. "They

addicted to this pretended science. There is a curious instance
of public folly in Sir John Chardin's travels.

"Sephie-Mirza was born in the year of the <hi rend="italic">Egire</hi> 1057.
for the superstition of the Persians will not let us know
the month or the day. Their addiction to Astrology is
such that they carefully conceal the moments of their
Princes birth, to prevent the casting their nativities,
where they might meet perhaps with something which
they should be unwilling to know."
</p>
               <p part="N">
At the coronation of this Prince two Astrologers were
to be present, with an Astrolabe in their hands, to take
the fortunate hour, as they term it, and observe the
lucky moments that a happy constellation should point
out for proceedings of that importance.
</p>
               <p part="N">
Sephie-Mirza having by debauchery materially injured
his health, the Chief Physician was greatly alarmed,
"in regard his life depended upon the King's, or if his
life were spared yet he was sure to lose his estate and
his liberty, as happens to all those who attend the
Asiatic Sovereigns, when they die under their care.
The Queen Mother too accused him of treason or
ignorance, believing that since he was her Son's
Physician he was obliged to cure him. This made the
Physician at his wits end, so that all his receipts failing
him, he bethought himself of one that was peculiarly
his own invention, and which few physicians would ever
have found out, as not being to be met with neither in
Galen nor Hippocrates. What does he then do, but out
of an extraordinary fetch of his wit, he begins to lay the
fault upon the stars and the King's Astrologers, crying
out that they were altogether in the wrong, that if the
King lay in a languishing condition and could not
recover his health it was because they had failed to
observe the happy hour, or the Aspect of a fortunate
constellation at the time of his coronation." The stratagem
succeeded, the King was recrowned and by the
new name of Solyman!

               <p part="N"> We have now to refute their errour who are persuaded
that Brazen Heads made under certain constellations may
give answers, and be as it were guides and
counsellors, upon all occasions, to those that had them
in their possession. Among these is one Yepes who
affirms that Henry de Villeine made such a one at
Madrid, broken to pieces afterwards by order of John 2.
King of Castile. The same thing is affirmed by Bartholomew
Sibillus, and the Author of the <hi rend="italic">Image of the World</hi>, of Virgil; by William of Malmsbury of Sylvester;
by John Gower of Robert of Lincoln; by the
common people of England of Roger Bacon; and by
Tostatus Bishop of Avilla, George of Venice, Delrio,
Sibillus, Raguseus, Delancre and others, too many to
mention, of Albertus Magnus; who as the most expert,
had made an entire man of the same metal, and had
spent thirty years without any interruption in forming
him under several aspects and constellations. For example,
he formed the eyes, according to the said Tostatus
in his commentaries upon Exodus, when the Sun was in a
sign of the Zodiac correspondent to that part, casting
them out of divers metals mixt together and mark'd
with the characters of the same signs and planets, and
their several and necessary aspects. The same method
he observed in the head, neck, shoulders, thighs, and
legs, all which were fashioned at several times, and
being put and fastened together in the form of a man,
had the faculty to reveal to the said Albertus the
solutions of all his principal difficulties. To which they
add (that nothing be lost of the story of the statue)
that it was battered to pieces by St. Thomas, meerely
because he could not endure its excesse of prating.
</p>
               <p part="N">
But to give a more rational account of this Androides
of Albertus, as also of all these miraculous heads, I
conceive the original of this fable may well be deduced
from the Teraph of the Hebrews, by which as Mr. Selden
affirms, many are of opinion, that we must understand
what is said in Genesis concerning Laban's Gods, and in
the first book of Kings concerning the image which
Michol put into the bed in David's place. For R. Eleazar
holds that it was made of the head of a male child,
the first born and that dead-born, under whose tongue
they applyed a lamen of Gold, whereon were engraved
the characters and inscriptions of certain planets, which
the Jews superstitiously wandered up and down with,
instead of the Urim and Thummim, or the Ephod of
the High Priest. And that this original is true and
well deduced, there is a manifest indicium, in that
Henry D'Assia, and Bartholomæus Sibillus affirm, that
the Androides of Albertus, and the Head made
by Virgil, were composed of flesh and bone, yet
not by nature, but by art. But this being judged impossible
by modern Authors, and the vertue of Images,
Annulets, and planetary Sigills being in great reputation,
men have thought ever since (taking their opinion from
Trismegistus affirming in his Asclepion, that of the
Gods, some were made by the Sovereign God, and
others by men, who, by some art, had the power to
unite the invisible Spirits to things visible and corporeal,
as is explained at large by St. Augustine) that such
figures were made of copper or some other metal,
whereon men had wrought under some favourable
Aspects of Heaven and the planets.

My design is not absolutely to deny that he might compose
some head or statue of man, like that of Memnon,
from which proceeded a small sound and pleasant
noise, when the rising Sun came by his heat to rarify
and force out, by certain small conduits, the air which
in the cold of the night was condensed within it. Or
haply they might be like those statues of Boetius,
whereof Cassiodorus speaking said, <hi rend="italic">Metalla mugiunt</hi>,

In the Vision of Thurcillus the ceremony is accurately

the Devil and his Angels. At the feet of the Devil a
burning pit flamed up, which was the mouth of the
Pit of Hell. A Balance equally poised, was fixed upon
the wall between the Devil and the Apostle, one scale
hanging before each. The Apostle had two weights,
a greater and a less, all shining and like gold, and the
Devil also had two smoky and black ones. Therefore
the Souls that were all black came one after another,
with great fear and trembling, to behold the weighing
of their good and evil works: for these weights weighed
the works of all the souls, according to the good or evil
which they had done. When the scale inclined to the
Apostle, he took the Soul, and introduced it thro' the
Eastern gate, into the fire of Purgatory, that there it
might expiate its crimes. But when the scale inclined
and sunk towards the Devil, then he and his Angels
snatched the soul miserably howling and cursing the
father and mother that begot it to eternal torments, and
cast it with laughter and grinning into the deep and
fiery pit which was at the feet of the Devil. Of this
Balance of good and evil much may be found in the
writings of the holy Fathers."

Lord had died, and that they were returning in anger
because they had not been able to carry away his soul.
I asked him who the great Lord was, and why they had
not been able to carry away his soul. He replied that it
was Charlemagne, and that Saint Jago had been greatly
against them. And I asked him how St. Jago had been
against them; and he replied, we were weighing the
good and the evil which he had done in this world,
and Saint Jago brought so much timber and so many
stones from the churches which he had founded in his
name, that they greatly over-balanced all his evil
works; and so we had no power over his soul. And

The Grave of Francisco Jorge, the Maronite Martyr,
was visited by two strange Birds of unusual size. No one
knew whence they came. They emblemed, says
Vasconcellos, the purity and the indefatigable activity of
his soul.

The inhabitants of Otaheite have assigned a less respectable

The disembowelling of the body there, is always performed
in great secrecy, and with much religious superstition.
The bowels are, by these people, considered as the
immediate organs of sensation, where the first impressions
are received, and by which all the operations of the
mind are carried on: it is therefore natural to conclude,
that they may esteem, and venerate the intestines, as
bearing the greatest affinity to the immortal part. I
have frequently held conversations on this subject, with
a view to convince them, that all intellectual operations
were carried on in the head; at which they would
generally smile, and intimate, that they had frequently
seen men recover whose skulls had been fractured, and
whose heads had otherways been much injured; but
that, in all cases in which the intestines had been
wounded, the persons on a certainty died. Other arguments
they would also advance in favour of their
belief; such as the effect of fear, and other passions,
which caused great agitation and uneasiness, and would
sometimes produce sickness at the stomach, which they
attributed intirely to the action of the bowels.

               <p part="N"> When Hosein the son of Ali was sick of a grievous
disorder, he longed for a pomegranate, tho' that fruit
was not then in season. Ali went out, and diligently
enquiring found a single one in the possession of a Jew.
As he returned with it, a sick man met him and begged
half the pomegranate, saying it would restore his health.
Ali gave him half, and when he had eaten it, the man
requested he would give him the other half, the sooner
to complete his recovery. Ali benignantly complied,
returned to his son and told him what had happened,
and Hosein approved what his father had done.

Immediately behold a miracle! as they were talking
together the door was gently knocked at. He ordered
the woman servant to go there, and she found a man,
of all men the most beautiful, who had a plate in his
hand covered with green silk, in which were ten pomegranates.
The woman was astonished at the beauty of
the man and of the pomegranates, and she took one of
them and hid it, and carried the other nine to Aly, who
kissed the present. When he had counted them he
found that one was wanting, and said so to the servant,
she confessed that she had taken it on account of its
excellence, and Ali gave her her liberty. The Pomegranates
were from Paradise, Hosein was cured of
his disease only by their odour, and rose up immediately,
recovered, and in full strength.

I suspect, says Maracci, that this is a true miracle
wrought by some Christian Saint, and falsely attributed
to Ali. However this may be, it does not appear
absurd that God should by some especial favour reward
an act of remarkable charity even in an Infidel, as
he has sometimes by a striking chastisement punished
enormous crimes. But the assertion that the Pomegranates
were sent from Paradise, exposes the fable.
</p>
               <p part="N">
Maracci after detailing and ridiculing the Mohammedan
miracles, contrasts with them in an appendix a few of
the real and permanent miracles of Christianity which
are proved by the testimony of the whole world. He
selects five as examples. 1. The Chapel of Loretto,
brought by angels from Nazareth to Illyricum, and from
Illyricum to Italy; faithful messengers having been
sent to both places, and finding in both its old foundations,
in dimensions and materials, exactly corresponding.
</p>
               <p part="N">
2. The cross of St. Thomas in Urbe Malipuritana
(Masulipatan) in the E. Indies. A Bramin, as the Saint
was extended upon his cross in prayer, slew him. On
the anniversary of his martyrdom, during the celebration
of Mass, the cross gradually becomes luminous,
till it shines one white glory. At elevating the host it
resumes its natural colour, and sweats blood profusely,
in which the faithful dip their clothes, by which many
miracles are wrought.

3. <hi rend="italic">Certissimum quia evidentissimum</hi>—at <hi rend="italic">Barii</hi> (Bari on
the Adriatic) in Apulia a liquor flows from the bones of
St. Nicholas, they call it St. Nicholas's manna, which
being preserved in bottles never corrupts or breeds
worms—except the possessor be corrupt himself—and
daily it works miracles.
</p>
               <p part="N">
4. At Tolentinum (Tolentino in the Marche of Anconia)
the arms of St. Nicholas swell with blood, and pour
out copious streams—when any great calamity impends
over Christendom.

5. The blood of St. Jaunarius at Naples.

These, says Maracci, are <hi rend="italic">miracula perseverantia</hi>, permanent
miracles—and it cannot be said as of the
Mohammedan ones, that they are tricks of the Devil.</p>

               <p part="N"> Araf is a place between the Paradise and the Hell
of the Mohammedans, some deem it a veil of separation,
some a strong wall; others hold it to be a
Purgatory in which those believers will remain, whose
good and evil works have been so equal that they were
neither virtuous enough to enter Paradise, nor guilty
enough to be condemned to the fire of Hell. From
thence they see the glory of the Blessed, and are near
enough to congratulate them; but their ardent desire to
partake the same happiness becomes a great pain.
At length at the Day of Judgement, when all men
before they are judged, shall be cited to render homage
to their Creator, those who are here confined shall
prostrate themselves before the face of the Lord,
in adoration: and by this act of religion which shall
be accounted a merit, the number of their good
works will exceed their evil ones, and they will enter
into glory.

Saadi says that Araf appears a hell to the happy, and
a Paradise to the damned.
