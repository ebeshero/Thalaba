  <div type="preface"><head>PREFACE</head>


<p>In the continuation of the Arabian Tales,
the Domdaniel is mentioned; a Seminary
for evil Magicians under the Roots of the
Sea. From this seed the present Romance
has grown. Let me not be supposed to
prefer the metre in which it is written, abstractedly
considered, to the regular blank
verse; the noblest measure, in my judgement,
of which our admirable language
is capable. For the following Poem I
have preferred it, because it suits the varied
subject; it is the <hi rend="italic">Arabesque</hi> ornament of an
Arabian tale.</p>

<p>The dramatic sketches of Dr. Sayer, a
volume which no lover of poetry will recollect
without pleasure, induced me when a
young versifier, to practise in this metre.
I felt that while it gave the poet a wider
range of expression, it satisfied the ear of
the reader. It were easy to make a parade
of learning by enumerating the various
feet which it admits; it is only needful to
observe that no two lines are employed in
<hi rend="italic">sequence</hi> which can be read into one. Two
six-syllable lines (it will perhaps be answered)
compose an Alexandrine: the
truth is that the Alexandrine, when harmonious,
is composed of two six-syllable
lines.</p>

<p>One advantage this metre assuredly possesses;
the dullest reader cannot distort
it into discord: he may read it with a
<hi rend="italic">prose mouth</hi>, but its flow and fall will still
be perceptible. Verse is not enough favoured
by the English reader: perhaps
this is owing to the obtrusiveness, the regular
Jews-harp <hi rend="italic">twing-twang</hi>, of what has
been foolishly called heroic measure. I
do not wish the <hi rend="italic">improvisatorè</hi> tune, but
something that denotes the sense of harmony,
something like the accent of feeling;
like the tone which every Poet necessarily
gives to Poetry.</p>

<lg>
<l rend="i4">How beautiful is night!</l>
<l rend="i0">A dewy freshness fills the silent air,</l>
<l rend="i2">No mist obscures, no little cloud</l>
<l rend="i2">Breaks the whole serene of heaven:</l>
<l rend="i0">In full-orbed glory the majestic moon</l>
<l rend="i4">Rolls thro the dark blue depths.</l>
<l rend="i4">Beneath her steady ray</l>
<l rend="i4">The desert circle spreads,</l>
<l rend="i0">Like the round ocean, girdled with the sky.</l>
<l rend="i4">How beautiful is night!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Who at this untimely hour</l>
<l rend="i2">Wanders o'er the desert sands?</l>
<l rend="i4">No station is in view,</l>
<l rend="i0">No palm-grove islanded amid the waste.</l>
<l rend="i4">The mother and her child,</l>
<l rend="i0">The widow and the orphan at this hour</l>
<l rend="i2">Wander o'er the desert sands.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Alas! the setting sun</l>
<l rend="i4">Saw Zeinab in her bliss,</l>
<l rend="i4">Hodeirah's wife beloved.</l>
<l rend="i4">Alas! the wife beloved,</l>
<l rend="i4">The fruitful mother late,</l>
<l rend="i0">Whom when the daughters of Arabia named</l>
<l rend="i4">They wished their lot like her's;</l>
<l rend="i2">She wanders o'er the desert sands</l>
<l rend="i4">A wretched widow now,</l>
<l rend="i0">The fruitful mother of so fair a race,</l>
<l rend="i4">With only one preserved,</l>
<l rend="i2">She wanders o'er the wilderness.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">No tear relieved the burthen of her heart;</l>
<l rend="i0">Stunned with the heavy woe she felt like one</l>
<l rend="i0">Half-wakened from a midnight dream of blood.</l>
<l rend="i4">But sometimes when her boy</l>
<l rend="i4">Would wet her hand with tears,</l>
<l rend="i0">And looking up to her fixed countenance,</l>
<l rend="i4">Amid his bursting sobs</l>
<l rend="i0">Say the dear name of <hi rend="smallcap">Mother</hi>, then would she</l>
<l rend="i4">Utter a feeble groan.</l>
<l rend="i0">At length collecting, Zeinab turned her eyes</l>
<l rend="i0">To heaven, exclaiming, "praised be the Lord!</l>
<l rend="i4">"He gave,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> he takes away,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Lord our God is good!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"Good is he?" cried the boy,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Why are my brethren and my sisters slain?</l>
<l rend="i4">"Why is my father killed?</l>
<l rend="i2">"Did ever we neglect our prayers,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Or ever lift a hand unclean to heaven?</l>
<l rend="i2">"Did ever stranger from our tent</l>
<l rend="i4">"Unwelcomed turn away?</l>
<l rend="i4">"Mother, he is not good!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Then Zeinab beat her breast in agony,</l>
<l rend="i4">"O God forgive my child!</l>
<l rend="i4">"He knows not what he says!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Thou know'st I did not teach him thoughts like these,</l>
<l rend="i2">"O Prophet, pardon him!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">She had not wept till that assuaging prayer....</l>
<l rend="i0">The fountains of her eyes were opened then,</l>
<l rend="i4">And tears relieved her heart.</l>
<l rend="i2">She raised her swimming eyes to Heaven,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Allah, thy will be done!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Beneath the dispensation of thy wrath</l>
<l rend="i4">"I groan, but murmur not.</l>
<l rend="i2">"The Day of the Trial will come,</l>
<l rend="i0">"When I shall understand how profitable</l>
<l rend="i4">"It is to suffer now."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Young Thalaba in silence heard reproof,</l>
<l rend="i2">His brow in manly frowns was knit,</l>
<l rend="i2">With manly thoughts his heart was full.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Tell me who slew my father?" cried the boy.</l>
<l rend="i4">Zeinab replied and said,</l>
<l rend="i0">"I knew not that there lived thy father's foe.</l>
<l rend="i2">"The blessings of the poor for him</l>
<l rend="i4">"Went daily up to Heaven,</l>
<l rend="i0">"In distant lands the traveller told his praise.</l>
<l rend="i4">"I did not think there lived</l>
<l rend="i4">"Hodeirah's enemy."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"But I will hunt him thro' the earth!"</l>
<l rend="i4">Young Thalaba exclaimed.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Already I can bend my father's bow,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Soon will my arm have strength</l>
<l rend="i0">"To drive the arrow-feathers to his heart."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Zeinab replied, "O Thalaba, my child,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Thou lookest on to distant days,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And we are in the desert far from men!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Not till that moment her afflicted heart</l>
<l rend="i4">Had leisure for the thought.</l>
<l rend="i4">She cast her eyes around,</l>
<l rend="i4">Alas! no tents were there</l>
<l rend="i4">Beside the bending sands;</l>
<l rend="i0">No palm tree rose to spot the wilderness.</l>
<l rend="i4">The dark blue sky closed round</l>
<l rend="i4">And rested<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> like a dome</l>
<l rend="i4">Upon the circling waste.</l>
<l rend="i4">She cast her eyes around,</l>
<l rend="i4">Famine and Thirst were there.</l>
<l rend="i2">Then the mother bowed her head,</l>
<l rend="i4">And wept upon her child.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i3">... Sudden a cry of wonder</l>
<l rend="i4">From Thalaba aroused her,</l>
<l rend="i4">She raised her head, and saw</l>
<l rend="i0">Where high in air a stately palace rose.</l>
<l rend="i4">Amid a grove embowered</l>
<l rend="i4">Stood the prodigious pile,</l>
<l rend="i2">Trees of such ancient majesty</l>
<l rend="i2">Towered not on Yemen's happy hills,</l>
<l rend="i0">Nor crowned the stately brow of Lebanon.</l>
<l rend="i0">Fabric so vast, so lavishly enriched,</l>
<l rend="i0">For Idol, or for Tyrant, never yet</l>
<l rend="i4">Raised the slave race of men</l>
<l rend="i0">In Rome, nor in the elder Babylon,</l>
<l rend="i4">Nor old Persepolis,</l>
<l rend="i2">Nor where the family of Greece</l>
<l rend="i4">Hymned Eleutherian Jove.</l>
<l rend="i2">Here studding azure<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> tablatures</l>
<l rend="i4">And rayed with feeble light,</l>
<l rend="i0">Star-like the ruby and the diamond shone:</l>
<l rend="i4">Here on the golden towers</l>
<l rend="i4">The yellow moon-beam lay;</l>
<l rend="i0">Here with white splendour floods the silver wall.</l>
<l rend="i0">Less wonderous pile and less magnificent</l>
<l rend="i0">Sennamar<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> built at Hirah, tho' his art</l>
<l rend="i0">Sealed with one stone the ample edifice</l>
<l rend="i0">And made its colours, like the serpents skin</l>
<l rend="i0">Play with a changeful beauty: him, its Lord</l>
<l rend="i0">Jealous lest after-effort might surpass</l>
<l rend="i0">The now unequalled palace, from its height</l>
<l rend="i4">Dashed on the pavement down.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">They entered, and through aromatic paths</l>
<l rend="i4">Wondering they went along.</l>
<l rend="i2">At length upon a mossy bank</l>
<l rend="i2">Beneath a tall mimosa's shade</l>
<l rend="i0">That o'er him bent its living canopy,</l>
<l rend="i4">They saw a man reclined.</l>
<l rend="i0">Young he appeared, for on his cheek there shone</l>
<l rend="i4">The morning glow of health,</l>
<l rend="i0">And the brown beard curled close around his chin.</l>
<l rend="i4">He slept, but at the sound</l>
<l rend="i0">Of coming feet awakening, fixed his eyes</l>
<l rend="i0">In wonder, on the wanderer and her child.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Forgive us," Zeinab cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Distress hath made us bold.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Relieve the widow and the fatherless.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Blessed are they who succour the distrest</l>
<l rend="i0">"For them hath God appointed Paradise."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">He heard, and he looked up to heaven,</l>
<l rend="i4">And tears ran down his cheeks:</l>
<l rend="i4">"It is a human voice!</l>
<l rend="i4">"I thank thee, O my God!</l>
<l rend="i4">"How many an age has past</l>
<l rend="i0">"Since the sweet sounds have visited mine ear!</l>
<l rend="i4">"I thank thee, O my God,</l>
<l rend="i4">"It is a human voice!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">To Zeinab turning then he cried</l>
<l rend="i4">"O mortal who art thou</l>
<l rend="i4">"Whose gifted eyes have pierced</l>
<l rend="i0">"The shadow of concealment that hath wrapt</l>
<l rend="i4">"These bowers, so many an age,</l>
<l rend="i4">"From eye of mortal man?</l>
<l rend="i4">"For countless years have past</l>
<l rend="i4">"And never foot of man</l>
<l rend="i4">"The bowers of Irem trod.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Save only I, a miserable wretch</l>
<l rend="i4">"From Heaven and Earth shut out!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Fearless, and scarce surprized,</l>
<l rend="i4">For grief in Zeinab's soul</l>
<l rend="i0">All other feebler feelings overpowered,</l>
<l rend="i4">She answered, "Yesterday</l>
<l rend="i4">"I was a wife beloved,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The fruitful mother of a numerous race.</l>
<l rend="i4">"I am a widow now,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Of all my offspring this alone is left.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Praise to the Lord our God,</l>
<l rend="i4">"He gave, he takes away!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Then said the stranger, "Not by Heaven unseen</l>
<l rend="i4">"Nor with unguided feet</l>
<l rend="i2">"Thy steps have reached this secret place</l>
<l rend="i2">"Nor for light purpose is the Veil,</l>
<l rend="i0">"That from the Universe hath long shut out</l>
<l rend="i4">"These ancient bowers, withdrawn.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Hear thou my words, O mortal, in thy heart</l>
<l rend="i2">"Treasure the wonders I shall tell;</l>
<l rend="i4">"And when amid the world</l>
<l rend="i4">"Thou shall emerge again</l>
<l rend="i4">"Repeat the warning tale.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Why have the Fathers suffered, but to make</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Children wisely safe?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"The Paradise of Irem<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> this,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And that the palace pile</l>
<l rend="i4">"Which Shedad built, the King.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Alas! in the days of my youth</l>
<l rend="i2">"The hum of the populous world</l>
<l rend="i2">"Was heard in yon wilderness waste!</l>
<l rend="i4">"O'er all the winding sands<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></l>
<l rend="i4">"The tents of Ad were pitch'd;</l>
<l rend="i4">"Happy Al-Ahkaf then,</l>
<l rend="i2">"For many and brave were her sons,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Her daughters were many and fair.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"My name was Aswad then.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Alas! alas! how strange</l>
<l rend="i4">"The sound so long unheard!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Of noble race I came,</l>
<l rend="i0">"One of the wealthy of the earth my Sire,</l>
<l rend="i0">"An hundred horses in my father's stalls</l>
<l rend="i4">"Stood ready for his will;</l>
<l rend="i4">"Numerous his robes of silk,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The number of his camels was not known.</l>
<l rend="i4">"These were my heritance,</l>
<l rend="i4">"O God! thy gifts were these;</l>
<l rend="i0">"But better had it been for Aswad's soul</l>
<l rend="i4">"To have asked alms on earth,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And begged the crumbs that from his table fell,</l>
<l rend="i4">"So he had known thy word.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"Boy who hast reached this solitude,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Fear the Lord in the days of thy youth!</l>
<l rend="i4">"My knee was never taught</l>
<l rend="i4">"To bend before my God,</l>
<l rend="i4">"My voice was never taught</l>
<l rend="i4">"To shape one holy prayer.</l>
<l rend="i2">"We worshipped Idols, wood and stone,</l>
<l rend="i2">"The work of our own foolish hands</l>
<l rend="i2">"We worshipped in our foolishness.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Vainly the Prophet's voice</l>
<l rend="i4">"Its frequent warning raised,</l>
<l rend="i4">"<hi rend="smallcap">Repent, and be forgiven!</hi>"—</l>
<l rend="i2">"We mocked the messenger of God,</l>
<l rend="i0">"We mocked the Lord, long-suffering, slow to wrath.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"A mighty work the pride of Shedad planned,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Here in the wilderness to form</l>
<l rend="i2">"A garden more surpassing fair</l>
<l rend="i4">"Than that before whose gate,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The lightning of the Cherub's fiery sword</l>
<l rend="i4">"Waves wide to bar access</l>
<l rend="i0">"Since Adam, the transgressor, thence was driven.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Here too would Shedad build</l>
<l rend="i4">"A kingly pile sublime,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The palace of his pride.</l>
<l rend="i4">"For this exhausted mines</l>
<l rend="i4">"Supplied their golden store,</l>
<l rend="i0">"For this the central caverns gave their gems;</l>
<l rend="i4">"For this the woodman's axe</l>
<l rend="i0">"Opened the cedar forest to the sun;</l>
<l rend="i4">"The silkworm of the East</l>
<l rend="i4">"Spun her sepulchral egg;</l>
<l rend="i4">"The hunter African</l>
<l rend="i0">"Provoked the danger of the elephant's wrath;</l>

<l rend="i2">"That deep-inearthed, and hating light,</l>
<l rend="i0">"A leafless tree and barren of all fruit,</l>
<l rend="i0">"With darkness feeds her boughs of raven grain....</l>
<l rend="i0">"Such were the treasures lavished in yon pile;</l>
<l rend="i4">"Ages have past away</l>

<l rend="i2">"All trees that bend with luscious fruit,</l>

<l rend="i2">"Or point their spiring heads to heaven,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Or spreading wide their shadowy arms</l>
<l rend="i0">"Invite the traveller to repose at noon,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Hither, uprooted with their native soil,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The labour and the pain of multitudes,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Mature in beauty, bore them.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Here, frequent in the walks</l>
<l rend="i4">"The marble statue stood</l>
<l rend="i4">"Of heroes and of chiefs.</l>
<l rend="i4">"The trees and flowers remain</l>
<l rend="i0">"By Nature's care perpetuate and self-sown.</l>
<l rend="i0">"The marble statues long have lost all trace</l>
<l rend="i4">"Of heroes and of chiefs,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Huge shapeless stones they lie</l>
<l rend="i4">"O'er-grown with many a flower.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"The work of pride went on....</l>
<l rend="i4">"Often the Prophet's voice</l>
<l rend="i4">"Denounced impending woe....</l>
<l rend="i2">"We mocked at the words of the Seer.</l>
<l rend="i2">"We mocked at the wrath of the Lord.</l>
<l rend="i0">"A long continued drought first troubled us,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Three years no cloud had formed,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Three years no rain had fallen.</l>
<l rend="i4">"The wholesome herb was dry,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The corn matured not for the food of man,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The wells and fountains failed.</l>
<l rend="i0">"O hard of heart, in whom the punishment</l>
<l rend="i4">"Awoke no sense of guilt!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Headstrong to ruin, obstinately blind,</l>
<l rend="i2">"To Idols<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> we applied for aid;</l>
<l rend="i2">"Sakia we invoked for rain,</l>
<l rend="i2">"We called on Razeka for food....</l>
<l rend="i0">"They did not hear our prayers, they could not hear!</l>
<l rend="i4">"No cloud appeared in Heaven,</l>
<l rend="i4">"No nightly dews came down.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Then to the place of concourse,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> messengers</l>
<l rend="i0">"Were sent to Mecca, where the nations came,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Round the Red Hillock, kneeling, to implore</l>
<l rend="i4">"God in his favoured place,</l>
<l rend="i4">"We sent to call on God;</l>
<l rend="i0">"Ah fools! unthinking that from all the earth</l>
<l rend="i4">"The heart ascends to him.</l>
<l rend="i4">"We sent to call on God;</l>
<l rend="i4">"Ah fools! to think the Lord</l>
<l rend="i4">"Would hear their prayers abroad</l>
<l rend="i4">"Who made no prayers at home!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"Meantime the work of pride went on,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And still before our Idols, wood and stone,</l>
<l rend="i4">"We bowed the impious knee.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Turn men of Ad, and call upon the Lord,"</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Prophet Houd exclaimed.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Turn men of Ad and look to Heaven,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And fly the wrath to come.</l>
<l rend="i4">"We mocked the Prophet's words;</l>
<l rend="i4">"Now dost thou dream old man.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Or art thou drunk with wine?</l>
<l rend="i2">"Future woe and wrath to come,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Still thy prudent voice forebodes;</l>
<l rend="i2">"When it comes will we believe,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Till it comes will we go on</l>
<l rend="i2">"In the way our fathers went.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Now are thy words from God?</l>
<l rend="i4">"Or dost thou dream, old man,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Or art thou drunk with wine?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"So spake the stubborn race</l>
<l rend="i4">"The unbelieving ones,</l>
<l rend="i0">"I too of stubborn unbelieving heart</l>
<l rend="i4">"Heard him and heeded not.</l>
<l rend="i0">"It chanced my father went the way of man,</l>
<l rend="i4">"He perished in his sins.</l>
<l rend="i2">"The funeral rites were duly paid,</l>
<l rend="i2">"We bound a camel to his grave</l>
<l rend="i4">"And left it there to die,</l>
<l rend="i2">"So if the resurrection<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> came</l>
<l rend="i4">"Together they might rise.</l>
<l rend="i4">"I past my father's grave,</l>
<l rend="i4">"I heard the Camel moan.</l>
<l rend="i4">"She was his favourite beast,</l>
<l rend="i0">"One that carried me in infancy,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The first that by myself I learnt to mount.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Her limbs were lean with famine, and her eyes</l>
<l rend="i4">"Looked ghastlily with want.</l>
<l rend="i4">"She knew me as I past,</l>
<l rend="i4">"She stared<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> me in the face,</l>
<l rend="i0">"My heart was touched, had it been human else?</l>
<l rend="i0">"I thought no eye was near, and broke her bonds,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And drove her forth to liberty and life.</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Prophet Houd beheld,</l>
<l rend="i4">"He lifted up his voice,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Blessed art thou, young man,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Blessed art thou, O Aswad, for the deed!</l>
<l rend="i2">"In the day of visitation,</l>
<l rend="i2">"In the fearful hour of judgment,</l>
<l rend="i4">"God will remember thee!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"The day of visitation was at hand,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The fearful hour of judgment hastened on.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Lo Shedad's mighty pile complete,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The palace of his pride.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Would ye behold its wonders, enter in!</l>
<l rend="i2">"I have no heart to visit it!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Time hath not harmed the eternal monument,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Time is not here, nor days, nor months, nor years,</l>
<l rend="i0">"An everlasting <hi rend="smallcap">now</hi> of misery!...</l>
<l rend="i4">"Ye must have heard their fame,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Or likely ye have seen</l>
<l rend="i4">"The mighty Pyramids,</l>
<l rend="i0">"For sure those mighty piles shall overlive</l>
<l rend="i0">"The feeble generations of mankind.</l>
<l rend="i0">"What tho' unmoved they bore<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> the deluge weight,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Survivors of the ruined world?</l>
<l rend="i0">"What tho' their founder filled with miracles</l>
<l rend="i0">"And wealth miraculous their ample vaults?</l>
<l rend="i0">"Compared with yonder fabric, and they shrink</l>
<l rend="i0">"The baby wonders of a woman's work!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Her emerald columns o'er the marble courts</l>
<l rend="i0">"Fling their green rays, as when amid a shower</l>
<l rend="i0">"The sun shines loveliest on the vernal corn.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Here Shedad bade the sapphire floor be laid,</l>
<l rend="i4">"As tho' with feet divine</l>
<l rend="i4">"To trample azure light,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Like the blue pavement of the firmament.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Here self-suspended hangs in air,</l>
<l rend="i0">"As its pure substance loathed material touch,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The living<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> carbuncle;</l>
<l rend="i4">"Sun of the lofty dome</l>
<l rend="i0">"Darkness has no dominion o'er its beams;</l>
<l rend="i0">"Intense it glows, an ever-flowing tide</l>
<l rend="i0">"Of glory, like the day-flood in its source.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Impious! the Trees of vegetable gold,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Such as in Eden's groves</l>
<l rend="i4">"Yet innocent it<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> grew,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Impious! he made his boast, tho' heaven had hidden</l>
<l rend="i4">"So deep the baneful ore,</l>
<l rend="i2">"That they should branch and bud for him,</l>
<l rend="i0">"That art should force their blossoms and their fruit,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And re-create for him,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Whate'er was lost in Paradise.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Therefore at Shedad's voice</l>
<l rend="i0">"Here towered the palm, a silver trunk,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The fine gold net-work<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> growing out</l>
<l rend="i4">"Loose from its rugged boughs.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Tall as the Cedar of the mountain, here</l>
<l rend="i0">"Rose the gold branches, hung with emerald leaves,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Blossomed with pearls, and rich with ruby fruit,</l>
<l rend="i0">"O Ad! my country! evil was the day</l>
<l rend="i4">"That thy unhappy sons</l>
<l rend="i4">"Crouched at this Nimrod's throne,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></l>
<l rend="i0">"And placed him on the pedestal of power,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And laid their liberties beneath his feet,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Robbing their children of the heritance</l>
<l rend="i4">"Their fathers handed down.</l>
<l rend="i2">"What was to him the squandered wealth?</l>
<l rend="i0">"What was to him the burthen of the land,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The lavished misery?</l>
<l rend="i4">"He did but speak his will,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And like the blasting Siroc of the East,</l>
<l rend="i2">"The ruin of the royal voice</l>
<l rend="i4">"Found its way every-where.</l>
<l rend="i2">"I marvel not that he, whose power</l>
<l rend="i0">"No earthly law, no human feeling curbed,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Mocked at the living God!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"And now the King's command went forth</l>
<l rend="i0">"Among the people, bidding old and young,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Husband and wife, the master and the slave,</l>
<l rend="i0">"All the collected multitudes of Ad,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Here to repair, and hold high festival,</l>
<l rend="i0">"That he might see his people, they behold</l>
<l rend="i2">"Their King's magnificence and power.</l>
<l rend="i2">"The day of festival arrived,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Hither they came, the old man and the boy,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Husband and wife, the master and the slave,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Hither they came. From yonder high tower top,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The loftiest of the Palace, Shedad looked</l>
<l rend="i0">"Down on his tribe: their tents on yonder sands</l>
<l rend="i0">"Rose like the countless billows of the sea.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Their tread and voices like the ocean roar,</l>
<l rend="i0">"One deep confusion of tumultuous sounds.</l>
<l rend="i0">"They saw their King's magnificence; beheld</l>
<l rend="i0">"His Palace sparkling like the Angel domes</l>
<l rend="i0">"Of Paradise; his garden like the bowers</l>
<l rend="i0">"Of early Eden, and they shouted out</l>
<l rend="i0">"Great is the King, a God upon the earth!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"Intoxicate with joy and pride</l>
<l rend="i4">"He heard their blasphemies,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And in his wantonness of heart he bade</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Prophet Houd be brought,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And o'er the marble courts,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And o'er the gorgeous rooms</l>
<l rend="i4">"Glittering with gems and gold,</l>
<l rend="i4">"He led the Man of God.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Is not this a stately pile?"</l>
<l rend="i2">"Cried the Monarch in his joy.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Hath ever eye beheld,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Hath ever thought conceived,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Place more magnificent?</l>
<l rend="i2">"Houd, they saw that Heaven imparted</l>
<l rend="i2">"To thy lips the words of wisdom!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Look at the riches round</l>
<l rend="i4">"And value them aright,</l>
<l rend="i4">"If so thy wisdom can."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"The Prophet heard his vaunt</l>
<l rend="i2">"And answered with an aweful smile,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Costly thy palace King!</l>
<l rend="i2">"But only in the hour<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> of death</l>
<l rend="i0">"Man learns to value things like these aright.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"Hast thou a fault to find</l>
<l rend="i4">"In all thine eyes have seen?</l>
<l rend="i4">"Again the King exclaimed.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Yes!" said the man of God;</l>
<l rend="i0">"The walls are weak, the building ill secured.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Azrael can enter in!</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Sarsar can pierce thro',</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Icy Wind of Death.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"I was beside the Monarch when he spake....</l>
<l rend="i4">"Gentle the Prophet spake,</l>
<l rend="i4">"But in his eye there dwelt</l>
<l rend="i0">"A sorrow that disturbed me while I gazed,</l>
<l rend="i2">"The countenance of Shedad fell,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And anger sate upon his paler lips.</l>
<l rend="i0">"He to the high tower top the Prophet led,</l>
<l rend="i2">"And pointed to the multitude,</l>
<l rend="i2">"And as again they shouted out</l>
<l rend="i0">"Great is the King! a God upon the Earth!"</l>
<l rend="i2">"Turned with a threatful smile to Houd,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Say they aright, O Prophet? is the King</l>
<l rend="i0">"Great upon earth, a God among mankind?"</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Prophet answered not,</l>
<l rend="i0">"His eye rolled round the infinite multitude,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And into tears he burst.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"Sudden an uproar rose,</l>
<l rend="i4">"A cry of joy below,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Messenger is come!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Kail from Mecca comes,</l>
<l rend="i4">"He brings the boon obtained!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Forth as we went we saw where overhead</l>
<l rend="i4">"There hung a deep black cloud,</l>
<l rend="i4">"On which the multitude</l>
<l rend="i4">"With joyful eyes looked up</l>
<l rend="i4">"And blest the coming rain.</l>
<l rend="i2">"The Messenger addrest the King</l>
<l rend="i4">"And told his tale of joy.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"To Mecca I repaired,</l>
<l rend="i4">"By the Red Hillock knelt</l>
<l rend="i4">"And called on God for rain.</l>
<l rend="i2">"My prayer ascended and was heard;</l>
<l rend="i4">"Three clouds appeared in heaven.</l>
<l rend="i0">"One white, and like the flying cloud of noon,</l>
<l rend="i0">"One red as it had drunk the evening beams,</l>
<l rend="i0">"One black and heavy with its load of rain.</l>
<l rend="i4">"A voice went forth from heaven</l>
<l rend="i4">"Chuse Kail of the three!"</l>
<l rend="i4">"I thanked the gracious Power,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And chose the black cloud, heavy with its wealth."</l>
<l rend="i2">"Right! right! a thousand tongues exclaimed,</l>
<l rend="i2">"And all was merriment and joy.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Then stood the Prophet up and cried aloud,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Woe, woe, to Irem! woe to Ad!</l>
<l rend="i0">"<hi rend="smallcap">Death</hi> is gone up into her palaces!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Woe! woe! a day of guilt and punishment,</l>
<l rend="i0">"A day of desolation!"</l>
<l rend="i8">"As he spake</l>
<l rend="i0">"His large eye rolled in horror, and so deep</l>
<l rend="i0">"His tone, it seemed some Spirit from within</l>
<l rend="i0">"Breathed thro' his moveless lips<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> the unearthly voice.</l>
<l rend="i0">"All looks were turned to him. "O Ad!" he cried,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Dear native land, by all rememberances</l>
<l rend="i0">"Of childhood, by all joys of manhood dear;</l>
<l rend="i0">"O Vale of many Waters! morn and night</l>
<l rend="i0">"My age must groan for you, and to the grave</l>
<l rend="i0">"Go down in sorrow. Thou wilt give thy fruits,</l>
<l rend="i0">"But who shall gather them? thy grapes will ripen,</l>
<l rend="i0">"But who shall tread the wine-press? Fly the wrath,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Ye who would live and save your souls alive!</l>
<l rend="i0">"For strong is his right hand that bends the Bow,</l>
<l rend="i2">"The Arrows that he shoots are sharp,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And err not from their aim!"<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"With that, a faithful few</l>
<l rend="i0">"Prest thro' the throng to join him. Then arose</l>
<l rend="i0">"Mockery and mirth; "go bald head!" and they mixed</l>
<l rend="i0">"Curses with laughter. He set forth, yet once</l>
<l rend="i0">"Looked back,—his eye fell on me, and he called</l>
<l rend="i0">"Aswad!"... it startled me,... it terrified,...</l>
<l rend="i0">"Aswad!" again he called,... and I almost</l>
<l rend="i0">"Had followed him. O moment fled too soon!</l>
<l rend="i0">"O moment irrecoverably lost!</l>
<l rend="i0">"The shouts of mockery made a coward of me;</l>
<l rend="i0">"He went, and I remained, in fear of <hi rend="smallcap">Man</hi>!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"He went, and darker grew</l>
<l rend="i4">"The deepening cloud above.</l>
<l rend="i0">"At length it opened, and.... O God! O God!</l>
<l rend="i4">"There were no waters there!</l>
<l rend="i4">"There fell no kindly rain!</l>
<l rend="i2">"The Sarsar from its womb went forth,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Icy Wind of Death."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"They fell around me, thousands fell around,</l>
<l rend="i2">"The King and all his People fell.</l>
<l rend="i4">"All! all! they perished all!</l>
<l rend="i4">"I ... only I ... was left.</l>
<l rend="i2">"There came a Voice to me and said,</l>
<l rend="i2">"In the Day of Visitation,</l>
<l rend="i2">"In the fearful Hour of Judgement,</l>
<l rend="i4">"God hath remembered thee."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"When from an agony of prayer I rose</l>
<l rend="i4">"And from the scene of death</l>
<l rend="i4">"Attempted to go forth,</l>
<l rend="i2">"The way was open, I beheld</l>
<l rend="i4">"No barrier to my steps.</l>
<l rend="i2">"But round these bowers the Arm of God</l>
<l rend="i4">"Had drawn a mighty chain,</l>
<l rend="i0">"A barrier that no human force might break.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Twice I essayed to pass.</l>
<l rend="i4">"With that the voice was heard,</l>
<l rend="i0">"O Aswad be content, and bless the Lord!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"One righteous deed hath saved</l>
<l rend="i4">"Thy soul from utter death.</l>
<l rend="i4">"O Aswad, sinful man!</l>
<l rend="i4">"When by long penitence</l>
<l rend="i4">"Thou feelest thy soul prepared,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Breathe up the wish to die,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And Azrael comes, obedient to the prayer."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"A miserable man</l>
<l rend="i4">"From Earth and Heaven shut out,</l>
<l rend="i4">"I heard the dreadful voice.</l>
<l rend="i2">"I looked around my prison place,</l>
<l rend="i2">"The bodies of the dead were there,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Where'er I looked they lay.</l>
<l rend="i4">"They mouldered, mouldered here,...</l>
<l rend="i0">"Their very bones have crumbled into dust,</l>
<l rend="i4">"So many years have past!</l>
<l rend="i0">"So many weary ages have gone by!</l>
<l rend="i4">"And still I linger here!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Still groaning with the burthen of my sins</l>
<l rend="i4">"Have never dared to breathe</l>
<l rend="i4">"The prayer to be released."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Oh! who can tell the unspeakable misery</l>
<l rend="i4">"Of solitude like this!</l>
<l rend="i2">"No sound hath ever reached my ear</l>
<l rend="i4">"Save of the passing wind....</l>
<l rend="i2">"The fountain's everlasting flow;</l>
<l rend="i4">"The forest in the gale,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The pattering of the shower,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Sounds dead and mournful all.</l>
<l rend="i2">"No bird hath ever closed her wing</l>
<l rend="i2">"Upon these solitary bowers,</l>
<l rend="i0">"No insect sweetly buzzed amid these groves,</l>
<l rend="i4">"From all things that have life,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Save only me, concealed.</l>
<l rend="i2">"This Tree alone that o'er my head</l>
<l rend="i2">"Hangs, down its hospitable boughs,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And bends its whispering leaves</l>
<l rend="i4">"As tho' to welcome me,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Seems to partake<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> of life;</l>
<l rend="i0">"I love it as my friend, my only friend!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"I know not for what ages I have dragged</l>
<l rend="i4">"This miserable life,</l>
<l rend="i4">"How often I have seen</l>
<l rend="i4">"These antient trees renewed,</l>
<l rend="i0">"What countless generations of mankind</l>
<l rend="i4">"Have risen and fallen asleep,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And I remain the same!</l>
<l rend="i2">"My garment hath not waxed old,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Nor the sole of my shoe hath worn.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"I dare not breathe the prayer to die,</l>
<l rend="i4">"O merciful Lord God!...</l>
<l rend="i4">"But when it is thy will,</l>
<l rend="i4">"But when I have atoned</l>
<l rend="i4">"For mine iniquities,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And sufferings have made pure</l>
<l rend="i4">"My soul with sin defiled,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Release me in thine own good time,...</l>
<l rend="i0">"I will not cease to praise thee, O my God!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Silence ensued awhile,</l>
<l rend="i4">Then Zeinab answered him.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Blessed art thou, O Aswad! for the Lord</l>
<l rend="i4">"Who saved thy soul from Hell,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Will call thee to him in his own good time.</l>
<l rend="i4">"And would that when my heart</l>
<l rend="i4">"Breathed up the wish to die,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Azrael might visit me!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Then would I follow where my babes are gone,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And join Hodeirah now!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">She ceased, and the rushing of wings</l>
<l rend="i2">Was heard in the stillness of night,</l>
<l rend="i0">And Azrael, the Death-Angel stood before them.</l>
<l rend="i4">His countenance was dark,</l>
<l rend="i4">Solemn, but not severe,</l>
<l rend="i0">It awed but struck no terror to the heart.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Zeinab, thy wish is heard!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Aswad, thy hour is come!"</l>
<l rend="i0">They fell upon the ground and blest the voice,</l>
<l rend="i4">And Azrael from his sword</l>
<l rend="i0">Let drop<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> the drops of bitterness and death.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Me too! me too!" young Thalaba exclaimed:</l>
<l rend="i4">As wild with grief he kissed</l>
<l rend="i4">His Mother's livid hand,</l>
<l rend="i4">His Mother's quivering lips,</l>
<l rend="i4">"O Angel! take me too!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Son of Hodeirah!" the Death-Angel cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"It is not yet the hour.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Son of Hodeirah, thou art chosen forth</l>
<l rend="i4">"To do the will of Heaven;</l>
<l rend="i4">"To avenge thy Father's death,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The murder of thy race,</l>
<l rend="i2">"To work the mightiest enterprise</l>
<l rend="i4">"That mortal man hath wrought.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Live! and remember Destiny</l>
<l rend="i4">"Hath marked thee from mankind!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">He ceased, and he was gone.</l>
<l rend="i4">Young Thalaba looked round,...</l>
<l rend="i0">The Palace and the groves were seen no more,</l>
<l rend="i0">He stood amid the Wilderness, alone.</l>

<lg>
<l rend="i4">Not in the desert</l>
<l rend="i4">Son of Hodeirah</l>
<l rend="i4">Wert thou abandoned!</l>
<l rend="i4">The coexistent fire,</l>
<l rend="i0">That in the Dens of Darkness burnt for thee,</l>
<l rend="i4">Burns yet, and yet shall burn.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">In the Domdaniel caverns</l>
<l rend="i2">Under the Roots of the Ocean,</l>
<l rend="i4">Met the Masters of the Spell.</l>
<l rend="i4">Before them in the vault,</l>
<l rend="i0">Blazing unfuelled from the floor of rock,</l>
<l rend="i4">Ten magic flames arose.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Burn mystic fires!" Abdaldar cried,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Burn whilst Hodeirah's dreaded race exist.</l>
<l rend="i4">"This is the appointed hour,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The hour that shall secure these dens of night."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"Dim they burn," exclaimed Lobaba,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Dim they burn, and now they waver!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Okba lifts the arm of death,</l>
<l rend="i4">"They waver,... they go out!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"Curse on his hasty hand!"</l>
<l rend="i4">Khawla exclaimed in wrath,</l>
<l rend="i4">The woman-fiend exclaimed,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Curse on his hasty hand, the fool hath failed!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Eight only are gone out."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">A Teraph<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> stood against the cavern side,</l>
<l rend="i4">A new-born infant's head,</l>
<l rend="i0">That Khawla at his hour of birth had seized</l>
<l rend="i4">And from the shoulders wrung.</l>
<l rend="i2">It stood upon a plate of gold,</l>
<l rend="i0">An unclean Spirit's name inscribed beneath.</l>
<l rend="i4">The cheeks were deathy dark,</l>
<l rend="i0">Dark the dead skin upon the hairless skull;</l>
<l rend="i4">The lips were bluey pale;</l>
<l rend="i4">Only the eyes had life,</l>
<l rend="i4">They gleamed with demon light.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Tell me!" quoth Khawla, "is the Fire gone out</l>
<l rend="i2">"That threats the Masters of the Spell?"</l>
<l rend="i4">The dead lips moved and spake,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Fire still burns that threats</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Masters of the Spell."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"Curse on thee, Okba!" Khawla cried,</l>
<l rend="i2">As to the den the Sorcerer came,</l>
<l rend="i2">He bore the dagger in his hand</l>
<l rend="i0">Hot from the murder of Hodeirah's race.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Behold those unextinguished flames!</l>
<l rend="i4">"The fire still burns that threats</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Masters of the Spell!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Okba, wert thou weak of heart?</l>
<l rend="i4">"Okba, wert thou blind of eye?</l>
<l rend="i2">"Thy fate and ours were on the lot,</l>
<l rend="i2">"And we believed the lying stars</l>
<l rend="i0">"That said thy hand might seize the auspicious hour!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Thou hast let slip the reins of Destiny,...</l>
<l rend="i4">"Curse thee, curse thee, Okba!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The Murderer answering said,</l>
<l rend="i2">"O versed in all enchanted lore,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Thou better knowest Okba's soul.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Eight blows I struck, eight home-driven blows,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Needed no second stroke</l>
<l rend="i4">"From this envenomed blade.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Ye frown at me as if the will had failed,</l>
<l rend="i4">"As if ye did not know</l>
<l rend="i0">"My double danger from Hodeirah's race,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The deeper hate I feel,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The stronger motive that inspired my arm!</l>
<l rend="i2">"Ye frown as if my hasty fault,</l>
<l rend="i4">"My ill-directed blow</l>
<l rend="i4">"Had spared the enemy,</l>
<l rend="i2">"And not the stars that would not give,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And not your feeble spells</l>
<l rend="i4">"That could not force, the sign</l>
<l rend="i4">"Which of the whole was he!</l>
<l rend="i2">"Did ye not bid me strike them all?</l>
<l rend="i0">"Said ye not root and branch should be destroyed?</l>
<l rend="i2">"I heard Hodeirah's dying groan,</l>
<l rend="i2">"I heard his Children's shriek of death,</l>
<l rend="i2">"And sought to consummate the work,</l>
<l rend="i2">"But o'er the two remaining lives</l>
<l rend="i2">"A cloud unpierceable had risen,</l>
<l rend="i2">"A cloud that mocked my searching eyes.</l>
<l rend="i0">"I would have probed it with the dagger-point,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The dagger was repelled,</l>
<l rend="i4">"A Voice came forth and cried</l>
<l rend="i0">"Son of Perdition, cease! thou canst not change</l>
<l rend="i0">"What in the Book of Destiny is written."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Khawla to the Teraph turned,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Tell me where the Prophet's hand</l>
<l rend="i2">"Hides our destined enemy?"</l>
<l rend="i2">The dead lips spake again,</l>
<l rend="i2">"I view the seas, I view the land,</l>
<l rend="i2">"I search the ocean and the earth!</l>
<l rend="i2">"Not on Ocean is the Boy,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Not on Earth his steps are seen."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"A mightier power than we," Lobaba cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Protects our destined foe!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Look! look! one fire burns dim!</l>
<l rend="i4">"It quivers! it goes out!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">It quivered, it was quenched.</l>
<l rend="i4">One flame alone was left,</l>
<l rend="i0">A pale blue flame that trembled on the earth,</l>
<l rend="i0">A hovering light upon whose shrinking edge</l>
<l rend="i4">The darkness seemed to press.</l>
<l rend="i4">Stronger it grew, and spread</l>
<l rend="i4">Its lucid swell around,</l>
<l rend="i0">Extending now where all the ten had stood,</l>
<l rend="i4">With lustre more than all.</l>
<l rend="i4">At that protentous sight,</l>
<l rend="i2">The children of Evil trembled</l>
<l rend="i4">And Terror smote their souls.</l>
<l rend="i4">Over the den the fire</l>
<l rend="i4">Its fearful splendour cast,</l>
<l rend="i0">The broad base rolling up in wavy streams,</l>
<l rend="i0">Bright as the summer lightning when it spreads</l>
<l rend="i2">Its glory o'er the midnight heaven.</l>
<l rend="i4">The Teraphs eyes were dimmed,</l>
<l rend="i4">That like two twinkling stars</l>
<l rend="i4">Shone in the darkness late.</l>
<l rend="i2">The Sorcerers on each other gazed,</l>
<l rend="i2">And every face all pale with fear,</l>
<l rend="i2">And ghastly in that light was seen</l>
<l rend="i0">Like a dead man's by the sepulchral lamp.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Even Khawla fiercest of the enchanter brood</l>
<l rend="i4">Not without effort drew</l>
<l rend="i4">Her fear suspended breath.</l>
<l rend="i4">Anon a deeper rage</l>
<l rend="i4">Inflamed her reddening eye.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Mighty is thy power, Mohammed!"</l>
<l rend="i2">Loud in blasphemy she cried,</l>
<l rend="i2">"But Eblis<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> would not stoop to man</l>
<l rend="i0">"When Man fair statured as the stately palm,</l>
<l rend="i4">"From his Creator's hand</l>
<l rend="i4">"Was undefiled and pure.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Thou art mighty, O Son of Abdallah!</l>
<l rend="i2">"But who is he of woman born</l>
<l rend="i0">"That shall vie with the might of Eblis?</l>
<l rend="i0">"That shall rival the Prince of the Morning?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">She said, and raised her skinny hand</l>
<l rend="i2">As in defiance to high Heaven,</l>
<l rend="i2">And stretched her long lean finger forth</l>
<l rend="i2">And spake aloud the words of power.</l>
<l rend="i4">The Spirits heard her call,</l>
<l rend="i4">And lo! before her stands</l>
<l rend="i4">Her Demon Minister.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Spirit!" the Enchantress cried,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Where lives the Boy coeval with whose life</l>
<l rend="i4">"Yon magic fire must burn?"</l>
<l rend="i8">DEMON.</l>
<l rend="i2">Mistress of the mighty Spell,</l>
<l rend="i2">Not on Ocean, not on Earth.</l>
<l rend="i4">Only eyes that view</l>
<l rend="i4">Allah's glory throne,</l>
<l rend="i4">See his hiding-place.</l>
<l rend="i0">From some believing Spirit, ask and learn.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"Bring the dead Hodeirah here,"</l>
<l rend="i2">Khawla cried, "and he shall tell."</l>
<l rend="i0">The Demon heard her bidding, and was gone.</l>
<l rend="i2">A moment passed, and at her feet</l>
<l rend="i4">Hodeirah's corpse was laid.</l>
<l rend="i0">His hand still held the sword he grasped in death,</l>
<l rend="i0">The blood not yet had clotted on his wound.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">The Sorceress looked and with a smile</l>
<l rend="i2">That kindled to more fiendishness</l>
<l rend="i4">Her hideous features, cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Where Hodeirah is thy soul?</l>
<l rend="i4">"Is it in the <a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>Zemzem well?</l>
<l rend="i4">"Is it in the Eden groves?</l>
<l rend="i4">"Waits it for the judgement-blast</l>
<l rend="i4">"In the trump of Israfil?</l>
<l rend="i4">"Is it plumed with silver wings</l>
<l rend="i4">"Underneath the throne of God?</l>
<l rend="i4">"Even if beneath his throne</l>
<l rend="i4">"Hodeirah, thou shalt hear,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Thou shalt obey my voice!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">She said, and muttered charms that Hell in fear</l>
<l rend="i4">And Heaven in horror heard.</l>
<l rend="i4">Soon the stiff eye-balls rolled,</l>
<l rend="i0">The muscles with convulsive motion shook,</l>
<l rend="i0">The white lips quivered. Khawla saw, her soul</l>
<l rend="i4">Exulted, and she cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Prophet! behold my power!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Not even death secures</l>
<l rend="i4">"Thy slaves from Khawla's Spell!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Where Hodeirah is thy child?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Hodeirah groaned and closed his eyes,</l>
<l rend="i0">As if in the night and the blindness of death</l>
<l rend="i4">He would have hid himself.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"Speak to my question!" she exclaimed,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Or in that mangled body thou shall live</l>
<l rend="i2">"Ages of torture! answer me!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Where can we find the Boy?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"God! God! Hodeirah cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Release me from this life,</l>
<l rend="i0">"From this intolerable agony!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"Speak!" cried the Sorceress; and she snatched</l>
<l rend="i4">A Viper from the floor,</l>
<l rend="i0">And with the living reptile lashed<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> his neck.</l>
<l rend="i4">Wreathed, round him with the blow,</l>
<l rend="i2">The Reptile tighter drew her folds</l>
<l rend="i4">And raised her wrathful head,</l>
<l rend="i4">And fixed into his face</l>
<l rend="i4">Her deadly teeth, and shed</l>
<l rend="i4">Poison in every wound.</l>
<l rend="i0">In vain! for Allah heard Hodeirah's prayer,</l>
<l rend="i4">And Khawla on a corpse</l>
<l rend="i4">Had wrecked her baffled rage.</l>
<l rend="i4">The fated fire moved on</l>
<l rend="i0">And round the Body wrapt its funeral flames.</l>
<l rend="i0">The flesh and bones in that portentous pile</l>
<l rend="i4">Consumed; the Sword alone,</l>
<l rend="i4">Circled with fire was left.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Where is the Boy for whose hand it is destined?</l>
<l rend="i0">Where the Destroyer who one day shall wield</l>
<l rend="i2">The Sword that is circled with fire?</l>
<l rend="i4">Race accursed, try your charms!</l>
<l rend="i4">Masters of the mighty Spell,</l>
<l rend="i4">Mutter o'er your words of power!</l>
<l rend="i2">Ye can shatter the dwellings of man,</l>
<l rend="i2">Ye can open the womb of the rock,</l>
<l rend="i2">Ye can shake the foundations of earth,</l>
<l rend="i4">But not the Word of God:</l>
<l rend="i2">But not one letter can ye change</l>
<l rend="i4">Of what his Will hath written!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Who shall seek thro' Araby</l>
<l rend="i4">Hodeirah's dreaded son?</l>
<l rend="i2">They mingle the Arrows<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> of Chance</l>
<l rend="i2">The lot of Abdaldar is drawn.</l>
<l rend="i2">Thirteen moons must wax and wane</l>
<l rend="i2">Ere the Sorcerer quit his quest.</l>
<l rend="i2">He must visit every tribe</l>
<l rend="i2">That roam the desert wilderness,</l>
<l rend="i2">Or dwell beside perennial streams;</l>
<l rend="i0">Nor leave a solitary tent unsearched</l>
<l rend="i4">Till he has found the Boy,</l>
<l rend="i2">The hated Boy whose blood alone</l>
<l rend="i4">Can quench that dreaded fire.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">A crystal ring Abdaldar bore,</l>
<l rend="i4">The powerful gem<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> condensed</l>
<l rend="i0">Primeval dews that upon Caucasus</l>
<l rend="i4">Felt the first winter's frost.</l>
<l rend="i4">Ripening there it lay beneath</l>
<l rend="i0">Rock above rock, and mountain ice up-piled</l>
<l rend="i0">On mountain, till the incumbent mass assumed,</l>
<l rend="i0">So huge its bulk, the Ocean's azure hue.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">With this he sought the inner den</l>
<l rend="i4">Where burnt the eternal flame.</l>
<l rend="i0">Like waters gushing from some channelled rock</l>
<l rend="i0">Full thro' a narrow opening, from a chasm</l>
<l rend="i4">The eternal flame streamed up.</l>
<l rend="i4">No eye beheld the fount</l>
<l rend="i4">Of that up-flowing flame,</l>
<l rend="i0">That blazed self-nurtured, and for ever, there.</l>
<l rend="i0">It was no mortal element: the Abyss</l>
<l rend="i0">Supplied it, from the fountains at the first</l>
<l rend="i0">Prepared. In the heart of earth it lives and glows</l>
<l rend="i0">Her vital heat, till at the day decreed,</l>
<l rend="i0">The voice of God shall let its billows loose,</l>
<l rend="i0">To deluge o'er with no abating flood</l>
<l rend="i4">The consummated World;</l>
<l rend="i2">That thenceforth thro' the air must roll,</l>
<l rend="i4">The penal Orb of Fire.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Unturbaned and unsandalled there,</l>
<l rend="i2">Abdaldar stood before the flame,</l>
<l rend="i2">And held the Ring beside, and spake</l>
<l rend="i0">The language that the Elements obey.</l>
<l rend="i0">The obedient flame detatched a portion forth,</l>
<l rend="i0">That, in the crystal entering, was condensed,</l>
<l rend="i0">Gem of the gem, its living Eye of fire.</l>
<l rend="i4">When the hand that wears the spell</l>
<l rend="i4">Shall touch the destined Boy,</l>
<l rend="i4">Then shall that Eye be quenched,</l>
<l rend="i4">And the freed Element</l>
<l rend="i0">Fly to its sacred and remembered Spring.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Now go thy way Abdaldar!</l>
<l rend="i4">Servant of Eblis,</l>
<l rend="i4">Over Arabia</l>
<l rend="i4">Seek the Destroyer!</l>
<l rend="i0">Over the sands of the scorching Tchama,</l>
<l rend="i0">Over the waterless mountains of Naïd,</l>
<l rend="i0">In Arud pursue him; and Yemen the happy,</l>
<l rend="i0">And Hejaz, the country beloved by believers.</l>
<l rend="i4">Over Arabia</l>
<l rend="i4">Servant of Eblis,</l>
<l rend="i4">Seek the Destroyer.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">From tribe to tribe, from town to town,</l>
<l rend="i2">From tent to tent, Abdaldar past.</l>
<l rend="i0">Him every morn the all-beholding Eye</l>
<l rend="i0">Saw from his couch, unhallowed by a prayer,</l>
<l rend="i4">Rise to the scent of blood,</l>
<l rend="i4">And every night lie down.</l>
<l rend="i0">That rankling hope within him, that by day</l>
<l rend="i0">Goaded his steps, still stinging him in sleep,</l>
<l rend="i0">And startling him with vain accomplishment</l>
<l rend="i4">From visions still the same.</l>
<l rend="i4">Many a time his wary hand</l>
<l rend="i2">To many a youth applied the Ring,</l>
<l rend="i0">And still the dagger in his mantle hid</l>
<l rend="i4">Was ready for the deed.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">At length to the cords of a tent</l>
<l rend="i2">That were stretched by an Island of Palms</l>
<l rend="i2">In the desolate sea of the sands,</l>
<l rend="i4">The weary traveller came.</l>
<l rend="i4">Under a shapely palm,</l>
<l rend="i0">Herself as shapely, there a Damsel stood.</l>
<l rend="i4">She held her ready robe</l>
<l rend="i4">And looked towards a Boy,</l>
<l rend="i4">Who from the tree above</l>
<l rend="i2">With one hand clinging to its trunk,</l>
<l rend="i0">Cast with the other down the clustered dates.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The Wizard approached the Tree,</l>
<l rend="i0">He leaned on his staff, like a way-faring man,</l>
<l rend="i0">And the sweat of his travel was seen on his brow.</l>
<l rend="i4">He asks for food, and lo!</l>
<l rend="i0">The Damsel proffers him her lap of dates.</l>
<l rend="i0">And the Stripling descends, and runs into the tent</l>
<l rend="i0">And brings him forth water, the draught of delight.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Anon the Master of the tent,</l>
<l rend="i2">The Father of the family</l>
<l rend="i0">Came forth, a man in years, of aspect mild.</l>
<l rend="i2">To the stranger approaching he gave</l>
<l rend="i2">The friendly saluting of peace,</l>
<l rend="i4">And bade the skin be spread.</l>
<l rend="i2">Before the tent they spread the<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> skin,</l>
<l rend="i4">Under a Tamarind's shade,</l>
<l rend="i4">That bending forward, stretched</l>
<l rend="i4">Its boughs of beauty far.</l>
<l rend="i4">They brought the Traveller rice,</l>
<l rend="i0">With no false colours<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> tinged to tempt the eye,</l>
<l rend="i2">But white as the new-fallen snow,</l>
<l rend="i2">When never yet the sullying Sun</l>
<l rend="i4">Hath seen its purity,</l>
<l rend="i0">Nor the warm Zephyr touched and tainted it.</l>
<l rend="i2">The dates of the grove before their guest</l>
<l rend="i2">They laid, and the luscious fig,</l>
<l rend="i4">And water from the well.</l>
<l rend="i2">The Damsel from the Tamarind tree</l>
<l rend="i4">Had plucked its acid fruit</l>
<l rend="i4">And steeped it in water long;</l>
<l rend="i2">And whoso drank of the cooling<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> draught</l>
<l rend="i4">He would not wish for wine.</l>
<l rend="i2">This to the guest the Damsel brought,</l>
<l rend="i2">And a modest pleasure kindled her cheek,</l>
<l rend="i0">When raising from the cup his moistened lips</l>
<l rend="i0">The Stranger smiled, and praised, and drank again.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Whither is gone the Boy?</l>
<l rend="i2">He had pierced the Melon's pulp</l>
<l rend="i4">And closed with wax the wound,</l>
<l rend="i2">And he had duly gone at morn</l>
<l rend="i4">And watched its ripening rind,</l>
<l rend="i2">And now all joyfully he brings</l>
<l rend="i4">The treasure now matured.</l>
<l rend="i0">His dark eyes sparkle with a boy's delight.</l>
<l rend="i0">As he pours out its liquid<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> lusciousness</l>
<l rend="i4">And proffers to the guest.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Abdaldar ate, and he was satisfied:</l>
<l rend="i4">And now his tongue discoursed</l>
<l rend="i4">Of regions far remote,</l>
<l rend="i0">As one whose busy feet had travelled long.</l>
<l rend="i2">The Father of the family,</l>
<l rend="i2">With a calm eye and quiet smile,</l>
<l rend="i4">Sate pleased to hearken him.</l>
<l rend="i2">The Damsel who removed the meal,</l>
<l rend="i4">She loitered on the way</l>
<l rend="i4">And listened with full <a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>hands</l>
<l rend="i4">A moment motionless.</l>
<l rend="i4">All eagerly the Boy</l>
<l rend="i4">Watches the Traveller's lips,</l>
<l rend="i4">And still the wily man</l>
<l rend="i0">With seemly kindness to the eager Boy</l>
<l rend="i4">Directs his winning tale.</l>
<l rend="i2">Ah, cursed man! if this be he,</l>
<l rend="i0">If thou hast found the object of thy search,</l>
<l rend="i4">Thy hate, thy bloody aim,</l>
<l rend="i0">Into what deep damnation wilt thou plunge</l>
<l rend="i4">Thy miserable soul!</l>
<l rend="i0">Look! how his eye delighted watches thine!</l>
<l rend="i4">Look! how his open lips</l>
<l rend="i4">Gasp at the winning tale!</l>
<l rend="i4">And nearer now he comes</l>
<l rend="i0">To lose no word of that delightful talk.</l>
<l rend="i4">Then, as in familiar mood,</l>
<l rend="i4">Upon the Stripling's arm</l>
<l rend="i4">The Sorcerer laid his hand,</l>
<l rend="i2">And the fire of the Crystal fled.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Whilst the sudden shoot of joy</l>
<l rend="i4">Made pale Abdaldar's cheek,</l>
<l rend="i4">The Master's voice was heard:</l>
<l rend="i4">"It is the hour<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> of prayer,...</l>
<l rend="i0">"My children, let us purify ourselves</l>
<l rend="i4">"And praise the Lord our God!"</l>
<l rend="i4">The Boy the water brought,</l>
<l rend="i0">After the law<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> they purified themselves,</l>
<l rend="i0">And bent their faces to the earth in prayer.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">All, save Abdaldar; over Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i0">He stands, and lifts the dagger to destroy.</l>
<l rend="i2">Before his lifted arm received</l>
<l rend="i4">Its impulse to descend,</l>
<l rend="i4">The Blast of the Desert came.</l>
<l rend="i0">Prostrate in prayer, the pious family</l>
<l rend="i4">Felt not the Simoom<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> pass.</l>
<l rend="i0">They rose, and lo! the Sorcerer lying dead,</l>
<l rend="i0">Holding the dagger in his blasted hand.</l></lg>

</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Oneiza, look! the dead man has a ring,...</l>
<l rend="i0">Should it be buried with him?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">ONEIZA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i10">Oh yes ... yes!</l><l rend="i0">A wicked man! all that he has must needs</l>
<l rend="i0">Be wicked too!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i6">But see,... the sparkling stone!</l>
<l rend="i0">How it has caught the glory of the Sun,</l>
<l rend="i0">And streams it back again in lines of light!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">ONEIZA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Why do you take it from him Thalaba?...</l>
<l rend="i0">And look at it so near?... it may have charms</l>
<l rend="i0">To blind, or poison ... throw it in the grave!...</l>
<l rend="i0">I would not touch it!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>

<l rend="i0">Strange letters,...</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">ONEIZA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">Bury it.... Oh! bury it!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">It is not written as the Koran is;</l>
<l rend="i0">Some other tongue perchance ... the accursed man</l>
<l rend="i0">Said he had been a traveller.</l>

<l rend="i8">MOATH.</l>

<l rend="i6"><hi rend="italic">coming from the tent.</hi></l>

<l rend="i10">Thalaba,</l><l rend="i0">What hast thou there?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">A ring the dead man wore,</l>
<l rend="i0">Perhaps my father, you can read its meaning.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">MOATH.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">No Boy,... the letters are not such as ours.</l>
<l rend="i0">Heap the sand over it! a wicked man</l>
<l rend="i0">Wears nothing holy.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">Nay! not bury it!</l>
<l rend="i0">It may be that some traveller who shall enter</l>
<l rend="i0">Our tent, may read them: or if we approach</l>
<l rend="i0">Cities where strangers dwell and learned men,</l>
<l rend="i0">They may interpret.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">MOATH.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">It were better hid</l>
<l rend="i0">Under the desert sands. This wretched man,</l>
<l rend="i0">Whom God hath smitten in the very purpose</l>
<l rend="i0">And impulse of his unpermitted crime,</l>
<l rend="i0">Belike was some Magician, and these lines</l>
<l rend="i0">Are of the language that the Demons use.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">ONEIZA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Bury it! bury it ... dear Thalaba!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">MOATH.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Such cursed men there are upon the earth,</l>
<l rend="i0">In league and treaty with the Evil powers,</l>
<l rend="i0">The covenanted enemies of God</l>
<l rend="i0">And of all good, dear purchase have they made</l>
<l rend="i0">Of rule, and riches, and their life-long sway,</l>
<l rend="i0">Masters, yet slaves of Hell. Beneath the Roots</l>
<l rend="i0">Of Ocean, the Domdaniel caverns lie:</l>
<l rend="i0">Their impious meeting; there they learn the words</l>
<l rend="i0">Unutterable by man who holds his hope</l>
<l rend="i0">Of Heaven, there brood the Pestilence, and let</l>
<l rend="i0">The Earthquake loose.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i6">  And he who would have killed me</l>
<l rend="i0">Was one of these?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">MOATH.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i6">I know not, but it may be</l>
<l rend="i0">That on the Table of Destiny, thy name</l>
<l rend="i0">Is written their Destroyer, and for this</l>
<l rend="i0">Thy life by yonder miserable man</l>
<l rend="i0">So sought; so saved by interfering Heaven.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">His ring has some strange power then?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">MOATH.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i13">Every gem,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></l><l rend="i0">So sages say, has virtue; but the science</l>
<l rend="i0">Of difficult attainment, some grow pale</l>
<l rend="i0">Conscious of poison,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> or with sudden shade</l>
<l rend="i0">Of darkness, warn the wearer; same preserve</l>
<l rend="i0">From spells, or blunt the hostile weapon's<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> edge.</l>
<l rend="i0">Some open rocks and mountains, and lay bare</l>
<l rend="i0">Their buried treasures; others make the sight</l>
<l rend="i0">Strong to perceive the presence of all Beings</l>
<l rend="i0">Thro' whose pure substance the unaided eye</l>
<l rend="i0">Passes, like empty air ... and in yon stone</l>
<l rend="i0">I deem some such misterious quality.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">My father, I will wear it.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">MOATH.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i10">Thalaba!</l></lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">In God's name, and the Prophet's! be its power</l>
<l rend="i0">Good, let it serve the righteous: if for evil,</l>
<l rend="i0">God and my trust in him shall hallow it.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">So Thalaba drew on</l>
<l rend="i4">The written ring of gold.</l>
<l rend="i4">Then in the hollow grave</l>
<l rend="i4">They laid Abdaldar's corpse,</l>
<l rend="i0">And levelled over him the desert dust.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">The Sun arose, ascending from beneath</l>
<l rend="i4">The horizon's circling line.</l>
<l rend="i0">As Thalaba to his ablutions went,</l>
<l rend="i0">Lo! the grave open, and the corpse exposed!</l>
<l rend="i2">It was not that the winds of night</l>
<l rend="i0">Had swept away the sands that covered it,</l>
<l rend="i2">For heavy with the undried dew</l>
<l rend="i0">The desert dust was dark and close around;</l>
<l rend="i0">And the night air had been so moveless calm,</l>
<l rend="i4">It had not from the grove</l>
<l rend="i4">Shaken a ripe date down.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Amazed to hear the tale</l>
<l rend="i0">Forth from the tent came Moath and his child.</l>
<l rend="i0">Awhile the thoughtful man surveyed the corpse</l>
<l rend="i4">Silent with downward eyes,</l>
<l rend="i0">Then turning spake to Thalaba and said,</l>
<l rend="i0">"I have heard that there are places by the abode</l>
<l rend="i0">"Of holy men, so holily possessed,</l>
<l rend="i0">"That if a corpse be buried there, the ground</l>
<l rend="i0">"With a convulsive effort shakes it out,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></l>
<l rend="i0">"Impatient of pollution. Have the feet</l>
<l rend="i0">"Of Prophet or Apostle blest this place?</l>
<l rend="i0">"Ishmael, or Houd, or Saleh, or than all,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Mohammed, holier name? or is the man</l>
<l rend="i0">"So foul with magic and all blasphemy,</l>
<l rend="i0">"That Earth<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> like Heaven rejects him? it is best</l>
<l rend="i0">"Forsake the station. Let us strike our tent.</l>
<l rend="i2">"The place is tainted ... and behold</l>
<l rend="i0">"The Vulture<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> hovers yonder, and his scream</l>
<l rend="i0">"Chides us that we still we scare him from his banquet.</l>
<l rend="i4">"So let the accursed one</l>
<l rend="i4">"Find fitting sepulchre."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Then from the pollution of death</l>
<l rend="i2">With water they made themselves pure,</l>
<l rend="i4">And Thalaba drew up</l>
<l rend="i4">The fastening of the cords,</l>
<l rend="i4">And Moath furled the tent,</l>
<l rend="i0">And from the grove of palms Oneiza led</l>
<l rend="i0">The Camels, ready to receive their load.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The dews had ceased to steam</l>
<l rend="i4">Towards the climbing Sun,</l>
<l rend="i0">When from the Isle of Palms they went their way.</l>
<l rend="i0">And when the Sun had reached his southern height,</l>
<l rend="i4">As back they turned their eyes,</l>
<l rend="i4">The distant Palms arose</l>
<l rend="i0">Like to the top-sails of some far-off fleet</l>
<l rend="i4">Distinctly seen, where else</l>
<l rend="i0">The Ocean bounds had blended with the sky.</l>
<l rend="i4">And when the eve came on</l>
<l rend="i0">The sight returning reached the grove no more.</l>
<l rend="i2">They planted the pole of their tent,</l>
<l rend="i2">And they laid them down to repose.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">At midnight Thalaba started up,</l>
<l rend="i0">For he felt that the ring on his finger was moved.</l>
<l rend="i4">He called on Allah aloud,</l>
<l rend="i4">And he called on the Prophet's name.</l>
<l rend="i4">Moath arose in alarm,</l>
<l rend="i4">"What ails thee Thalaba?" he cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Is the Robber of night at hand?"</l>
<l rend="i4">"Dost thou not see," the youth exclaimed,</l>
<l rend="i4">"A Spirit in the Tent?"</l>
<l rend="i4">Moath looked round and said,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The moon beam shines in the Tent,</l>
<l rend="i4">"I see thee stand in the light,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And thy shadow is black on the ground."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Thalaba answered not.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Spirit!" he cried, "what brings thee here?</l>
<l rend="i4">"In the name of the Prophet, speak,</l>
<l rend="i4">"In the name of Allah, obey!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">He ceased, and there was silence in the Tent.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Dost thou not hear?" quoth Thalaba.</l>
<l rend="i4">The listening man replied,</l>
<l rend="i4">"I hear the wind, that flaps</l>
<l rend="i4">"The curtain of the Tent.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"The Ring! the Ring!" the youth exclaimed.</l>
<l rend="i2">"For that the Spirit of Evil comes,</l>
<l rend="i2">"By that I see, by that I hear.</l>
<l rend="i2">"In the name of God, I ask thee</l>
<l rend="i2">"Who was he that slew my Father?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">DEMON.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Master of the powerful Ring!</l>
<l rend="i0">Okba, the wise Magician, did the deed.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Where does the Murderer dwell?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">DEMON.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">In the Domdaniel caverns</l>
<l rend="i4">Under the Roots of the Ocean.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Why were my Father and my brethren slain?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">DEMON.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">We knew from the race of Hodeirah</l>
<l rend="i2">The destined destroyer would come.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Bring me my father's sword.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">DEMON.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">A fire surrounds the fated-sword,</l>
<l rend="i2">No Spirit or Magician's hand</l>
<l rend="i2">Can pierce that guardian flame.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Bring me his bow and his arrows.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Distinctly Moath heard his voice, and She</l>
<l rend="i0">Who thro' the Veil of Separation, watched</l>
<l rend="i0">All sounds in listening terror, whose suspense</l>
<l rend="i4">Forbade the aid of prayer.</l>
<l rend="i2">They heard the voice of Thalaba;</l>
<l rend="i0">But when the Spirit spake, the motionless air</l>
<l rend="i4">Felt not the subtle sounds,</l>
<l rend="i4">Too fine for mortal sense.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">On a sudden the rattle of arrows was heard,</l>
<l rend="i0">And the quiver was laid at the feet of the youth,</l>
<l rend="i0">And in his hand they saw Hodeirah's Bow.</l>
<l rend="i2">He eyed the Bow, he twanged the string,</l>
<l rend="i0">And his heart bounded to the joyous tone.</l>
<l rend="i2">Anon he raised his voice, and cried</l>
<l rend="i4">"Go thy way, and never more,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Evil Spirit, haunt our tent!</l>
<l rend="i4">"By the virtue of the Ring,</l>
<l rend="i4">"By Mohammed's holier might,</l>
<l rend="i4">"By the holiest name of God,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Thee and all the Powers of Hell</l>
<l rend="i4">"I adjure and I command</l>
<l rend="i4">"Never more to trouble us!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Nor ever from that hour</l>
<l rend="i0">Did rebel Spirit on the Tent intrude,</l>
<l rend="i4">Such virtue had the Spell.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">And peacefully the vernal years</l>
<l rend="i4">Of Thalaba past on.</l>
<l rend="i0">Till now without an effort he could bend</l>
<l rend="i4">Hodeirah's stubborn Bow.</l>
<l rend="i4">Black were his eyes and bright,</l>
<l rend="i4">The sunny hue of health</l>
<l rend="i4">Glowed on his tawny cheek,</l>
<l rend="i0">His lip was darkened by maturing life;</l>
<l rend="i0">Strong were his shapely limbs, his stature tall;</l>
<l rend="i4">He was a comely youth.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Compassion for the child</l>
<l rend="i0">Had first old Moath's kindly heart possessed,</l>
<l rend="i0">An orphan, wailing in the wilderness.</l>
<l rend="i0">But when he heard his tale, his wonderous tale,</l>
<l rend="i0">Told by the Boy with such eye-speaking truth,</l>
<l rend="i2">Now with sudden bursts of anger,</l>
<l rend="i2">Now in the agony of tears,</l>
<l rend="i0">And now in flashes of prophetic joy.</l>
<l rend="i0">What had been pity became reverence,</l>
<l rend="i2">And like a sacred trust from Heaven</l>
<l rend="i4">The old man cherished him.</l>
<l rend="i4">Now with a father's love,</l>
<l rend="i2">Child of his choice, he loved the Boy,</l>
<l rend="i0">And like a father to the Boy was dear.</l>
<l rend="i0">Oneiza called him brother, and the youth,</l>
<l rend="i0">More fondly than a brother, loved the maid,</l>
<l rend="i0">The loveliest of Arabian maidens she.</l>
<l rend="i4">How happily the years</l>
<l rend="i4">Of Thalaba went by!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">It was the wisdom and the will of Heaven</l>
<l rend="i2">That in a lonely tent had cast</l>
<l rend="i4">The lot of Thalaba.</l>
<l rend="i2">There might his soul develope best</l>
<l rend="i4">Its strengthening energies;</l>
<l rend="i4">There might he from the world</l>
<l rend="i0">Keep his heart pure and uncontaminate,</l>
<l rend="i0">Till at the written hour he should be found</l>
<l rend="i0">Fit servant of the Lord, without a spot.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Years of his youth, how rapidly ye fled</l>
<l rend="i2">In that beloved solitude!</l>
<l rend="i0">Is the morn fair, and does the freshening breeze</l>
<l rend="i2">Flow with cool current o'er his cheek?</l>
<l rend="i0">Lo! underneath the broad-leaved sycamore</l>
<l rend="i4">With lids half closed he lies,</l>
<l rend="i4">Dreaming of days to come.</l>
<l rend="i0">His dog<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> beside him, in mute blandishment,</l>
<l rend="i4">Now licks his listless hand,</l>
<l rend="i0">Now lifts an anxious and expectant eye</l>
<l rend="i4">Courting the wonted caress.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Or comes the Father<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> of the Rains</l>
<l rend="i2">From his Caves in the uttermost West,</l>
<l rend="i4">Comes he in darkness and storms?</l>
<l rend="i6">When the blast is loud,</l>
<l rend="i6">When the waters fill</l>
<l rend="i4">The Travellers tread in the sands,</l>
<l rend="i6">When the pouring shower</l>
<l rend="i6">Streams adown the roof,</l>
<l rend="i0">When the door-curtain hangs in heavier folds,</l>
<l rend="i2">When the outstrained tent flags loosely,</l>
<l rend="i6">Comfort is within,</l>
<l rend="i4">The embers chearful glow,</l>
<l rend="i2">The sound of the familiar voice,</l>
<l rend="i4">The song that lightens toil.</l>
<l rend="i0">Under the common shelter on dry sand</l>
<l rend="i0">The quiet Camels ruminate their food;</l>
<l rend="i2">From Moath falls the lengthening cord,</l>
<l rend="i4">As patiently the old Man</l>
<l rend="i0">Intwines the strong palm-fibers;<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> by the hearth</l>
<l rend="i2">The Damsel shakes the coffee-grains,</l>
<l rend="i2">That with warm fragrance fill the tent;</l>
<l rend="i0">And while with dextrous fingers, Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i0">Shapes the green basket,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> haply at his feet</l>
<l rend="i2">Her favourite kidling gnaws the twig,</l>
<l rend="i0">Forgiven plunderer, for Oneiza's sake!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Or when the winter torrent rolls</l>
<l rend="i0">Down the deep-channelled rain-course, foamingly,</l>
<l rend="i4">Dark with its mountain spoils,</l>
<l rend="i2">With bare feet pressing the wet sand</l>
<l rend="i4">There wanders Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i2">The rushing flow, the flowing roar,</l>
<l rend="i2">Filling his yielded faculties;</l>
<l rend="i0">A vague, a dizzy, a tumultuous joy.</l>
<l rend="i1">... Or lingers it a vernal brook<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></l>
<l rend="i4">Gleaming o'er yellow sands?</l>
<l rend="i2">Beneath the lofty bank reclined,</l>
<l rend="i0">With idle eye he views its little waves,</l>
<l rend="i0">Quietly listening to the quiet flow;</l>
<l rend="i0">While in the breathings of the stirring gale</l>
<l rend="i4">The tall canes bend above,</l>
<l rend="i2">Floating like streamers on the wind</l>
<l rend="i4">Their lank uplifted leaves.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Nor rich,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> nor poor, was Moath; God had given</l>
<l rend="i0">Enough, and blest him with a mind content.</l>
<l rend="i0">No hoarded<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> gold disquieted his dreams;</l>
<l rend="i0">But ever round his station he beheld</l>
<l rend="i4">Camels that knew his voice,</l>
<l rend="i0">And home-birds, grouping at Oneiza's call,</l>
<l rend="i4">And goats that, morn and eve,</l>
<l rend="i0">Came with full udders to the Damsel's hand.</l>
<l rend="i0">Dear child! the Tent beneath whose shade they dwelt</l>
<l rend="i2">That was her work; and she had twined</l>
<l rend="i4">His girdle's many-hues;</l>
<l rend="i4">And he had seen his robe</l>
<l rend="i4">Grow in Oneiza's loom.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></l>
<l rend="i0">How often with a memory-mingled joy</l>
<l rend="i0">That made her Mother live before his sight,</l>
<l rend="i0">He watched her nimble finders thread the woof!</l>
<l rend="i0">Or at the hand-mill<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> when she knelt and toiled,</l>
<l rend="i2">Tost the thin cake on spreading palm,</l>
<l rend="i0">Or fixed it on the glowing oven's side</l>
<l rend="i0">With bare<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> wet arm, in safe dexterity.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">'Tis the cool evening hour:</l>
<l rend="i4">The Tamarind from the dew</l>
<l rend="i4">Sheaths<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> its young fruit, yet green.</l>
<l rend="i2">Before their Tent the mat is spread,</l>
<l rend="i4">The old man's aweful voice</l>
<l rend="i4">Intones<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> the holy Book.</l>
<l rend="i0">What if beneath no lamp-illumined dome,</l>
<l rend="i0">Its marble walls<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> bedecked with flourished truth,</l>
<l rend="i0">Azure and gold adornment? sinks the Word</l>
<l rend="i0">With deeper influence from the Imam's voice,</l>
<l rend="i0">Where in the day of congregation, crowds</l>
<l rend="i4">Perform the duty task?</l>
<l rend="i4">Their Father is their Priest,</l>
<l rend="i2">The Stars of Heaven their point<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> of prayer,</l>
<l rend="i4">And the blue Firmament</l>
<l rend="i2">The glorious Temple, where they feel</l>
<l rend="i4">The present Deity.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Yet thro' the purple glow of eve</l>
<l rend="i4">Shines dimly the white moon.</l>
<l rend="i0">The slackened bow, the quiver, the long lance,</l>
<l rend="i2">Rest on the pillar<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> of the Tent.</l>
<l rend="i0">Knitting light palm-leaves<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> for her brother's brow</l>
<l rend="i4">The dark-eyed damsel sits;</l>
<l rend="i4">The Old Man tranquilly</l>
<l rend="i4">Up his curled pipe inhales</l>
<l rend="i4">The tranquillizing herb.</l>
<l rend="i0">So listen they the reed<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> of Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i2">While his skilled fingers modulate</l>
<l rend="i0">The low, sweet, soothing, melancholy tones,</l>
<l rend="i0">Or if he strung the pearls<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> of Poetry</l>
<l rend="i2">Singing with agitated face</l>
<l rend="i0">And eloquent arms, and sobs that reach the heart,</l>
<l rend="i4">A tale<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> of love and woe;</l>
<l rend="i0">Then, if the brightening Moon that lit his face</l>
<l rend="i4">In darkness favoured her's,</l>
<l rend="i0">Oh! even with such a look, as, fables say,</l>
<l rend="i0">The mother Ostrich<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> fixes on her egg,</l>
<l rend="i4">Till that intense affection</l>
<l rend="i4">Kindle its light of life,</l>
<l rend="i0">Even in such deep and breathless tenderness</l>
<l rend="i0">Oneiza's soul is centered on the youth,</l>
<l rend="i0">So motionless with such an ardent gaze,</l>
<l rend="i4">Save when from her full eyes</l>
<l rend="i0">Quickly she wipes away the gushing tears</l>
<l rend="i4">That dim his image there.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">She called him brother: was it sister-love</l>
<l rend="i4">That made the silver rings</l>
<l rend="i0">Round her smooth ankles<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and her twany arms,</l>
<l rend="i0">Shine daily brightened? for a brother's eye</l>
<l rend="i4">Were her long fingers<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> tinged,</l>
<l rend="i4">As when she trimmed the lamp,</l>
<l rend="i2">And thro' the veins and delicate skin</l>
<l rend="i0">The light shone rosy? that the darkened lids<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></l>
<l rend="i0">Gave yet a softer lustre to her eye?</l>
<l rend="i4">That with such pride she tricked</l>
<l rend="i0">Her glossy tresses, and on holy day</l>
<l rend="i0">Wreathed the red flower-crown<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> round their jetty waves?</l>
<l rend="i4">How happily the years</l>
<l rend="i4">Of Thalaba went by!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Yet was the heart of Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i4">Impatient of repose;</l>
<l rend="i4">Restless he pondered still</l>
<l rend="i4">The task for him decreed,</l>
<l rend="i0">The mighty and mysterious work announced.</l>
<l rend="i2">Day by day with youthful ardour</l>
<l rend="i2">He the call of Heaven awaits,</l>
<l rend="i0">And oft in visions o'er the Murderer's head</l>
<l rend="i4">He lifts the avenging arm,</l>
<l rend="i4">And oft in dreams he sees</l>
<l rend="i2">The Sword that is circled with fire.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">One morn as was their wont, in sportive mood</l>
<l rend="i0">The youth and damsel bent Hodeirah's bow,</l>
<l rend="i0">For with no feeble hand nor erring aim</l>
<l rend="i0">Oneiza could let loose the obedient shaft.</l>
<l rend="i2">With head back-bending, Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i0">Shot up the aimless arrow high in air,</l>
<l rend="i0">Whose line in vain the aching sight pursued</l>
<l rend="i4">Lost in the depth of heaven.</l>
<l rend="i0">"When will the hour arrive," exclaimed the youth,</l>
<l rend="i2">"That I shall aim these fated shafts</l>
<l rend="i4">"To vengeance long delayed?</l>
<l rend="i0">"Have I not strength, my father, for the deed?</l>
<l rend="i2">"Or can the will of Providence</l>
<l rend="i4">"Be mutable like man?</l>
<l rend="i2">"Shall I never be called to the task?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Impatient boy!" quoth Moath, with a smile:</l>
<l rend="i0">"Impatient Thalaba!" Oneiza cried,</l>
<l rend="i2">And she too smiled, but in her smile</l>
<l rend="i0">A mild reproachful melancholy mixed.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Then Moath pointed where a cloud</l>
<l rend="i0">Of Locusts, from the desolated fields</l>
<l rend="i4">Of Syria, winged their way.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Lo! how created things</l>
<l rend="i4">"Obey the written doom!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Onward they came, a dark continuous cloud</l>
<l rend="i0">Of congregated myriads numberless,</l>
<l rend="i0">The rushing of whose wings was as the sound</l>
<l rend="i0">Of a broad river, headlong in its course</l>
<l rend="i0">Plunged from a mountain summit, or the roar</l>
<l rend="i0">Of a wild ocean in the autumn storm,</l>
<l rend="i0">Shattering its billows on a shore of rocks.</l>
<l rend="i0">Onward they came, the winds impelled them on,</l>
<l rend="i0">Their work was done, their path of<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> ruin past,</l>
<l rend="i0">Their graves were ready in the wilderness.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Behold the mighty army!" Moath cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Blindly they move, impelled</l>
<l rend="i4">"By the blind Element.</l>
<l rend="i0">"And yonder Birds our welcome visitants,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Lo! where they soar above the embodied host,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Pursue their way, and hang upon their rear,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And thin their spreading flanks,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Rejoicing o'er their banquet! deemest thou</l>
<l rend="i0">"The scent of water, on the Syrian mosque</l>
<l rend="i0">"Placed with priest-mummery, and the jargon-rites</l>
<l rend="i0">"That fool the multitude, has led them here</l>
<l rend="i0">"From far Khorasan?<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Allah who decreed</l>
<l rend="i0">"Yon tribe the plague and punishment of man,</l>
<l rend="i0">"These also hath he doomed to meet their way:</l>
<l rend="i4">"Both passive instruments</l>
<l rend="i4">"Of his all-acting will,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Sole mover he, and only spring of all."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">While thus he spake, Oneiza's eye looks up</l>
<l rend="i4">Where one towards her flew,</l>
<l rend="i0">Satiate, for so it seemed, with sport and food.</l>
<l rend="i4">The Bird flew over her,</l>
<l rend="i4">And as he past above,</l>
<l rend="i0">From his relaxing grasp a Locust fell....</l>
<l rend="i2">It fell upon the Maiden's robe,</l>
<l rend="i0">And feebly there it stood, recovering slow.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The admiring girl surveyed</l>
<l rend="i4">His out-spread sails of green.</l>
<l rend="i4">His gauzy underwings,</l>
<l rend="i0">One closely to the grass green body furled,</l>
<l rend="i0">One ruffled in the fall, and half unclosed.</l>
<l rend="i4">She viewed his jet-orbed eyes</l>
<l rend="i4">His glossy gorget bright</l>
<l rend="i4">Green-glittering in the sun;</l>
<l rend="i4">His plumy pliant horns</l>
<l rend="i4">That, nearer as she gazed,</l>
<l rend="i2">Bent tremblingly before her breath.</l>
<l rend="i2">She viewed his yellow-circled front</l>
<l rend="i4">With lines mysterious veined;</l>
<l rend="i2">"And knowest thou what is written here,</l>
<l rend="i4">"My father?" said the Maid.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Look Thalaba! perchance these lines</l>
<l rend="i2">"Are in the letters of the Ring,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Nature's own language written here."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">The youth bent down, and suddenly</l>
<l rend="i4">He started, and his heart</l>
<l rend="i4">Sprung, and his cheek grew red,</l>
<l rend="i0">For the mysterious<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> lines were legible,</l>
<l rend="i2"><hi rend="smallcap">When the sun shall be darkened at noon</hi>,</l>
<l rend="i4"><hi rend="smallcap">Son of Hodeirah, depart.</hi></l>
<l rend="i0">And Moath looked, and read the lines aloud;</l>
<l rend="i2">The Locust shook his wings and fled,</l>
<l rend="i4">And they were silent all.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Who then rejoiced but Thalaba?</l>
<l rend="i0">Who then was troubled but the Arabian Maid?</l>
<l rend="i4">And Moath sad of heart,</l>
<l rend="i0">Tho' with a grief supprest, beheld the youth</l>
<l rend="i4">Sharpen his arrows now,</l>
<l rend="i4">And now new-plume their shafts,</l>
<l rend="i2">Now to beguile impatient hope</l>
<l rend="i4">Feel every sharpened point.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Why is that anxious look," Oneiza cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Still upwards cast at noon?</l>
<l rend="i0">"Is Thalaba aweary of our tent?"</l>
<l rend="i2">"I would be gone," the youth replied,</l>
<l rend="i4">"That I might do my task,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And full of glory to the tent return</l>
<l rend="i4">"Whence I should part no more."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">But on the noontide sun,</l>
<l rend="i0">As anxious and as oft Oneiza's eye</l>
<l rend="i4">Was upward glanced in fear.</l>
<l rend="i0">And now as Thalaba replied, her cheek</l>
<l rend="i4">Lost its fresh and lively hue,</l>
<l rend="i4">For in the Sun's bright edge</l>
<l rend="i0">She saw, or thought she saw, a little speck.</l>
<l rend="i4">The sage Astronomer</l>
<l rend="i2">Who with the love of science full</l>
<l rend="i0">Trembled that day at every passing cloud,</l>
<l rend="i0">He had not seen it, 'twas a speck so small.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Alas! Oneiza sees the spot increase!</l>
<l rend="i4">And lo! the ready Youth</l>
<l rend="i0">Over his shoulder the full quiver slings</l>
<l rend="i4">And grasps the slackened bow.</l>
<l rend="i4">It spreads, and spreads, and now</l>
<l rend="i4">Has shaddowed half the Sun,</l>
<l rend="i4">Whose crescent-pointed horns</l>
<l rend="i4">Now momently decrease.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">The day grows dark, the Birds retire to rest;</l>
<l rend="i4">Forth from her shadowy haunt</l>
<l rend="i0">Flies the large-headed<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Screamer of the night.</l>
<l rend="i2">Far off the affrighted African,</l>
<l rend="i4">Deeming his God deceased,</l>
<l rend="i4">Falls on his knees in prayer,</l>
<l rend="i4">And trembles as he sees</l>
<l rend="i4">The fierce Hyena's eyes</l>
<l rend="i0">Glare in the darkness of that dreadful noon.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Then Thalaba exclaimed, "Farewell,</l>
<l rend="i0">"My father! my Oneiza!" the Old Man</l>
<l rend="i4">Felt his throat swell with grief.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Where wilt thou go my Child?" he cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Wilt thou not wait a sign</l>
<l rend="i4">"To point thy destined way?"</l>
<l rend="i0">"God will conduct me!" said the noble youth,</l>
<l rend="i4">He said and from the Tent</l>
<l rend="i0">In the depth of the darkness departed.</l>
<l rend="i4">They heard his parting steps,</l>
<l rend="i0">The quiver rattling as he past away.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="i4">Whose is yon dawning form,</l>
<l rend="i4">That in the darkness meets</l>
<l rend="i4">The delegated youth?</l>
<l rend="i0">Dim as the shadow of a fire at noon,</l>
<l rend="i0">Or pale reflection on the evening brook</l>
<l rend="i4">Of Glow-worm on the bank</l>
<l rend="i0">Kindled to guide her winged paramour.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">A moment, and the brightening image shaped</l>
<l rend="i0">His Mother's form and features. "Go," she cried,</l>
<l rend="i0">"To Babylon, and from the Angels learn</l>
<l rend="i2">"What talisman thy task requires."</l>
<l rend="i0">The Spirit hung towards him when she ceased,</l>
<l rend="i0">As tho' with actual lips she would have given</l>
<l rend="i2">A mother's kiss ... his arms outstretched,</l>
<l rend="i4">His body bending on,</l>
<l rend="i0">His lips unclosed and trembling into speech</l>
<l rend="i0">He prest to meet the blessing,... but the wind</l>
<l rend="i0">Played on his cheek: he looked, and he beheld</l>
<l rend="i0">The darkness close. "Again! again!" he cried,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Let me again behold thee!" from the darkness</l>
<l rend="i4">His Mother's voice went forth;</l>
<l rend="i0">"Thou shall behold me in the hour of death."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Day dawns, the twilight gleam dilates,</l>
<l rend="i2">The Sun comes forth and like a God</l>
<l rend="i4">Rides thro' rejoicing heaven.</l>
<l rend="i0">Old Moath and his daughter from their tent</l>
<l rend="i4">Beheld the adventurous youth,</l>
<l rend="i4">Dark moving o'er the sands,</l>
<l rend="i0">A lessening image, trembling thro' their tears.</l>
<l rend="i4">Visions of high emprize</l>
<l rend="i4">Beguiled his lonely road;</l>
<l rend="i2">And if sometimes to Moath's tent</l>
<l rend="i2">The involuntary mind recurred,</l>
<l rend="i0">Fancy, impatient of all painful thoughts</l>
<l rend="i0">Pictured the bliss should welcome his return.</l>
<l rend="i4">In dreams like these he went,</l>
<l rend="i4">And still of every dream</l>
<l rend="i4">Oneiza formed a part,</l>
<l rend="i0">And Hope and Memory made a mingled joy.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">In the eve he arrived at a Well,</l>
<l rend="i2">The Acacia bent over its side,</l>
<l rend="i2">Under whose long light-hanging boughs</l>
<l rend="i4">He chose his night's abode.</l>
<l rend="i0">There, due ablutions made and prayers performed,</l>
<l rend="i4">The youth his mantle spread,</l>
<l rend="i4">And silently produced</l>
<l rend="i4">His solitary meal.</l>
<l rend="i0">The silence and the solitude recalled</l>
<l rend="i0">Dear recollections, and with folded arms,</l>
<l rend="i0">Thinking of other days, he sate, till thought</l>
<l rend="i0">Had left him, and the Acacia's moving shade</l>
<l rend="i4">Upon the sunny sand</l>
<l rend="i4">Had caught his idle eye,</l>
<l rend="i4">And his awakened ear</l>
<l rend="i4">Heard the grey Lizard's chirp,</l>
<l rend="i4">The only sound of life.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">As thus in vacant quietness he sate,</l>
<l rend="i0">A Traveller on a Camel reached the Well,</l>
<l rend="i4">And courteous greeting gave.</l>
<l rend="i2">The mutual salutation past,</l>
<l rend="i0">He by the cistern too his garment spread,</l>
<l rend="i0">And friendly converse cheered the social meal.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">The Stranger was an antient man,</l>
<l rend="i4">Yet one whose green old age</l>
<l rend="i0">Bore the fair characters of temperate youth.</l>
<l rend="i0">So much of manhood's strength his limbs retained,</l>
<l rend="i0">It seemed he needed not the staff he bore.</l>
<l rend="i2">His beard was long, and grey, and crisp;</l>
<l rend="i4">Lively his eyes and quick,</l>
<l rend="i4">And reaching over them</l>
<l rend="i4">The large broad eye-brow curled....</l>
<l rend="i0">His speech was copious, and his winning words</l>
<l rend="i0">Enriched with knowledge, that the attentive youth</l>
<l rend="i2">Sate listening with a thirsty joy.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">So in the course of talk</l>
<l rend="i4">The adventurer youth enquired</l>
<l rend="i4">Whither his course was bent;</l>
<l rend="i0">The Old Man answered, "to Bagdad I go."</l>
<l rend="i0">At that so welcome sound a flash of joy</l>
<l rend="i2">Kindled the eye of Thalaba;</l>
<l rend="i4">"And I too," he replied,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Am journeying thitherward,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Let me become companion of thy way!"</l>
<l rend="i4">Courteous the Old Man smiled,</l>
<l rend="i4">And willing in assent....</l>

<l rend="i0">And as their garrulous ignorance relates</l>
<l rend="i0">We learn it and believe ... but all things feel</l>
<l rend="i0">The power of Time and Change! thistles and grass</l>
<l rend="i0">Usurp the desolate palace, and the weeds</l>
<l rend="i0">Of Falshood root in the aged pile of Truth.</l>
<l rend="i0">How have you heard the tale?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i12">Thus ... on a time</l><l rend="i0">The Angels at the wickedness of man</l>
<l rend="i0">Expressed indignant wonder: that in vain</l>
<l rend="i0">Tokens and signs were given, and Prophets sent,...</l>
<l rend="i0">Strange obstinacy this! a stubborness</l>
<l rend="i0">Of sin, they said, that should for ever bar</l>
<l rend="i0">The gates of mercy on them. Allah heard</l>
<l rend="i0">Their unforgiving pride, and bade that two</l>
<l rend="i0">Of these untempted Spirits should descend,</l>
<l rend="i0">Judges on earth. Haruth and Maruth went,</l>
<l rend="i0">The chosen Sentencers; they fairly heard</l>
<l rend="i0">The appeals of men to their tribunal brought,</l>
<l rend="i0">And rightfully decided. At the length</l>
<l rend="i0">A Woman came before them ... beautiful</l>
<l rend="i0">Zohara was, as yonder Evening star,</l>
<l rend="i0">In the mild lustre<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> of whose lovely light</l>
<l rend="i0">Even now her beauty shines. They gazed on her</l>
<l rend="i0">With fleshly eyes, they tempted her to sin.</l>
<l rend="i0">The wily woman listened, and required</l>
<l rend="i0">A previous price, the knowledge of the name<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></l>
<l rend="i0">Of God. She learnt the wonder-working name</l>
<l rend="i0">And gave it utterance, and its virtue bore her</l>
<l rend="i0">Up to the glorious Presence, and she told</l>
<l rend="i0">Before the aweful Judgement-Seat, her tale.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">OLD MAN.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">I know the rest, the accused Spirits were called:</l>
<l rend="i0">Unable of defence, and penitent,</l>
<l rend="i0">They owned their crime and heard the doom deserved.</l>
<l rend="i0">Then they besought the Lord that not for ever</l>
<l rend="i0">His wrath might be upon them; and implored</l>
<l rend="i0">That penal ages might at length restore them</l>
<l rend="i0">Clean from offence, since then by Babylon</l>
<l rend="i0">In the cavern of their punishment they dwell,</l>
<l rend="i0">Runs the conclusion so?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i10">So I am taught.</l></lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">OLD MAN.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">The common tale! and likely thou hast heard</l>
<l rend="i0">How that the bold and bad, with impious rites</l>
<l rend="i0">Intrude upon their penitence, and force,</l>
<l rend="i0">Albeit from loathing and reluctant lips,</l>
<l rend="i0">The sorcery-secret?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">Is it not the truth?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">OLD MAN.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Son, thou hast seen the Traveller in the sands</l>
<l rend="i0">Move in the dizzy light of the hot noon,</l>
<l rend="i0">Huge<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> as the giant race of elder times,</l>
<l rend="i0">And his Camel, than the monstrous Elephant,</l>
<l rend="i0">Seem of a vaster bulk.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i10">A frequent sight.</l></lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">OLD MAN.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">And hast thou never in the twilight, fancied</l>
<l rend="i0">Familiar object into some strange shape</l>
<l rend="i0">And form uncouth?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">Aye! many a time.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">OLD MAN.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i14">Even so</l><l rend="i0">Things viewed at distance thro' the mist of fear,</l>
<l rend="i0">In their distortion terrify and shock</l>
<l rend="i0">The abused sight.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i6">   But of these Angels fate</l>
<l rend="i0">Thus in the uncreated Book is written.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">OLD MAN.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Wisely from legendary fables, Heaven</l>
<l rend="i0">Inculcates wisdom.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i6">   How then is the truth?</l>
<l rend="i0">Is not the dungeon of their punishment</l>
<l rend="i0">By ruined Babylon?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">OLD MAN.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">By Babylon</l>
<l rend="i0">Haruth and Maruth may be found.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
<l rend="i12">   And there</l><l rend="i0">Magician learn their impious sorcery?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">OLD MAN.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Son what thou sayest is true, and it is false.</l>
<l rend="i0">But night approaches fast; I have travelled far</l>
<l rend="i0">And my old lids are heavy ... on our way</l>
<l rend="i0">We shall have hours for converse, let us now</l>
<l rend="i0">Turn to our due repose. Son, peace be with thee!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">So in his loosened cloak</l>
<l rend="i4">The Old Man wrapt<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> himself</l>
<l rend="i4">And laid his limbs at length:</l>
<l rend="i0">And Thalaba in silence laid him down.</l>
<l rend="i0">Awhile he lay and watched the lovely Moon,</l>
<l rend="i4">O'er whose broad orb the boughs</l>
<l rend="i4">A mazy fretting framed,</l>
<l rend="i2">Or with a pale transparent green</l>
<l rend="i4">Lighting the restless leaves,</l>
<l rend="i0">The thin Acacia leaves that played above.</l>
<l rend="i2">The murmuring wind, the moving leaves</l>
<l rend="i0">Lulled him to sleep with mingled lullabies.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Not so the dark Magician by his side,</l>
<l rend="i0">Lobaba, who from the Domdaniel caves</l>
<l rend="i4">Had sought the dreaded youth.</l>
<l rend="i0">Silent he lay, and simulating sleep,</l>
<l rend="i0">Till by the long and regular breath he knew</l>
<l rend="i4">The youth beside him slept.</l>
<l rend="i4">Carefully then he rose,</l>
<l rend="i0">And bending over him, surveyed him near</l>
<l rend="i4">And secretly he cursed</l>
<l rend="i4">The dead Abdaldar's ring,</l>
<l rend="i4">Armed by whose amulet</l>
<l rend="i4">He slept from danger safe.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Wrapped in his mantle Thalaba reposed,</l>
<l rend="i2">His loose right arm pillowing his head.</l>
<l rend="i4">The Moon was on the Ring,</l>
<l rend="i4">Whose crystal gem returned</l>
<l rend="i4">A quiet, moveless light.</l>
<l rend="i0">Vainly the Wizard vile put forth his hand</l>
<l rend="i4">And strove to reach the gem,</l>
<l rend="i0">Charms strong as hell could make them, made it safe.</l>
<l rend="i4">He called his servant fiends,</l>
<l rend="i0">He bade the Genii rob the sleeping youth.</l>
<l rend="i4">By the virtue of the Ring,</l>
<l rend="i4">By Mohammed's holier power,</l>
<l rend="i4">By the holiest name of God,</l>
<l rend="i0">Had Thalaba disarmed the evil race.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Baffled and weary, and convinced at length,</l>
<l rend="i0">Anger, and fear, and rancour gnawing him,</l>
<l rend="i0">The accursed Sorcerer ceased his vain attempts.</l>
<l rend="i4">Content perforce to wait</l>
<l rend="i4">Temptations likelier aid.</l>
<l rend="i0">Restless he lay, and brooding many a wile,</l>
<l rend="i2">And tortured with impatient hope,</l>
<l rend="i0">And envying with the bitterness of hate</l>
<l rend="i0">The innocent youth, who slept so sweetly by.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">The ray of morning on his eye lids fell,</l>
<l rend="i4">And Thalaba awoke</l>
<l rend="i2">And folded his mantle around him,</l>
<l rend="i2">And girded his loins for the day;</l>
<l rend="i0">Then the due rites of holiness observed.</l>
<l rend="i4">His comrade too arose,</l>
<l rend="i4">And with the outward forms</l>
<l rend="i0">Of righteousness and prayer insulted God.</l>
<l rend="i2">They filled their water skin, they gave</l>
<l rend="i4">The Camel his full draught.</l>
<l rend="i0">Then on their road while yet the morn was young</l>
<l rend="i4">And the air was fresh with dew,</l>
<l rend="i4">Forward the travellers went,</l>
<l rend="i0">With various talk beguiling the long way.</l>
<l rend="i2">But soon the youth, whose busy mind</l>
<l rend="i0">Dwelt on Lobaba's wonder-stirring words,</l>
<l rend="i0">Renewed the unfinished converse of the night.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Thou saidest that it is true, and yet is false,</l>
<l rend="i0">That men accurst, attain at Babylon</l>
<l rend="i0">Forbidden knowledge from the Angel pair....</l>
<l rend="i0">How mean you?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LOBABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i6">All things have a double power,</l>
<l rend="i0">Alike for good and evil, the same fire</l>
<l rend="i0">That on the comfortable hearth at eve</l>
<l rend="i0">Warmed the good man, flames o'er the house at night</l>
<l rend="i4">Should we for this forego</l>
<l rend="i4">The needful element?</l>
<l rend="i2">Because the scorching summer Sun</l>
<l rend="i0">Darts fever, wouldst thou quench the orb of day?</l>
<l rend="i0">Or deemest thou that Heaven in anger formed</l>
<l rend="i0">Iron to till the field, because when man</l>
<l rend="i0">Had tipt his arrows for the chase, he rushed</l>
<l rend="i0">A murderer to the war?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i10">What follows hence?</l></lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LOBABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">That nothing in itself is good or evil,</l>
<l rend="i0">But only in its use. Think you the man</l>
<l rend="i0">Praiseworthy who by painful study learns</l>
<l rend="i0">The knowledge of all simples, and their power</l>
<l rend="i0">Healing or harmful?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">All men hold in honour</l>
<l rend="i0">The skilful Leech. From land to land he goes</l>
<l rend="i0">Safe in his privilege; the sword of war</l>
<l rend="i0">Spares him, Kings welcome him with costly gifts,</l>
<l rend="i0">And he who late had from the couch of pain</l>
<l rend="i0">Lifted a languid look to him for aid,</l>
<l rend="i0">Views him with brightened eyes, and blesses him</l>
<l rend="i0">In his first thankful prayer.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LOBABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i10">Yet some there are</l><l rend="i0">Who to the purposes of wickedness,</l>
<l rend="i0">Apply this knowledge, and from herbs distil</l>
<l rend="i0">Poison to mix it in the trusted draught.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Allah shall cast them in the fire</l>
<l rend="i0">Whose fuel is the cursed! there shall they</l>
<l rend="i0">Endure the ever-burning agony</l>
<l rend="i0">Consuming<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> still in flames, and still renewed.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LOBABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">But is their knowledge therefore in itself</l>
<l rend="i0">Unlawful?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">That were foolishness to think.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LOBABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">O what a glorious animal were Man,</l>
<l rend="i0">Knew he but his own powers! and knowing gave them</l>
<l rend="i0">Room for their growth and spread! the Horse obeys</l>
<l rend="i0">His guiding will, the patient Camel bears him</l>
<l rend="i0">Over these wastes of sand, the Pigeon wafts</l>
<l rend="i0">His bidding thro' the sky: and with these triumphs</l>
<l rend="i0">He rests contented! with these ministers,</l>
<l rend="i0">When he might awe the Elements, and make</l>
<l rend="i0">Myriads of Spirits serve him!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i12">But as how!</l><l rend="i0">By a league with Hell, a covenant that binds</l>
<l rend="i0">The soul to utter death!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LOBABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i10">Was Solomon</l><l rend="i0">Accurst of God? yet to his talismans</l>
<l rend="i0">Obedient, o'er his throne the birds of Heaven</l>
<l rend="i0">Their waving wings<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> his sun-shield, fanned around him</l>
<l rend="i0">The motionless air of noon: from place to place,</l>
<l rend="i0">As his will reined the viewless Element</l>
<l rend="i0">He rode the Wind: the Genii reared his temple,</l>
<l rend="i0">And ceaselessly in fear while his dead eye</l>
<l rend="i0">O'erlooked them, day and night pursued their toil,</l>
<l rend="i0">So dreadful was his power.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i10">But 'twas from Heaven</l><l rend="i0">His wisdom came; God's special gift ... the guerdon</l>
<l rend="i0">Of early virtue.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LOBABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i6">Learn thou, O young man!</l>
<l rend="i0">God hath appointed Wisdom the reward</l>
<l rend="i0">Of study! 'tis a spring of living waters,</l>
<l rend="i0">Whose inexhaustible bounties all might drink</l>
<l rend="i0">But few dig deep enough. Son! thou art silent,...</l>
<l rend="i0">Perhaps I say too much,... perhaps offend thee.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Nay, I am young, and willingly as becomes me,</l>
<l rend="i0">Hear the wise words of age.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LOBABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i12">Is it a crime</l><l rend="i0">To mount the horse, because forsooth thy feet</l>
<l rend="i0">Can serve thee for the journey? is it sin</l>
<l rend="i0">Because the Hern soars upward in the sky</l>
<l rend="i0">Above the arrow's flight, to train the Falcon</l>
<l rend="i0">Whose beak shall pierce him there? the powers which All</l>
<l rend="i0">Granted to man, were granted for his use;</l>
<l rend="i0">All knowledge that befits not human weakness</l>
<l rend="i0">Is placed beyond its reach.... They who repair</l>
<l rend="i0">To Babylon, and from the Angels learn</l>
<l rend="i0">Mysterious wisdom, sin not in the deed.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Know you these secrets?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LOBABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i10">I? alas my Son</l><l rend="i0">My age just knows enough to understand</l>
<l rend="i0">How little all its knowledge! later years</l>
<l rend="i0">Sacred to study, teach me to regret</l>
<l rend="i0">Youth's unforeseeing indolence, and hours</l>
<l rend="i0">That cannot be recalled! something I know:</l>
<l rend="i0">The properties of herbs, and have sometimes</l>
<l rend="i0">Brought to the afflicted comfort and relief</l>
<l rend="i0">By the secrets of my art; under His blessing</l>
<l rend="i0">Without whom all had failed! Also of Gems</l>
<l rend="i0">I have some knowledge, and the characters</l>
<l rend="i0">That tell beneath what aspect they were set.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Belike you can interpret then the graving</l>
<l rend="i0">Around this Ring?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LOBABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">My sight is feeble, Son,</l>
<l rend="i0">And I must view it closer, let me try!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The unsuspecting Youth</l>
<l rend="i0">Held forth his linger to draw off the spell.</l>
<l rend="i4">Even whilst he held it forth,</l>
<l rend="i4">There settled there a Wasp,</l>
<l rend="i0">And just above the Gem infixed its dart.</l>
<l rend="i0">All purple swoln the hot and painful flesh</l>
<l rend="i4">Rose round the tightened Ring.</l>
<l rend="i0">The baffled Sorcerer knew the hand of Heaven,</l>
<l rend="i4">And inwardly blasphemed.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Ere long Lobaba's heart,</l>
<l rend="i0">Fruitful in wiles, devised new stratagem.</l>
<l rend="i4">A mist arose at noon;</l>
<l rend="i4">Like the loose hanging skirts</l>
<l rend="i0">Of some low cloud that, by the breeze impelled,</l>
<l rend="i4">Sweeps o'er the mountain side.</l>
<l rend="i4">With joy the thoughtless youth</l>
<l rend="i4">That grateful shadowing hailed;</l>
<l rend="i4">For grateful was the shade,</l>
<l rend="i2">While thro' the silver-lighted haze</l>
<l rend="i0">Guiding their way, appeared the beamless Sun.</l>
<l rend="i4">But soon that beacon failed;</l>
<l rend="i4">A heavier mass of cloud</l>
<l rend="i4">Impenetrably deep,</l>
<l rend="i4">Hung o'er the wilderness.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Knowest thou the track?" quoth Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Or should we pause, and wait the wind</l>
<l rend="i2">"To scatter this bewildering fog?"</l>
<l rend="i4">The Sorcerer answered him</l>
<l rend="i0">"Now let us hold right on,... for if we stray</l>
<l rend="i0">"The Sun tomorrow will direct our course."</l>
<l rend="i0">So saying, he towards the desert depths</l>
<l rend="i4">Misleads the youth deceived.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Earlier the night came on,</l>
<l rend="i0">Nor moon, nor stars, were visible in Heaven;</l>
<l rend="i0">And when at morn the youth unclosed his eyes</l>
<l rend="i0">He knew not where to turn his face in prayer.</l>
<l rend="i2">"What shall we do?" Lobaba cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The lights of Heaven have ceased</l>
<l rend="i4">"To guide us on our way.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Should we remain and wait</l>
<l rend="i4">"More favourable skies?</l>
<l rend="i0">"Soon would our food and water fail us here!</l>
<l rend="i4">"And if we venture on,</l>
<l rend="i0">"There are the dangers of the wilderness!"</l>
<l rend="i4">"Sure it were best proceed!"</l>
<l rend="i4">The chosen youth replies.</l>
<l rend="i0">"So haply we may reach some tent, or grove</l>
<l rend="i4">"Of dates, or stationed tribe.</l>
<l rend="i4">"But idly to remain</l>
<l rend="i0">"Were yielding effortless, and waiting death."</l>
<l rend="i0">The wily Sorcerer willingly assents,</l>
<l rend="i4">And farther in the sands,</l>
<l rend="i0">Elate of heart, he leads the credulous youth.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Still o'er the wilderness</l>
<l rend="i4">Settled the moveless mist.</l>
<l rend="i0">The timid Antelope that heard their steps</l>
<l rend="i0">Stood doubtful where to turn in that dim light,</l>
<l rend="i0">The Ostrich, blindly hastening, met them full.</l>
<l rend="i4">At night again in hope,</l>
<l rend="i4">Young Thalaba laid down;</l>
<l rend="i0">The morning came, and not one guiding ray</l>
<l rend="i2">Thro' the thick mist was visible,</l>
<l rend="i0">The same deep moveless mist that mantled all.</l>
<l rend="i4">Oh for the Vulture's scream</l>
<l rend="i0">That haunts for prey the abode of humankind!</l>
<l rend="i2">Oh for the Plover's<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> pleasant cry</l>
<l rend="i4">To tell of water near!</l>
<l rend="i2">Oh for the Camel-driver's<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> song!</l>
<l rend="i2">For now the water-skin grows light,</l>
<l rend="i0">Tho' of the draught, more eagerly desired,</l>
<l rend="i0">Imperious prudence took with sparing thirst.</l>
<l rend="i2">Oft from the third night's broken sleep,</l>
<l rend="i4">As in his dreams he heard</l>
<l rend="i4">The sound of rushing winds,</l>
<l rend="i0">Started the anxious youth, and looked abroad,</l>
<l rend="i0">In vain! for still the deadly calm endured.</l>
<l rend="i4">Another day past on,</l>
<l rend="i4">The water-skin was drained,</l>
<l rend="i4">But then one hope arrived</l>
<l rend="i2">For there was motion in the air!</l>
<l rend="i2">The sound of the wind arose anon</l>
<l rend="i4">That scattered the thick mist,</l>
<l rend="i0">And lo! at length the lovely face of Heaven!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Alas ... a wretched scene</l>
<l rend="i4">Was opened on their view.</l>
<l rend="i2">They looked around, no wells were near,</l>
<l rend="i4">No tent, no human aid!</l>
<l rend="i0">Flat on the Camel lay the water-skin,</l>
<l rend="i0">And their dumb servant difficultly now,</l>
<l rend="i0">Over hot sands and under the hot sun,</l>
<l rend="i4">Dragged on with patient pain.</l>
<l rend="i2">But oh the joy! the blessed sight!</l>
<l rend="i0">When in the burning waste the Travellers</l>
<l rend="i0">Saw a green meadow, fair with flowers besprent,</l>
<l rend="i0">Azure and yellow, like the beautiful fields</l>
<l rend="i0">Of England, when amid the growing grass</l>
<l rend="i0">The blue-bell bends, the golden king-cup shines,</l>
<l rend="i4">In the merry month of May!</l>
<l rend="i4">Oh joy! the Travellers</l>
<l rend="i0">Gaze on each other with hope-brightened eyes,</l>
<l rend="i2">For sure thro' that green meadow flows</l>
<l rend="i0">The living stream! and lo! their famished beast</l>
<l rend="i4">Sees the restoring sight!</l>
<l rend="i0">Hope gives his feeble limbs a sudden strength,</l>
<l rend="i0">He hurries on!</l>
<l rend="i6">The herbs so fair to eye</l>
<l rend="i0">Were Senna, and the Gentian's blossom blue,</l>
<l rend="i0">And kindred plants that with unwatered root</l>
<l rend="i0">Fed in the burning sand, whose bitter leaves</l>
<l rend="i4">Even frantic<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Famine loathed.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">In uncommunicating misery</l>
<l rend="i0">Silent they stood. At length Lobaba cried,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Son we must slay the Camel, or we die</l>
<l rend="i0">"For lack of water! thy young hand is firm,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Draw forth the knife and pierce him!"</l>
<l rend="i12">Wretch accurst,</l><l rend="i0">Who that beheld thy venerable face,</l>
<l rend="i0">Thy features fixed with suffering, the dry lips,</l>
<l rend="i0">The feverish eyes, could deem that all within</l>
<l rend="i0">Was magic ease, and fearlessness secure,</l>
<l rend="i0">And wiles of hellish import? the young man</l>
<l rend="i0">Paused with reluctant pity: but he saw</l>
<l rend="i0">His comrade's red and painful countenance,</l>
<l rend="i0">And his own burning breath came short and quick,</l>
<l rend="i2">And at his feet the gasping beast</l>
<l rend="i4">Lies, over-worn with want.</l>
<l rend="i0">Then from his<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> girdle Thalaba took the knife</l>
<l rend="i0">With stern compassion, and from side to side</l>
<l rend="i4">Across<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> the Camel's throat,</l>
<l rend="i4">Drew deep the crooked blade.</l>
<l rend="i2">Servant of man, that merciful deed</l>
<l rend="i0">For ever ends thy suffering, but what doom</l>
<l rend="i0">Waits thy deliverer! "little will thy death</l>
<l rend="i4">"Avail us!" thought the youth,</l>
<l rend="i2">As in the water-skin he poured</l>
<l rend="i4">The Camel's hoarded draught:</l>
<l rend="i4">It gave a scant supply,</l>
<l rend="i0">The poor allowance of one prudent day.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Son of Hodeirah, tho' thy steady soul</l>
<l rend="i4">Despaired not, firm in faith,</l>
<l rend="i0">Yet not the less did suffering Nature feel</l>
<l rend="i0">Her pangs and trials, long their craving thirst</l>
<l rend="i0">Struggled with fear, by fear itself inflamed;</l>
<l rend="i4">But drop by drop, that poor,</l>
<l rend="i4">That last supply is drained!</l>
<l rend="i0">Still the same burning sun! no cloud in heaven!</l>
<l rend="i0">The hot air quivers, and the sultry mist</l>
<l rend="i2">Floats o'er the desert, with a show</l>
<l rend="i0">Of distant<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> waters, mocking their distress!</l>
<l rend="i4">The youth's parched lips were black,</l>
<l rend="i4">His tongue was<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> dry and rough,</l>
<l rend="i4">His eye-balls red with heat.</l>
<l rend="i2">His comrade gazed on him with looks</l>
<l rend="i0">That seemed to speak of pity, and he said</l>
<l rend="i4">"Let me behold thy Ring,</l>
<l rend="i0">"It may have virtue that can save us yet!"</l>
<l rend="i4">With that he took his hand</l>
<l rend="i4">And viewed the writing close,</l>
<l rend="i4">Then cried with sudden joy</l>
<l rend="i2">"It is a stone that whoso bears</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Genii must obey!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Now raise thy voice, my Son,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And bid them in his name that here is written</l>
<l rend="i4">"Preserve us in our need."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"Nay!" answered Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Shall I distrust the providence of God?</l>
<l rend="i4">"Is it not He must save?</l>
<l rend="i4">"If Allah wills it not</l>
<l rend="i4">"Vain were the Genii's aid."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Whilst he spake Lobaba's eye</l>
<l rend="i4">Full on the distance fixed,</l>
<l rend="i4">Attended not his speech.</l>
<l rend="i4">Its fearful meaning drew</l>
<l rend="i4">The looks of Thalaba.</l>
<l rend="i2">Columns of sand came moving on,</l>
<l rend="i4">Red in the burning ray</l>
<l rend="i4">Like obelisks of fire</l>
<l rend="i2">They rushed before the driving wind.</l>
<l rend="i4">Vain were all thoughts of flight!</l>
<l rend="i4">They had not hoped escape</l>
<l rend="i0">Could they have backed the Dromedary then</l>
<l rend="i4">Who in his rapid race</l>
<l rend="i0">Gives to the tranquil<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> air, a drowning force.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">High ... high in heaven upcurled</l>
<l rend="i4">The dreadful<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> columns moved,</l>
<l rend="i0">Swift, as the whirlwind that impelled their way,</l>
<l rend="i2">They rushed towards the Travellers!</l>
<l rend="i4">The old Magician shrieked,</l>
<l rend="i4">And lo! the foremost bursts,</l>
<l rend="i4">Before the whirlwind's force,</l>
<l rend="i0">Scattering afar a burning shower of sand.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Now by the virtue of the Ring</l>
<l rend="i4">"Save us!" Lobaba cried.</l>
<l rend="i4">"While yet thou hast the power</l>
<l rend="i4">"Save us. O save us! now!"</l>
<l rend="i4">The youth made no reply,</l>
<l rend="i0">Gazing in aweful wonder on the scene.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"Why dost thou wait?" the Old Man exclaimed,</l>
<l rend="i0">"If Allah and the Prophet will not save</l>
<l rend="i4">"Call on the Powers that will!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Ha! do I know thee, Infidel accurst?"</l>
<l rend="i4">Exclaimed the awakened youth.</l>
<l rend="i0">"And thou hast led me hither, Child of Sin!</l>
<l rend="i4">"That fear might make me sell</l>
<l rend="i4">"My soul to endless death!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"Fool that thou art!" Lobaba cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Call upon him whose name</l>
<l rend="i4">"Thy charmed signet bears,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Or die the death thy foolishness deserves!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Servant of Hell! die thou!" quoth Thalaba.</l>
<l rend="i4">And leaning on his bow</l>
<l rend="i4">He fitted the loose string,</l>
<l rend="i0">And laid the arrow in its resting-place.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Bow of my Father, do thy duty now!"</l>
<l rend="i2">He drew the arrow to its point,</l>
<l rend="i4">True to his eye it fled,</l>
<l rend="i4">And full upon the breast</l>
<l rend="i4">It smote the wizard man.</l>
<l rend="i2">Astonished Thalaba beheld</l>
<l rend="i4">The blunted point recoil.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">A proud and bitter smile</l>
<l rend="i4">Wrinkled Lobaba's cheek,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Try once again thine earthly arms!" he cried.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Rash Boy! the Power I serve</l>
<l rend="i2">"Abandons not his votaries.</l>
<l rend="i0">"It is for Allah's wretched slaves, like thou,</l>
<l rend="i0">"To serve a master, who in the hour of need</l>
<l rend="i4">"Forsakes them to their fate!</l>
<l rend="i0">"I leave thee!"... and he shook his staff, and called</l>
<l rend="i4">The Chariot of his Charms.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Swift as the viewless wind,</l>
<l rend="i4">Self-moved, the Chariot came,</l>
<l rend="i4">The Sorcerer mounts the seat.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Yet once more weigh thy danger!" he exclaimed,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Ascend the car with me,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And with the speed of thought</l>
<l rend="i4">"We pass the desert bounds."</l>
<l rend="i0">The indignant youth vouchsafed not to reply,</l>
<l rend="i0">And lo! the magic car begins its course!</l>
<l rend="i2">Hark! hark!... he screams.... Lobaba screams!</l>
<l rend="i4">What wretch, and hast thou raised</l>
<l rend="i0">The rushing Terrors of the Wilderness</l>
<l rend="i4">To fall on thine own head?</l>
<l rend="i2">Death! death! inevitable death!</l>
<l rend="i4">Driven by the breath of God</l>
<l rend="i0">A column of the Desert met his way.</l></lg>

<l rend="i0">When Thalaba from adoration rose,</l>
<l rend="i4">The air was cool, the sky</l>
<l rend="i4">With welcome clouds o'ercast,</l>
<l rend="i4">That soon came down in rain.</l>
<l rend="i0">He lifted up his fevered face to heaven,</l>
<l rend="i2">And bared his head and stretched his hands</l>
<l rend="i4">To that delightful shower,</l>
<l rend="i0">And felt the coolness flow thro' every limb</l>
<l rend="i4">Freshening his powers of life.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">A loud quick panting! Thalaba looks up,</l>
<l rend="i2">He starts, and his instinctive hand</l>
<l rend="i2">Grasps the knife hilt: for close beside</l>
<l rend="i4">A Tyger passes him.</l>
<l rend="i2">An indolent and languid eye</l>
<l rend="i4">The passing Tyger turned;</l>
<l rend="i4">His head was hanging down,</l>
<l rend="i4">His dry tongue lolling low,</l>
<l rend="i0">And the short panting of his fevered breath</l>
<l rend="i0">Came thro' his hot parched nostrils painfully.</l>
<l rend="i4">The young Arabian knew</l>
<l rend="i2">The purport of his hurried pace,</l>
<l rend="i4">And following him in hope</l>
<l rend="i4">Saw joyful from afar</l>
<l rend="i4">The Tyger stoop and drink.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">The desert Pelican had built her nest</l>
<l rend="i4">In that deep solitude.</l>
<l rend="i2">And now returned from distant flight</l>
<l rend="i4">Fraught with the river stream,</l>
<l rend="i0">Her load of water had disburthened there.</l>
<l rend="i2">Her young in the refreshing bath</l>
<l rend="i4">Sported all wantonness;</l>
<l rend="i4">Dipt down their callow heads,</l>
<l rend="i0">Filled the swoln membrane from their plumeless throat</l>
<l rend="i4">Pendant, and bills yet soft,</l>
<l rend="i4">And buoyant with arched breast,</l>
<l rend="i4">Plied in unpractised stroke</l>
<l rend="i4">The oars of their broad feet.</l>
<l rend="i0">They, as the spotted prowler of the wild</l>
<l rend="i0">Laps the cool wave, around their mother croud,</l>
<l rend="i0">And nestle underneath her outspread wings.</l>
<l rend="i4">The spotted prowler of the wild</l>
<l rend="i0">Lapt the cool wave,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> and satiate from the nest,</l>
<l rend="i4">Guiltless of blood, withdrew.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">The mother bird had moved not</l>
<l rend="i2">But cowering o'er her nestlings,</l>
<l rend="i2">Sate confident and fearless,</l>
<l rend="i4">And watched the wonted guest.</l>
<l rend="i0">But when the human visitant approached,</l>
<l rend="i4">The alarmed Pelican</l>
<l rend="i2">Retiring from that hostile shape,</l>
<l rend="i0">Gathers her young, and menaces with wings,</l>
<l rend="i2">And forward thrusts her threatening neck,</l>
<l rend="i2">Its feathers ruffling in her wrath,</l>
<l rend="i4">Bold with maternal fear.</l>
<l rend="i0">Thalaba drank and in the water-skin</l>
<l rend="i2">Hoarded the precious element.</l>
<l rend="i0">Not all he took, but in the large nest left</l>
<l rend="i4">Store that sufficed for life.</l>
<l rend="i0">And journeying onward blest the Carrier Bird,</l>
<l rend="i4">And blest in thankfulness,</l>
<l rend="i0">Their common Father, provident for all.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">With strength renewed and confident in faith</l>
<l rend="i2">The son of Hodeirah proceeds;</l>
<l rend="i0">Till after the long toil of many a day,</l>
<l rend="i4">At length Bagdad appeared,</l>
<l rend="i4">The City of his search.</l>
<l rend="i4">He hastening to the gate</l>
<l rend="i0">Roams o'er the city with insatiate eyes,</l>
<l rend="i0">Its thousand dwellings o'er whose level roofs</l>
<l rend="i0">Fair cupolas appeared, and high-domed mosques</l>
<l rend="i0">And pointed minarets, and cypress groves</l>
<l rend="i0">Every where scattered<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> in unwithering green.</l>

<l rend="i0">Thou too art fallen, Bagdad! City of<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Peace,</l>
<l rend="i4">Thou too hast had thy day!</l>
<l rend="i0">And loathsome Ignorance and brute Servitude</l>
<l rend="i4">Pollute thy dwellings now,</l>
<l rend="i0">Erst for the Mighty and the Wise renowned.</l>
<l rend="i0">O yet illustrious for remembered fame,</l>
<l rend="i0">Thy founder the <a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>Victorious, and the pomp</l>
<l rend="i0">Of Haroun, for whose name by blood defiled,</l>
<l rend="i0">Jahia's, and the blameless Barmecides',</l>
<l rend="i0">Genius hath wrought salvation; and the years</l>
<l rend="i0">When Science with the good Al-Maimon dwelt;</l>
<l rend="i0">So one day may the Crescent from thy Mosques</l>
<l rend="i0">Be plucked by Wisdom, when the enlightened arm</l>
<l rend="i0">Of Europe conquers to redeem the East.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Then Pomp and Pleasure dwelt within her walls</l>
<l rend="i0">The Merchants of the East and of the West</l>
<l rend="i4">Met in her arched<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Bazars;</l>
<l rend="i4">All day the active poor</l>
<l rend="i0">Showered a cool comfort o'er her thronging streets;</l>
<l rend="i2">Labour was busy in her looms;</l>
<l rend="i4">Thro' all her open gates</l>
<l rend="i0">Long troops of laden Camels lined her roads,</l>
<l rend="i0">And Tigris on his tameless<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> current bore</l>
<l rend="i0">Armenian harvests to her multitudes.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">But not in sumptuous Caravansary</l>
<l rend="i4">The adventurer idles there,</l>
<l rend="i0">Nor satiates wonder with her pomp and wealth;</l>
<l rend="i2">A long day's distance from the walls</l>
<l rend="i4">Stands ruined Babylon!</l>
<l rend="i2">The time of action is at hand,</l>
<l rend="i2">The hope that for so many a year</l>
<l rend="i0">Hath been his daily thought, his nightly dream,</l>
<l rend="i4">Stings to more restlessness.</l>
<l rend="i0">He loathes all lingering that delays the hour</l>
<l rend="i0">When, full of glory, from his quest returned,</l>

<l rend="i4">The Bittern's<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Boom came far,</l>
<l rend="i4">Distinct in darkness seen</l>
<l rend="i0">Above the low horizon's lingering light</l>
<l rend="i0">Rose the near ruins of old Babylon.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Once from her lofty walls<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> the Charioteer</l>
<l rend="i0">Looked down on swarming myriads; once she flung</l>
<l rend="i0">Her arches o'er Euphrates conquered tide,</l>
<l rend="i0">And thro' her brazen portals when she poured</l>
<l rend="i0">Her armies forth, the distant nations looked</l>
<l rend="i0">As men who watched the thunder-cloud in fear</l>
<l rend="i0">Lest it should burst above them. She was fallen,</l>
<l rend="i0">The Queen of Cities, Babylon was fallen!</l>
<l rend="i0">Low lay her bulwarks; the black scorpion basked</l>
<l rend="i0">In the palace courts, within her sanctuary</l>
<l rend="i4">The She Wolf hid her whelps.</l>
<l rend="i0">Is yonder huge and shapeless heap, what once</l>
<l rend="i0">Had been the aerial<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Gardens, height on height</l>
<l rend="i0">Rising like Medias mountains crowned with wood,</l>
<l rend="i0">Work of imperial dotage? where the fame</l>
<l rend="i0">Of<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Belus? where the Golden Image now,</l>
<l rend="i0">Which at the sound of dulcimer and lute,</l>
<l rend="i0">Cornet and sackbut, harp and psaltery,</l>
<l rend="i4">The Assyrian slaves adored?</l>
<l rend="i0">A labyrinth of ruins, Babylon</l>
<l rend="i4">Spreads o'er the blasted plain:</l>
<l rend="i0">The wandering Arab never sets his tent</l>
<l rend="i0">Within her walls; the Shepherd<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> eyes afar</l>
<l rend="i0">Her evil Towers, and devious drives his flock.</l>
<l rend="i0">Alone unchanged, a free and bridgeless tide</l>
<l rend="i4">Euphrates rolls along,</l>
<l rend="i4">Eternal Nature's work.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Thro' the broken portal,</l>
<l rend="i4">Over weedy fragments,</l>
<l rend="i4">Thalaba went his way.</l>
<l rend="i4">Cautious he trod, and felt</l>
<l rend="i0">The dangerous ground before him with his bow.</l>
<l rend="i2">The Chacal started at his steps,</l>
<l rend="i2">The Stork, alarmed at sound of man,</l>
<l rend="i0">From her broad nest upon the old pillar top,</l>
<l rend="i2">Affrighted fled on flapping wings.</l>
<l rend="i2">The Adder in her haunts disturbed</l>
<l rend="i0">Lanced at the intruding staff her arrowy tongue.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Twilight and moonshine dimly mingling gave</l>
<l rend="i4">An aweful light obscure,</l>
<l rend="i4">Evening not wholly closed,</l>
<l rend="i4">The Moon still pale and faint.</l>
<l rend="i4">An aweful light obscure,</l>
<l rend="i0">Broken by many a mass of blackest shade;</l>
<l rend="i0">Long column stretching dark thro' weeds and moss,</l>
<l rend="i4">Broad length of lofty wall</l>
<l rend="i4">Whose windows lay in light,</l>
<l rend="i0">And of their former shape, low-arched or square,</l>
<l rend="i4">Rude outline on the earth</l>
<l rend="i4">Figured, with long grass fringed.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Reclined against a column's broken shaft,</l>
<l rend="i0">Unknowing whitherward to bend his way</l>
<l rend="i4">He stood and gazed around.</l>
<l rend="i4">The Ruins closed him in,</l>
<l rend="i2">It seemed as if no foot of man</l>
<l rend="i2">For ages had intruded there.</l>
<l rend="i4">Soon at approaching step</l>
<l rend="i4">Starting, he turned and saw</l>
<l rend="i0">A warrior in the moon beam drawing near.</l>
<l rend="i4">Forward the Stranger came</l>
<l rend="i4">And with a curious eye</l>
<l rend="i4">Perused the Arab youth.</l>
<l rend="i4">"And who art thou," he cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"That at an hour like this</l>
<l rend="i4">"Wanderest in Babylon?</l>
<l rend="i0">"A way-bewildered traveller, seekest thou</l>
<l rend="i4">"The ruinous shelter here?</l>
<l rend="i4">"Or comest thou to hide</l>
<l rend="i4">"The plunder of the night?</l>
<l rend="i4">"Or hast thou spells to make</l>
<l rend="i0">"These ruins, yawning from their rooted base</l>
<l rend="i4">"Disclose their secret<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> wealth?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">The youth replied, "nor wandering traveller</l>
<l rend="i4">"Nor robber of the night</l>
<l rend="i4">"Nor skilled in spells am I.</l>
<l rend="i4">"I seek the Angels here,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Haruth and Maruth. Stranger in thy turn,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Why wanderest thou in Babylon,</l>
<l rend="i2">"And who art thou, the Questioner?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">The man was fearless, and the tempered pride</l>
<l rend="i2">That toned the voice of Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i0">Displeased not him, himself of haughty heart.</l>
<l rend="i2">Heedless he answered, "knowest thou</l>
<l rend="i4">"Their cave of punishment?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Vainly I seek it.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">STRANGER.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i6">Art thou firm of foot</l>
<l rend="i0">To tread the ways of danger?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i12">Point the path!</l></lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">STRANGER.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Young Arab! if thou hast a heart can beat</l>
<l rend="i0">Evenly in danger, if thy bowels yearn not</l>
<l rend="i0">With human fears, at scenes where undisgraced</l>
<l rend="i0">The soldier tried in battle might look back</l>
<l rend="i0">And tremble, follow me!... for I am bound</l>
<l rend="i0">Into that cave of horrors.</l>
<l rend="i10">Thalaba</l><l rend="i0">Gazed on his comrade, he was young, of port</l>
<l rend="i0">Stately and strong; belike his face had pleased</l>
<l rend="i0">A woman's eye, yet the youth read in it</l>
<l rend="i0">Unrestrained passions, the obdurate soul</l>
<l rend="i0">Bold in all evil daring; and it taught,</l>
<l rend="i0">By Nature's irresistible instinct, doubt</l>
<l rend="i0">Well timed and wary. Of himself assured,</l>
<l rend="i0">Fearless of man, and confident in faith,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Lead on!" cried Thalaba.</l>
<l rend="i4">Mohareb led the way;</l>
<l rend="i4">And thro' the ruined streets,</l>
<l rend="i4">And thro' the farther gate</l>
<l rend="i4">They past in silence on.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">What sound is borne on the wind?</l>
<l rend="i4">Is it the storm that shakes</l>
<l rend="i2">The thousand oaks of the forest?</l>
<l rend="i4">But Thalaba's long locks</l>
<l rend="i0">Flow down his shoulders moveless, and the wind</l>
<l rend="i0">In his loose mantle raises not one fold.</l>
<l rend="i4">Is it the river's roar</l>
<l rend="i2">Dashed down some rocky descent?</l>
<l rend="i4">Along the level plain</l>
<l rend="i4">Euphrates glides unheard.</l>
<l rend="i4">What sound disturbs the night,</l>
<l rend="i0">Loud as the summer forest in the storm,</l>
<l rend="i2">As the river that roars among rocks?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">And what the heavy cloud</l>
<l rend="i4">That hangs upon the vale,</l>
<l rend="i0">Thick as the mist o'er a well-watered plain</l>
<l rend="i0">Settling at evening, when the cooler air</l>
<l rend="i4">Lets its day-vapours fall;</l>
<l rend="i4">Black as the sulphur-cloud</l>
<l rend="i0">That thro' Vesuvius, or from Hecla's mouth</l>
<l rend="i2">Rolls up, ascending from the infernal fires.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">From Ait's bitumen<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> lake</l>
<l rend="i4">That heavy cloud ascends;</l>
<l rend="i4">That everlasting roar</l>
<l rend="i4">From where its gushing springs</l>
<l rend="i4">Boil their black billows up.</l>
<l rend="i4">Silent the Arab youth,</l>
<l rend="i2">Along the verge of that wide lake,</l>
<l rend="i4">Followed Mohareb's way</l>
<l rend="i0">Towards a ridge of rocks that banked its side.</l>
<l rend="i2">There from a cave with torrent force,</l>
<l rend="i4">And everlasting roar,</l>
<l rend="i4">The black bitumen rolled.</l>
<l rend="i2">The moonlight lay upon the rocks.</l>
<l rend="i4">Their crags were visible,</l>
<l rend="i4">The shade of jutting cliffs,</l>
<l rend="i0">And where broad lichens whitened some smooth spot,</l>
<l rend="i4">And where the ivy hung</l>
<l rend="i4">Its flowing tresses down.</l>
<l rend="i2">A little way within the cave</l>
<l rend="i0">The moonlight fell, glossing the sable tide</l>
<l rend="i4">That gushed tumultuous out.</l>
<l rend="i0">A little way it entered, then the rock</l>
<l rend="i0">Arching its entrance, and the winding way,</l>
<l rend="i4">Darkened the unseen depths.</l>
<l rend="i4">No eye of mortal man</l>
<l rend="i0">If unenabled by enchanted spell,</l>
<l rend="i4">Had pierced those fearful depths.</l>
<l rend="i4">For mingling with the roar</l>
<l rend="i0">Of the portentous torrent, oft were heard</l>
<l rend="i4">Shrieks, and wild yells that scared</l>
<l rend="i0">The brooding Eagle from her midnight nest.</l>
<l rend="i4">The affrighted countrymen</l>
<l rend="i4">Call it the Mouth of Hell;</l>
<l rend="i2">And ever when their way leads near</l>
<l rend="i2">They hurry with averted eyes,</l>
<l rend="i4">And dropping their beads<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> fast</l>
<l rend="i4">Pronounce the holy name.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">There pausing at the cavern mouth</l>
<l rend="i2">Mohareb turned to Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Now darest thou enter in?"</l>
<l rend="i4">"Behold!" the youth replied,</l>
<l rend="i0">And leading in his turn the dangerous way</l>
<l rend="i4">Set foot within the cave.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Stay Madman!" cried his comrade. "Wouldst thou rush</l>
<l rend="i4">"Headlong to certain death?</l>
<l rend="i4">"Where are thine arms to meet</l>
<l rend="i0">"The Guardian of the Passage?" a loud shriek</l>
<l rend="i0">That shook along the windings of the cave</l>
<l rend="i4">Scattered the youth's reply.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Mohareb when the long reechoing ceased</l>
<l rend="i4">Exclaimed, "Fate favoured thee,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Young Arab! when she wrote<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> upon thy brow</l>
<l rend="i4">"The meeting of to-night;</l>
<l rend="i4">"Else surely had thy name</l>
<l rend="i0">"This hour been blotted from the Book of Life!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">So saying from beneath</l>
<l rend="i4">His cloak a bag he drew;</l>
<l rend="i2">"Young Arab! thou art brave," he cried,</l>
<l rend="i0">"But thus to rush on danger unprepared,</l>
<l rend="i0">"As lions spring upon the hunter's spear,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Is blind, brute courage. Zohak<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> keeps the cave,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Giantly tyrant of primeval days.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Force cannot win the passage." Thus he said</l>
<l rend="i0">And from his wallet drew a human hand</l>
<l rend="i4">Shrivelled, and dry, and black,</l>
<l rend="i4">And fitting as he spake</l>
<l rend="i4">A taper in its hold,</l>
<l rend="i0">Pursued: "a murderer on the stake had died,</l>
<l rend="i0">"I drove the Vulture from his limbs, and lopt</l>
<l rend="i0">"The hand that did the murder, and drew up</l>
<l rend="i2">"The tendon-strings to close its grasp,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And in the sun and wind</l>
<l rend="i4">"Parched it, nine weeks exposed.</l>
<l rend="i0">"The Taper,... but not here the place to impart,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Nor hast thou done the rites,</l>
<l rend="i0">"That fit thee to partake the mystery.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Look! it burns clear, but with the air around</l>
<l rend="i0">"Its dead ingredients mingle deathiness.</l>
<l rend="i0">"This when the Keeper of the Cave shall feel,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Maugre the doom of Heaven,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The salutary<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> spell</l>
<l rend="i0">"Shall lull his penal agony to sleep</l>
<l rend="i4">"And leave the passage free."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Thalaba answered not.</l>
<l rend="i2">Nor was there time for answer now,</l>
<l rend="i4">For lo! Mohareb leads,</l>
<l rend="i4">And o'er the vaulted cave</l>
<l rend="i0">Trembles the accursed taper's feeble light.</l>
<l rend="i4">There where the narrowing chasm</l>
<l rend="i4">Rose loftier in the hill,</l>
<l rend="i0">Stood Zohak, wretched man, condemned to keep</l>
<l rend="i4">His Cave of punishment.</l>
<l rend="i4">His was the frequent scream</l>
<l rend="i0">Which far away the prowling Chacal heard</l>
<l rend="i4">And howled in terror back:</l>
<l rend="i4">For from his shoulders grew</l>
<l rend="i4">Two snakes of monster size,</l>
<l rend="i4">That ever at his head</l>
<l rend="i4">Aimed eager their keen teeth</l>
<l rend="i0">To satiate raving hunger with his brain.</l>
<l rend="i0">He in the eternal conflict oft would seize</l>
<l rend="i0">Their swelling necks, and in his giant grasp</l>
<l rend="i0">Bruise them, and rend their flesh with bloody nails,</l>
<l rend="i4">And howl for agony,</l>
<l rend="i0">Feeling the pangs he gave, for of himself</l>
<l rend="i0">Inseparable parts, his torturers grew.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">To him approaching now</l>
<l rend="i2">Mohareb held the withered arm</l>
<l rend="i2">The Taper of enchanted power.</l>
<l rend="i0">The unhallowed spell in hand unholy held</l>
<l rend="i0">Now ministered to mercy, heavily</l>
<l rend="i4">The wretche's eyelids closed,</l>
<l rend="i4">And welcome and unfelt</l>
<l rend="i4">Like the release of death</l>
<l rend="i0">A sudden sleep fell on his vital powers.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Yet tho' along the cave</l>
<l rend="i4">Lay Zohak's giant limbs,</l>
<l rend="i0">The twin-born serpents kept the narrow pass,</l>
<l rend="i4">Kindled their fiery eyes,</l>
<l rend="i0">Darted their tongues of terror, and rolled out</l>
<l rend="i4">Their undulating length,</l>
<l rend="i0">Like the long streamers of some gallant ship</l>
<l rend="i4">Buoyed on the wavy air,</l>
<l rend="i0">Still struggling to flow on and still withheld.</l>
<l rend="i4">The scent of living flesh</l>
<l rend="i4">Inflamed their appetite.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Prepared for all the perils of the cave</l>
<l rend="i0">Mohareb came. He from his wallet drew</l>
<l rend="i4">Two human heads yet warm.</l>
<l rend="i0">O hard of heart! whom not the visible power</l>
<l rend="i0">Of retributive Justice, and the doom</l>
<l rend="i4">Of Zohak in his sight,</l>
<l rend="i4">Deterred from equal crime!</l>
<l rend="i2">Two human heads, yet warm, he laid</l>
<l rend="i0">Before the scaly guardians of the pass.</l>
<l rend="i0">They to their wonted banquet of old years</l>
<l rend="i0">Turned eager, and the narrow pass was free.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">And now before their path</l>
<l rend="i4">The opening cave dilates;</l>
<l rend="i4">They reach a spacious vault</l>
<l rend="i0">Where the black river fountains burst their way.</l>
<l rend="i4">Now as a whirlwind's force</l>
<l rend="i4">Had centered on the spring,</l>
<l rend="i4">The gushing flood rolled up;</l>
<l rend="i4">And now the deadened roar</l>
<l rend="i0">Echoed beneath them, as its sudden pause</l>
<l rend="i4">Left wide a dark abyss,</l>
<l rend="i0">Adown whose fathomless gulphs the eye was lost.</l>
<l rend="i2">Blue flames that hovered o'er the springs</l>
<l rend="i0">Flung thro' the Cavern their uncertain light</l>
<l rend="i2">Now waving on the waves they lay,</l>
<l rend="i4">And now their fiery curls</l>
<l rend="i4">Flowed in long tresses up,</l>
<l rend="i0">And now contracting glowed with whiter heat.</l>
<l rend="i4">Then up they poured again</l>
<l rend="i0">Darting pale flashes thro' the tremulous air;</l>
<l rend="i0">The flames, the red and yellow sulphur-smoke,</l>
<l rend="i2">And the black darkness of the vault</l>
<l rend="i2">Commingling indivisibly.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Here," quoth Mohareb, "do the Angels dwell,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The Teachers of Enchantment." Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i4">Then raised his voice and cried,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Haruth and Maruth, hear me! not with rites</l>
<l rend="i0">"Accursed, to disturb your penitence</l>
<l rend="i4">"And learn forbidden lore,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Repentant Angels, seek I your abode.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Me Allah and the Prophet mission here,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Their chosen servant I.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Tell me the Talisman."...</l>
<l rend="i10">"And dost thou think"</l><l rend="i0">"Mohareb cried, as with a scornful smile</l>
<l rend="i0">He glanced upon his comrade, "dost thou think</l>
<l rend="i0">"To trick them of their secret? for the dupes</l>
<l rend="i0">"Of human-kind keep this lip-righteousness!</l>
<l rend="i4">"'Twill serve thee in the Mosque</l>
<l rend="i4">"And in the Market-place,</l>
<l rend="i4">"But Spirits view the heart.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Only by strong and torturing spells enforced,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Those stubborn Angels teach the charm</l>
<l rend="i4">"By which we must descend."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"Descend!" said Thalaba.</l>
<l rend="i4">But then the wrinkling smile</l>
<l rend="i4">Forsook Mohareb's cheek,</l>
<l rend="i0">And darker feelings settled on his brow.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Now by my soul," quoth he, "and I believe</l>
<l rend="i4">"Idiot! that I have led</l>
<l rend="i0">"Some camel-kneed prayer-monger thro' the cave!</l>
<l rend="i0">"What brings thee hither? thou shouldest have a hut</l>
<l rend="i0">"By some Saint's<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> grave beside the public way,</l>
<l rend="i4">"There to less-knowing fools</l>
<l rend="i4">"Retail thy Koran<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> scraps,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And in thy turn, die civet-like at last</l>
<l rend="i0">"In the dung-perfume of thy sanctity!...</l>
<l rend="i2">"Ye whom I seek! that, led by me,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Feet uninitiate tread</l>
<l rend="i4">"Your threshold, this atones!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Fit sacrifice he falls!"</l>
<l rend="i2">And forth he flashed his scymetar,</l>
<l rend="i4">And raised the murderous blow.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Then ceased his power; his lifted arm,</l>
<l rend="i4">Suspended by the spell,</l>
<l rend="i4">Hung impotent to strike.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Poor Hypocrite!" cried he,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And this then is thy faith</l>
<l rend="i0">"In Allah and the Prophet! they had failed</l>
<l rend="i0">"To save thee, but for Magic's stolen aid;</l>
<l rend="i0">"Yea, they had left thee yonder Serpent's meal,</l>
<l rend="i2">"But that, in prudent cowardice,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The chosen Servant of the Lord came in,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Safe follower of my path!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Blasphemer! dost thou boast of guiding me?"</l>
<l rend="i2">Kindling with pride quoth Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Blindly the wicked work</l>
<l rend="i4">"The righteous will of Heaven.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Sayest thou that diffident of God,</l>
<l rend="i4">"In magic spell I trust?</l>
<l rend="i4">"Liar! let witness this!"</l>
<l rend="i2">And he drew off Abdaldar's Ring</l>
<l rend="i4">And cast it in the gulph.</l>
<l rend="i4">A skinny hand came up</l>
<l rend="i4">And caught it as it fell,</l>
<l rend="i0">And peals of devilish laughter shook the Cave.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Then joy suffused Mohareb's cheek,</l>
<l rend="i4">And Thalaba beheld</l>
<l rend="i0">The blue blade gleam, descending to destroy.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The undefended youth</l>
<l rend="i4">Sprung forward, and he seized</l>
<l rend="i4">Mohareb in his grasp,</l>
<l rend="i2">And grappled with him breast to breast.</l>
<l rend="i0">Sinewy and large of limb Mohareb was,</l>
<l rend="i4">Broad-shouldered, and his joints</l>
<l rend="i4">Knit firm, and in the strife</l>
<l rend="i4">Of danger practised well.</l>
<l rend="i0">Time had not thus matured young Thalaba:</l>
<l rend="i4">But now the enthusiast mind,</l>
<l rend="i2">The inspiration of his soul</l>
<l rend="i4">Poured vigour like the strength</l>
<l rend="i4">Of madness thro' his frame.</l>
<l rend="i0">Mohareb reels before him! he right on</l>
<l rend="i4">With knee, with breast, with arm,</l>
<l rend="i4">Presses the staggering foe!</l>
<l rend="i4">And now upon the brink</l>
<l rend="i4">Of that tremendous spring,</l>
<l rend="i0">There with fresh impulse and a rush of force</l>
<l rend="i4">He thrust him from his hold.</l>
<l rend="i4">The upwhirling flood received</l>
<l rend="i4">Mohareb, then, absorbed,</l>
<l rend="i4">Engulphed him in the abyss.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Thalaba's breath came fast,</l>
<l rend="i4">And panting he breathed out</l>
<l rend="i2">A broken prayer of thankfulness.</l>
<l rend="i4">At length he spake and said,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Haruth and Maruth! are ye here?</l>
<l rend="i0">"Or has that evil guide misled my search?</l>
<l rend="i0">"I, Thalaba, the Servant of the Lord,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Invoke you. Hear me Angels! so may Heaven</l>
<l rend="i0">"Accept and mitigate your penitence.</l>
<l rend="i0">"I go to root from earth the Sorcerer brood,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Tell me the needful Talisman!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Thus as he spake, recumbent on the rock</l>
<l rend="i4">Beyond the black abyss,</l>
<l rend="i4">Their forms grew visible.</l>
<l rend="i0">A settled sorrow sate upon their brows,</l>
<l rend="i0">Sorrow alone, for trace of guilt and shame</l>
<l rend="i0">No more remained; and gradual as by prayer</l>
<l rend="i4">The sin was purged away,</l>
<l rend="i0">Their robe<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> of glory, purified of stain</l>
<l rend="i0">Resumed the lustre of its native light.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">In awe the youth received the answering voice,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Son of Hodeirah! thou hast proved it here;</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Talisman is Faith."</l></lg>

<div type="book"><head>THE SIXTH BOOK.</head><lg>
<l rend="i0">So from the inmost cavern, Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i2">Retrod the windings of the rock.</l>
<l rend="i2">Still on the ground the giant limbs</l>
<l rend="i4">Of Zohak were outstretched;</l>
<l rend="i4">The spell of sleep had ceased</l>
<l rend="i0">And his broad eyes were glaring on the youth:</l>
<l rend="i0">Yet raised he not his arm to bar the way,</l>
<l rend="i4">Fearful to rouse the snakes</l>
<l rend="i4">Now lingering o'er their meal.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Oh then, emerging from that dreadful cave,</l>
<l rend="i2">How grateful did the gale of night</l>
<l rend="i4">Salute his freshened sense!</l>
<l rend="i4">How full of lightsome joy,</l>
<l rend="i0">Thankful to Heaven, he hastens by the verge</l>
<l rend="i4">Of that bitumen lake,</l>
<l rend="i4">Whose black and heavy fumes,</l>
<l rend="i4">Surge heaving after surge,</l>
<l rend="i0">Rolled like the billowy and tumultuous sea.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">The song of many a bird at morn</l>
<l rend="i4">Aroused him from his rest.</l>
<l rend="i2">Lo! by his side a courser stood!</l>
<l rend="i4">More animate of eye,</l>
<l rend="i0">Of form more faultless never had he seen,</l>
<l rend="i0">More light of limbs and beautiful in strength,</l>
<l rend="i4">Among the race whose blood,</l>
<l rend="i0">Pure and unmingled, from the royal steeds</l>
<l rend="i4">Of <a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>Solomon came down.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The chosen Arab's eye</l>
<l rend="i4">Glanced o'er his graceful shape,</l>
<l rend="i4">His rich caparisons,</l>
<l rend="i4">His crimson trappings gay.</l>
<l rend="i4">But when he saw the mouth</l>
<l rend="i4">Uncurbed, the unbridled neck,</l>
<l rend="i2">Then flushed his cheek, and leapt his heart,</l>
<l rend="i2">For sure he deemed that Heaven had sent</l>
<l rend="i0">The Courser, whom no erring hand should guide.</l>
<l rend="i4">And lo! the eager Steed</l>
<l rend="i2">Throws his head and paws the ground,</l>
<l rend="i4">Impatient of delay!</l>
<l rend="i4">Then up leapt Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i2">And away went the self-governed steed.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Far over the plain</l>
<l rend="i2">Away went the bridleless steed;</l>
<l rend="i0">With the dew of the morning his fetlocks were wet,</l>
<l rend="i0">The foam frothed his limbs in the journey of noon,</l>
<l rend="i0">Nor stayed he till over the westerly heaven</l>
<l rend="i2">The shadows of evening had spread.</l>
<l rend="i4">Then on a sheltered bank</l>
<l rend="i4">The appointed Youth reposed,</l>
<l rend="i0">And by him laid the docile courser down.</l>
<l rend="i2">Again in the grey of the morning</l>
<l rend="i4">Thalaba bounded up,</l>
<l rend="i4">Over hill, over dale</l>
<l rend="i2">Away goes the bridleless steed.</l>
<l rend="i4">Again at eve he stops</l>
<l rend="i4">Again the Youth descends.</l>
<l rend="i2">His load discharged, his errand done,</l>
<l rend="i2">Then bounded the courser away.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Heavy and dark the eve;</l>
<l rend="i4">The Moon was hid on high,</l>
<l rend="i2">A dim light only tinged the mist</l>
<l rend="i2">That crost her in the path of Heaven.</l>
<l rend="i4">All living sounds had ceased,</l>
<l rend="i0">Only the flow of waters near was heard,</l>
<l rend="i2">A low and lulling melody.</l>
<l rend="i4">Fasting, yet not of want</l>
<l rend="i0">Percipient, he on that mysterious steed</l>
<l rend="i4">Had reached his resting place,</l>
<l rend="i0">For expectation kept his nature up.</l>
<l rend="i4">The flow of waters now</l>
<l rend="i4">Awoke a feverish thirst:</l>
<l rend="i4">Led by the sound, he moved</l>
<l rend="i4">To seek the grateful wave.</l>
<l rend="i2">A meteor in the hazy air</l>
<l rend="i4">Played before his path;</l>
<l rend="i4">Before him now it rolled</l>
<l rend="i4">A globe of livid fire;</l>
<l rend="i0">And now contracted to a steady light,</l>
<l rend="i0">As when the solitary hermit prunes</l>
<l rend="i2">His lamp's long undulating flame:</l>
<l rend="i4">And now its wavy point</l>
<l rend="i0">Up-blazing rose, like a young cypress-tree</l>
<l rend="i4">Swayed by the heavy wind;</l>
<l rend="i2">Anon to Thalaba it moved,</l>
<l rend="i0">And wrapped him in its pale innocuous fire:</l>
<l rend="i4">Now in the darkness drowned</l>
<l rend="i4">Left him with eyes bedimmed,</l>
<l rend="i0">And now emerging<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> spread the scene to sight.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Led by the sound, and meteor-flame</l>
<l rend="i4">Advanced the Arab youth.</l>
<l rend="i0">Now to the nearest of the many rills</l>
<l rend="i4">He stoops; ascending steam</l>
<l rend="i4">Timely repels his hand,</l>
<l rend="i0">For from its source it sprung, a boiling tide.</l>
<l rend="i0">A second course with better hap he tries,</l>
<l rend="i4">The wave intensly cold</l>
<l rend="i4">Tempts to a copious draught.</l>
<l rend="i2">There was a virtue in the wave,</l>
<l rend="i4">His limbs that stiff with toil,</l>
<l rend="i0">Dragged heavy, from the copious draught received</l>
<l rend="i4">Lightness and supple strength.</l>
<l rend="i0">O'erjoyed, and deeming the benignant Power</l>
<l rend="i4">Who sent the reinless steed,</l>
<l rend="i0">Had blessed the healing waters to his use</l>
<l rend="i4">He laid him down to sleep;</l>
<l rend="i0">Lulled by the soothing and incessant sound,</l>
<l rend="i0">The flow of many waters, blending oft</l>
<l rend="i0">With shriller tones and deep low murmurings</l>
<l rend="i4">That from the fountain caves</l>
<l rend="i4">In mingled melody</l>
<l rend="i0">Like faery music, heard at midnight, came.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">The sounds that last he heard at night</l>
<l rend="i4">Awoke his sense at morn.</l>
<l rend="i0">A scene of wonders lay before his eyes.</l>
<l rend="i2">In mazy windings o'er the vale</l>
<l rend="i4">Wandered a thousand streams;</l>
<l rend="i0">They in their endless flow<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> had channelled deep</l>
<l rend="i2">The rocky soil o'er which they ran,</l>
<l rend="i2">Veining its thousand islet stones,</l>
<l rend="i0">Like clouds that freckle o'er the summer sky,</l>
<l rend="i0">The blue etherial ocean circling each</l>
<l rend="i4">And insulating all.</l>
<l rend="i0">A thousand shapes they wore, those islet stones,</l>
<l rend="i2">And Nature with her various tints</l>
<l rend="i2">Varied anew their thousand forms:</l>
<l rend="i4">For some were green with moss,</l>
<l rend="i2">Some rich with yellow lichen's gold,</l>
<l rend="i0">Or ruddier tinged, or grey, or silver-white,</l>
<l rend="i0">Or sparkling sparry radiance to the sun.</l>
<l rend="i4">Here gushed the fountains up,</l>
<l rend="i0">Alternate light and blackness, like the play</l>
<l rend="i0">Of sunbeams, on the warrior's burnished arms.</l>
<l rend="i2">Yonder the river rolled, whose bed,</l>
<l rend="i2">Their labyrinthine lingerings o'er</l>
<l rend="i4">Received the confluent rills.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">This was a wild and wonderous scene,</l>
<l rend="i2">Strange and beautiful, as where</l>
<l rend="i0">By Oton-tala, like a sea<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> of stars,</l>
<l rend="i0">The hundred sources of Hoangho burst.</l>
<l rend="i4">High mountains closed the vale,</l>
<l rend="i0">Bare rocky mountains, to all living things</l>
<l rend="i0">Inhospitable, on whose sides no herb</l>
<l rend="i0">Rooted, no insect fed, no bird awoke</l>
<l rend="i0">Their echoes, save the Eagle, strong of wing,</l>
<l rend="i2">A lonely plunderer, that afar</l>
<l rend="i4">Sought in the vales his prey.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Thither towards those mountains, Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i0">Advanced, for well he weened that there had Fate</l>
<l rend="i4">Destined the adventures end.</l>
<l rend="i0">Up a wide vale winding amid their depths,</l>
<l rend="i0">A stony vale between receding heights</l>
<l rend="i4">Of stone, he wound his way.</l>
<l rend="i0">A cheerless place! the solitary Bee</l>
<l rend="i0">Whose buzzing was the only sound of life</l>
<l rend="i4">Flew there on restless wing,</l>
<l rend="i0">Seeking in vain one blossom, where to fix.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Still Thalaba holds on,</l>
<l rend="i0">The winding vale now narrows on his way,</l>
<l rend="i4">And steeper of ascent</l>
<l rend="i2">Rightward and leftward rise the rocks,</l>
<l rend="i2">And now they meet across the vale.</l>
<l rend="i2">Was it the toil of human hands</l>
<l rend="i2">That hewed a passage in the rock,</l>
<l rend="i4">Thro' whose rude portal-way</l>
<l rend="i4">The light of heaven was seen?</l>
<l rend="i2">Rude and low the portal-way,</l>
<l rend="i2">Beyond the same<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> ascending straits</l>
<l rend="i4">Went winding up the wilds.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Still a bare, silent, solitary glen,</l>
<l rend="i0">A fearful silence and a solitude</l>
<l rend="i4">That made itself be felt.</l>
<l rend="i4">And steeper now the ascent,</l>
<l rend="i4">A rugged path, that tired</l>
<l rend="i0">The straining muscles, toiling slowly up.</l>
<l rend="i4">At length again a rock</l>
<l rend="i4">Stretched o'er the narrow vale.</l>
<l rend="i2">There also was a portal hewn,</l>
<l rend="i0">But gates of massy iron barred the way,</l>
<l rend="i4">Huge, solid, heavy-hinged.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">There hung a horn beside the gate,</l>
<l rend="i2">Ivory-tipt and brazen mouthed,</l>
<l rend="i4">He took the ivory tip,</l>
<l rend="i2">And thro' the brazen mouth he breathed;</l>
<l rend="i0">From rock to rock rebounding rung the blast,</l>
<l rend="i2">Like a long thunder peal!</l>
<l rend="i0">The gates of iron, by no human arm</l>
<l rend="i0">Unfolded, turning on their hinges slow,</l>
<l rend="i2">Disclosed the passage of the rock.</l>
<l rend="i2">He entered, and the iron gates</l>
<l rend="i4">Fell to, and closed him in.</l>
<l rend="i2">It was a narrow winding way,</l>
<l rend="i2">Dim lamps suspended from the vault</l>
<l rend="i0">Lent to the gloom an agitated light.</l>
<l rend="i4">Winding it pierced the rock,</l>
<l rend="i4">A long descending path</l>
<l rend="i4">By gates of iron closed;</l>
<l rend="i2">There also hung the horn beside</l>
<l rend="i2">Of ivory tip and brazen mouth,</l>
<l rend="i2">Again he took the ivory tip</l>
<l rend="i0">And gave the brazen mouth his voice again.</l>
<l rend="i2">Not now in thunder spake the horn,</l>
<l rend="i0">But poured a sweet and thrilling melody:</l>
<l rend="i0">The gates flew open, and a flood of light</l>
<l rend="i4">Rushed on his dazzled eyes.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Was it to earthly Eden lost so long,</l>
<l rend="i2">The youth had found the wonderous way?</l>
<l rend="i4">But earthly Eden boasts</l>
<l rend="i4">No terraced palaces,</l>
<l rend="i0">No rich pavilions bright with woven<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> gold.</l>
<l rend="i4">Like these that in the vale</l>
<l rend="i4">Rise amid odorous groves.</l>
<l rend="i4">The astonished Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i0">Doubting as tho' an unsubstantial dream</l>
<l rend="i4">Beguiled his passive sense,</l>
<l rend="i4">A moment closed his eyes;</l>
<l rend="i0">Still they were there ... the palaces and groves,</l>
<l rend="i0">And rich pavilions glittering golden light.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">And lo! a man, reverend in comely age</l>
<l rend="i4">Advancing meets the youth.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Favoured of Fortune," he exclaimed,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Go taste the joys of Paradise!</l>
<l rend="i0">"The reinless steed that ranges o'er the world</l>
<l rend="i0">"Brings hither those alone for lofty deeds</l>
<l rend="i0">"Marked by their horoscope; permitted here</l>
<l rend="i0">"A foretaste of the full beatitude,</l>
<l rend="i0">"That in heroic acts they may go on</l>
<l rend="i0">"More ardent, eager to return and reap</l>
<l rend="i0">"Endless enjoyment here, their destined meed.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Favoured of Fortune thou,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Go taste the joys of Paradise!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">This said, he turned away, and left</l>
<l rend="i4">The Youth in wonder mute;</l>
<l rend="i4">For Thalaba stood mute</l>
<l rend="i4">And passively received</l>
<l rend="i0">The mingled joy that flowed on every sense.</l>
<l rend="i4">Where'er his eye could reach</l>
<l rend="i2">Fair structures, rain bow-hued, arose;</l>
<l rend="i0">And rich pavilions thro' the opening woods</l>
<l rend="i0">Gleamed from their waving curtains sunny gold;</l>
<l rend="i2">And winding thro' the verdant vale</l>
<l rend="i4">Flowed streams of liquid light;</l>
<l rend="i2">And fluted cypresses reared up</l>
<l rend="i4">Their living obelisks;</l>
<l rend="i0">And broad-leaved<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Zennars in long colonades</l>
<l rend="i4">O'er-arched delightful walks,</l>
<l rend="i0">Where round their trunks the thousand-tendril'd vine</l>
<l rend="i0">Wound up and hung the bows with greener wreaths,</l>
<l rend="i4">And clusters not their own.</l>
<l rend="i0">Wearied with endless beauty did his eyes</l>
<l rend="i0">Return for rest? beside him teems the earth</l>
<l rend="i0">With tulips, like the ruddy<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> evening streaked,</l>
<l rend="i0">And here the lily hangs her head of snow,</l>
<l rend="i2">And here amid her sable<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> cup</l>
<l rend="i0">Shines the red eye-spot, like one brightest star</l>
<l rend="i0">The solitary twinkler of the night,</l>
<l rend="i4">And here the rose expands</l>
<l rend="i4">Her paradise<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> of leaves.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Then on his ear what sounds</l>
<l rend="i4">Of harmony arose!</l>
<l rend="i0">Far music and the distance-mellowed song</l>
<l rend="i4">From bowers of merriment;</l>
<l rend="i4">The waterfall remote;</l>
<l rend="i2">The murmuring of the leafy groves;</l>
<l rend="i4">The single nightingale</l>
<l rend="i0">Perched in the Rosier by, so richly toned,</l>
<l rend="i0">That never from that most melodious bird,</l>
<l rend="i0">Singing a love-song to his brooding mate,</l>
<l rend="i2">Did Thracian shepherd by the grave</l>
<l rend="i2">Of Orpheus<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> hear a sweeter song;</l>
<l rend="i0">Tho' there the Spirit of the Sepulchre</l>
<l rend="i2">All his own power infuse, to swell</l>
<l rend="i4">The incense that he loves.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">And oh! what odours the voluptuous vale</l>
<l rend="i4">Scatters from jasmine bowers.</l>
<l rend="i4">From yon rose wilderness,</l>
<l rend="i0">From clustered henna, and from orange groves</l>
<l rend="i2">That with such perfumes fill the breeze,</l>
<l rend="i2">As Peris to their Sister bear,</l>
<l rend="i0">When from the summit of some lofty tree</l>
<l rend="i0">She hangs encaged, the captive of the Dives.</l>
<l rend="i4">They from their pinions shake</l>
<l rend="i2">The sweetness of celestial flowers,</l>
<l rend="i2">And as her enemies impure</l>
<l rend="i0">From that impervious poison far away</l>
<l rend="i0">Fly groaning with the torment, she the while</l>
<l rend="i4">Inhales her fragrant<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> food.</l>
<l rend="i2">Such odours flowed upon the world</l>
<l rend="i2">When at Mohammed's nuptials, word</l>
<l rend="i4">Went forth in Heaven to roll</l>
<l rend="i0">The everlasting gates of Paradise</l>
<l rend="i0">Back on their living hinges, that its gales</l>
<l rend="i0">Might visit all below; the general bliss</l>
<l rend="i0">Thrilled every bosom, and the family</l>
<l rend="i0">Of man, for once<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> partook one common joy.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Full of the joy, yet still awake</l>
<l rend="i2">To wonder, on went Thalaba;</l>
<l rend="i2">On every side the song of mirth,</l>
<l rend="i2">The music of festivity,</l>
<l rend="i4">Invite the passing youth.</l>
<l rend="i0">Wearied at length with hunger and with heat</l>
<l rend="i2">He enters in a banquet room,</l>
<l rend="i4">Where round a fountain brink,</l>
<l rend="i0">On silken<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> carpets sate the festive train.</l>
<l rend="i4">Instant thro' all his frame</l>
<l rend="i4">Delightful coolness spread;</l>
<l rend="i4">The playing fount refreshed</l>
<l rend="i4">The agitated air;</l>
<l rend="i0">The very light came cooled thro' silvering panes</l>
<l rend="i0">Of pearly<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> shell, like the pale moon-beam tinged;</l>
<l rend="i0">Or where the wine-vase<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> filled the aperture,</l>
<l rend="i0">Rosy as rising morn, or softer gleam</l>
<l rend="i0">Of saffron, like the sunny evening mist:</l>
<l rend="i2">Thro' every hue, and streaked by all</l>
<l rend="i4">The flowing fountain played.</l>
<l rend="i4">Around the water-edge</l>
<l rend="i2">Vessels of wine, alternate placed,</l>
<l rend="i0">Ruby and amber, tinged its little waves.</l>
<l rend="i4">From golden goblets there<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></l>
<l rend="i0">The guests sate quaffing the delicious juice</l>
<l rend="i4">Of Shiraz' golden grape.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">But Thalaba took not the draught</l>
<l rend="i0">For rightly he knew had the Prophet forbidden</l>
<l rend="i2">That beverage the mother<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> of sins.</l>
<l rend="i4">Nor did the urgent guests</l>
<l rend="i0">Proffer a second time the liquid fire</l>
<l rend="i2">For in the youth's strong eye they saw</l>
<l rend="i4">No moveable resolve.</l>
<l rend="i2">Yet not uncourteous, Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i2">Drank the cool draught of innocence,</l>
<l rend="i2">That fragrant from its dewy<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> vase</l>
<l rend="i0">Came purer than it left its native bed.</l>
<l rend="i2">And he partook the odorous fruits,</l>
<l rend="i4">For all rich fruits were there.</l>
<l rend="i4">Water-melons rough of rind,</l>
<l rend="i4">Whose pulp the thirsty lip</l>
<l rend="i4">Dissolved into a draught:</l>
<l rend="i0">Pistachios from the heavy-clustered trees</l>
<l rend="i0">Of Malavert, or Haleb's fertile soil,</l>
<l rend="i0">And Casbin's<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> luscious grapes of amber hue,</l>
<l rend="i4">That many a week endure</l>
<l rend="i4">The summer sun intense,</l>
<l rend="i4">Till by its powerful fire</l>
<l rend="i0">All watery particles exhaled, alone</l>
<l rend="i0">The strong essential sweetness ripens there.</l>
<l rend="i2">Here cased in ice, the <a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>apricot,</l>
<l rend="i4">A topaz, crystal-set:</l>
<l rend="i4">Here on a plate of snow</l>
<l rend="i4">The sunny orange rests,</l>
<l rend="i0">And still the aloes and the sandal-wood</l>
<l rend="i0">From golden censers o'er the banquet room</l>
<l rend="i4">Diffuse their dying sweets.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Anon a troop of females formed the dance</l>
<l rend="i2">Their ancles bound with <a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>bracelet-bells</l>
<l rend="i0">That made the modulating harmony.</l>
<l rend="i0">Transparent<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> garments to the greedy eye</l>
<l rend="i4">Gave all their harlot limbs,</l>
<l rend="i0">That writhed, in each immodest gesture skilled.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">With earnest eyes the banqueters</l>
<l rend="i4">Fed on the sight impure;</l>
<l rend="i4">And Thalaba, he gazed,</l>
<l rend="i0">But in his heart he bore a talisman</l>
<l rend="i4">Whose blessed Alchemy</l>
<l rend="i4">To virtuous thoughts refined</l>
<l rend="i0">The loose suggestions of the scene impure.</l>
<l rend="i0">Oneiza's image swam before his sight,</l>
<l rend="i4">His own Arabian Maid.</l>
<l rend="i0">He rose, and from the banquet room he rushed,</l>
<l rend="i2">And tears ran down his burning cheek,</l>
<l rend="i0">And nature for a moment woke the thought</l>
<l rend="i0">And murmured, that from all domestic joys</l>
<l rend="i2">Estranged, he wandered o'er the world</l>
<l rend="i0">A lonely being, far from all he loved.</l>
<l rend="i0">Son of Hodeirah, not among thy crimes</l>
<l rend="i2">That murmur shall be written!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">From tents of revelry,</l>
<l rend="i0">From festal bowers, to solitude he ran,</l>
<l rend="i2">And now he reached where all the rills</l>
<l rend="i0">Of that well-watered garden in one tide</l>
<l rend="i4">Rolled their collected waves.</l>
<l rend="i4">A straight and stately bridge</l>
<l rend="i0">Stretched its long arches o'er the ample stream.</l>
<l rend="i0">Strong in the evening and distinct its shade</l>
<l rend="i0">Lay on the watry mirror, and his eye</l>
<l rend="i0">Saw it united with its parent pile</l>
<l rend="i0">One huge fantastic fabric. Drawing near,</l>
<l rend="i0">Loud from the chambers<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> of the bridge below,</l>
<l rend="i2">Sounds of carousal came and song,</l>
<l rend="i0">And unveiled women bade the advancing youth</l>
<l rend="i4">Come merry-make with them.</l>
<l rend="i0">Unhearing or unheeding, Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i4">Past o'er with hurried pace,</l>
<l rend="i0">And plunged amid the forest solitude.</l>
<l rend="i4">Deserts of Araby!</l>
<l rend="i4">His soul returned to you.</l>
<l rend="i2">He cast himself upon the earth</l>
<l rend="i4">And closed his eyes, and called</l>
<l rend="i2">The voluntary vision up.</l>
<l rend="i4">A cry as of distress</l>
<l rend="i2">Aroused him; loud it came, and near!</l>
<l rend="i2">He started up, he strung his bow,</l>
<l rend="i4">He plucked the arrow forth.</l>
<l rend="i2">Again a shriek ... a woman's shriek!</l>
<l rend="i2">And lo! she rushes thro' the trees,</l>
<l rend="i2">Her veil all rent, her garments torn!</l>
<l rend="i2">He follows close, the ravisher....</l>
<l rend="i4">Even on the unechoing grass</l>
<l rend="i4">She hears his tread, so close!</l>
<l rend="i2">"Prophet save me! save me God!</l>
<l rend="i2">"Help! help!" she cried to Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i4">Thalaba drew the bow.</l>
<l rend="i0">The unerring arrow did its work of death.</l>
<l rend="i0">He turned him to the woman, and beheld</l>
<l rend="i0">His own Oneiza, his Arabian Maid.</l></lg>

<l rend="i0">Threw around Thalaba her arms and cried,</l>
<l rend="i0">"My father! O my father!" Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i0">In wonder lost, yet fearful to enquire,</l>
<l rend="i4">Bent down his cheek on hers,</l>
<l rend="i2">And their tears mingled as they fell.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">ONEIZA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">At night they seized me, Thalaba! in my sleep,...</l>
<l rend="i0">Thou wert not near,... and yet when in their grasp</l>
<l rend="i0">I woke, my shriek of terror called on thee.</l>
<l rend="i0">My father could not save me,... an old man!</l>
<l rend="i0">And they were strong and many,... O my God,</l>
<l rend="i0">The hearts they must have had to hear his prayers,</l>
<l rend="i0">And yet to leave him childless!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i12">We will seek him.</l><l rend="i0">We will return to Araby.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">ONEIZA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i10">Alas!</l><l rend="i0">We should not find him, Thalaba! our tent</l>
<l rend="i0">Is desolate, the wind hath heaped the sands</l>
<l rend="i0">Within its door, the lizard's<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> track is left</l>
<l rend="i0">Fresh on the untrodden dust; prowling by night</l>
<l rend="i0">The tyger, as he passes hears no breath</l>
<l rend="i0">Of man, and turns to search its solitude.</l>
<l rend="i0">Alas! he strays a wretched wanderer</l>
<l rend="i0">Seeking his child! old man, he will not rest,...</l>
<l rend="i0">He cannot rest, his sleep is misery,</l>
<l rend="i0">His dreams are of my wretchedness, my wrongs....</l>
<l rend="i0">O Thalaba! this is a wicked place!</l>
<l rend="i0">Let us be gone!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i6">But how to pass again</l>
<l rend="i0">The iron doors that opening at a breath</l>
<l rend="i0">Gave easy entrance? armies in their strength,</l>
<l rend="i0">Would fail to move those hinges for return!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">ONEIZA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">But we can climb the mountains that shut in</l>
<l rend="i0">This dreadful garden.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">Are Oneiza's limbs</l>
<l rend="i0">Equal to that long toil?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">ONEIZA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">   Oh I am strong</l>
<l rend="i0">Dear Thalaba! for this ... fear gives me force,</l>
<l rend="i0">And you are with me!</l>
<l rend="i8">So she took his hand,</l>
<l rend="i0">And gently drew him forward, and they went</l>
<l rend="i4">Towards the mountain chain.</l>
<l rend="i0">It was broad moonlight, and obscure or lost</l>
<l rend="i4">The garden beauties lay,</l>
<l rend="i0">But the great boundary rose, distinctly marked.</l>
<l rend="i4">These were no little hills,</l>
<l rend="i0">No sloping uplands lifting to the sun</l>
<l rend="i0">Their vine-yards, with fresh verdure, and the shade</l>
<l rend="i0">Of ancient woods, courting the loiterer</l>
<l rend="i0">To win the easy ascent: stone mountains these</l>
<l rend="i4">Desolate rock on rock,</l>
<l rend="i4">The burthens of the earth,</l>
<l rend="i0">Whose snowy summits met the morning beam</l>
<l rend="i0">When night was in the vale, whose feet were fixed</l>
<l rend="i0">In the world's<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> foundations. Thalaba surveyed</l>
<l rend="i4">The heights precipitous,</l>
<l rend="i0">Impending crags, rocks unascendible,</l>
<l rend="i0">And summits that had tired the eagle's wing;</l>
<l rend="i4">"There is no way!" he cried.</l>
<l rend="i4">Paler Oneiza grew</l>
<l rend="i0">And hung upon his arm a feebler weight.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">But soon again to hope</l>
<l rend="i4">Revives the Arabian maid,</l>
<l rend="i0">As Thalaba imparts the sudden thought.</l>
<l rend="i2">"I past a river," cried the youth</l>
<l rend="i4">"A full and copious stream.</l>
<l rend="i0">"The flowing waters cannot be restrained</l>
<l rend="i2">"And where they find or force their way,</l>
<l rend="i0">"There we perchance may follow, thitherward</l>
<l rend="i4">"The current rolled along."</l>
<l rend="i2">So saying yet again in hope</l>
<l rend="i4">Quickening their eager steps</l>
<l rend="i4">They turned them thitherward.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Silent and calm the river rolled along,</l>
<l rend="i4">And at the verge arrived</l>
<l rend="i0">Of that fair garden, o'er a rocky bed</l>
<l rend="i4">Towards the mountain base,</l>
<l rend="i0">Still full and silent, held its even way,</l>
<l rend="i4">But the deep sound, the dash</l>
<l rend="i0">Louder and louder in the distance rose,</l>
<l rend="i4">As if it forced its stream</l>
<l rend="i0">Struggling with crags along a narrow pass.</l>
<l rend="i0">And lo! where raving o'er a hollow course</l>
<l rend="i4">The ever-flowing tide</l>
<l rend="i0">Foams in a thousand whirlpools! there adown</l>
<l rend="i4">The perforated rock</l>
<l rend="i0">Plunge the whole waters, so precipitous,</l>
<l rend="i4">So fathomless a fall</l>
<l rend="i0">That their earth-shaking roar came deadened up</l>
<l rend="i0">Like subterranean thunders.</l>
<l rend="i10">  "Allah save us!"</l><l rend="i0">Oneiza cried, "there is no path for man</l>
<l rend="i4">"From this accursed place!"</l>
<l rend="i4">And as she spake her joints</l>
<l rend="i0">Were loosened, and her knees sunk under her.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Cheer up, Oneiza!" Thalaba replied,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Be of good heart. We cannot fly</l>
<l rend="i4">"The dangers of the place,</l>
<l rend="i4">"But we can conquer them!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">And the young Arab's soul</l>
<l rend="i0">Arose within him; "what is he," he cried,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Who has prepared this garden of delight,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And wherefore are its snares?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The Arabian Maid replied,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The Women when I entered, welcomed me</l>
<l rend="i0">"To Paradise, by Aloadin's will</l>
<l rend="i0">"Chosen like themselves, a Houri of the Earth.</l>
<l rend="i0">"They told me, credulous of his blasphemies,</l>
<l rend="i0">"That Aloadin placed them to reward</l>
<l rend="i0">"His faithful servants with the joys of Heaven.</l>
<l rend="i0">"O Thalaba, and all are ready here</l>
<l rend="i0">"To wreak his wicked will, and work all crimes!</l>
<l rend="i4">"How then shall we escape?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Woe to him!" cried the Appointed, a stern smile</l>
<l rend="i0">Darkening with stronger shades his countenance,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Woe to him! he hath laid his toils</l>
<l rend="i4">"To take the Antelope,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Lion is come in!"</l>
<l rend="i2">She shook her head, "a Sorcerer he</l>
<l rend="i0">"And guarded by so many! Thalaba,...</l>
<l rend="i0">"And thou but one!"</l>
<l rend="i8">He raised his hand to Heaven,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Is there not God, Oneiza?</l>
<l rend="i0">"I have a Talisman, that, whoso bears,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Him, nor the Earthly, nor the Infernal Powers</l>
<l rend="i4">"Of Evil can cast down.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Remember Destiny</l>
<l rend="i4">"Hath marked me from mankind!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Now rest in faith, and I will guard thy sleep!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">So on a violet bank</l>
<l rend="i4">The Arabian Maid lay down,</l>
<l rend="i0">Her soft cheek pillowed upon moss and flowers.</l>
<l rend="i4">She lay in silent prayer,</l>
<l rend="i2">Till prayer had tranquillized her fears,</l>
<l rend="i2">And sleep fell on her. By her side</l>
<l rend="i4">Silent sate Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i4">And gazed upon the Maid,</l>
<l rend="i4">And as he gazed, drew in</l>
<l rend="i2">New courage and intenser faith,</l>
<l rend="i0">And waited calmly for the eventful day.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Loud sung the Lark, the awakened Maid</l>
<l rend="i0">Beheld him twinkling in the morning light,</l>
<l rend="i0">And wished for wings and liberty like his.</l>
<l rend="i2">The flush of fear inflamed her cheek,</l>
<l rend="i2">But Thalaba was calm of soul,</l>
<l rend="i4">Collected for the work.</l>
<l rend="i4">He pondered in his mind</l>
<l rend="i4">How from Lobaba's breast</l>
<l rend="i4">His blunted arrow fell.</l>
<l rend="i4">Aloadin too might wear</l>
<l rend="i4">Spell perchance of equal power</l>
<l rend="i4">To blunt the weapon's edge!</l>
<l rend="i4">Beside the river-brink,</l>
<l rend="i0">Rose a young poplar, whose unsteady leaves</l>
<l rend="i2">Varying their verdure to the gale,</l>
<l rend="i4">With silver glitter caught</l>
<l rend="i4">His meditating eye.</l>
<l rend="i2">Then to Oneiza turned the youth</l>
<l rend="i4">And gave his father's bow,</l>
<l rend="i4">And o'er her shoulders slung</l>
<l rend="i4">The quiver arrow-stored.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Me other weapon suits;" said he,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Bear thou the Bow: dear Maid!</l>
<l rend="i0">"The days return upon me, when these shafts,</l>
<l rend="i0">"True to thy guidance, from the lofty palm</l>
<l rend="i0">"Brought down the cluster, and thy gladdened eye</l>
<l rend="i0">"Exulting turned to seek the voice of praise.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Oh! yet again Oneiza, we shall share</l>
<l rend="i0">"Our desert joys!"</l>
<l rend="i6">  So saying to the bank</l>
<l rend="i4">He moved, and stooping low,</l>
<l rend="i0">With double grasp, hand below hand, he clenched</l>
<l rend="i4">And from its watry soil</l>
<l rend="i4">Uptore the poplar trunk.</l>
<l rend="i2">Then off he shook the clotted earth,</l>
<l rend="i4">And broke away the head</l>
<l rend="i4">And boughs and lesser roots,</l>
<l rend="i4">And lifting it aloft</l>
<l rend="i0">Wielded with able sway the massy club.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Now for this child of Hell!" quoth Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Belike he shall exchange to day</l>
<l rend="i4">"His dainty Paradise</l>
<l rend="i2">"For other dwelling, and the fruit</l>
<l rend="i4">"Of Zaccoum,<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> cursed tree."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">With that the youth and Arab maid</l>
<l rend="i2">Towards the garden centre past.</l>
<l rend="i0">It chanced that Aloadin had convoked</l>
<l rend="i4">The garden-habitants,</l>
<l rend="i4">And with the assembled throng</l>
<l rend="i0">Oneiza mingled, and the appointed youth.</l>
<l rend="i2">Unmarked they mingled, or if one</l>
<l rend="i0">With busier finger to his neighbour notes</l>
<l rend="i2">The quivered Maid, "haply," he says,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Some daughter of the<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Homerites,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Or one who yet remembers with delight</l>
<l rend="i0">"Her native tents of Himiar!" "Nay!" rejoins</l>
<l rend="i0">His comrade, "a love-pageant! for the man</l>
<l rend="i0">"Mimics with that fierce eye and knotty club</l>
<l rend="i0">"Some savage lion-tamer, she forsooth</l>
<l rend="i0">"Must play the heroine of the years of old!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Radiant with gems upon his throne of gold</l>
<l rend="i4">Aloadin sate.</l>
<l rend="i4">O'er the Sorcerer's head</l>
<l rend="i0">Hovered a Bird, and in the fragrant air</l>
<l rend="i4">Waved his winnowing wings,</l>
<l rend="i4">A living canopy.</l>
<l rend="i2">Large as the plumeless Cassowar</l>
<l rend="i4">Was that o'ershadowing Bird;</l>
<l rend="i2">So huge his talons, in their grasp</l>
<l rend="i0">The Eagle would have hung a helpless prey.</l>
<l rend="i2">His beak was iron, and his plumes</l>
<l rend="i4">Glittered like burnished gold,</l>
<l rend="i0">And his eyes glowed, as tho' an inward fire</l>
<l rend="i4">Shone thro' a diamond orb.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The blinded multitude</l>
<l rend="i4">Adored the Sorcerer,</l>
<l rend="i2">And bent the knee before him,</l>
<l rend="i4">And shouted out his praise,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Mighty art thou, the Bestower of joy,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Lord of Paradise!"</l>
<l rend="i4">Aloadin waved his hand,</l>
<l rend="i2">In idolizing reverence</l>
<l rend="i4">Moveless they stood and mute.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Children of Earth," he cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Whom I have guided here</l>
<l rend="i0">"By easier passage than the gate of Death,</l>
<l rend="i2">"The infidel Sultan to whose lands</l>
<l rend="i4">"My mountains reach their roots,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Blasphemes and threatens me.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Strong are his armies, many are his guards,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Yet may a dagger find him.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Children of Earth, I tempt you not</l>
<l rend="i0">"With the vain promise of a bliss unseen,</l>
<l rend="i2">"With tales of a hereafter Heaven</l>
<l rend="i2">"Whence never Traveller hath returned!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Have ye not tasted of the cup of joy,</l>
<l rend="i2">"That in these groves of happiness</l>
<l rend="i2">"For ever over-mantling tempts</l>
<l rend="i4">"The ever-thirsty lip?</l>
<l rend="i2">"Who is there here that by a deed</l>
<l rend="i4">"Of danger will deserve</l>
<l rend="i0">"The eternal joys of actual Paradise?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"I!" Thalaba exclaimed,</l>
<l rend="i0">And springing forward, on the Sorcerer's head</l>
<l rend="i4">He dashed the knotty club.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">He fell not, tho' the force</l>
<l rend="i2">Shattered his skull; nor flowed the blood.</l>
<l rend="i2">For by some hellish talisman</l>
<l rend="i4">His life imprisoned still</l>
<l rend="i0">Dwelt in the body. The astonished crowd</l>
<l rend="i2">Stand motionless with fear, and wait</l>
<l rend="i0">Immediate vengeance from the wrath of Heaven.</l>
<l rend="i2">And lo! the Bird ... the monster Bird</l>
<l rend="i4">Soars up ... then pounces down</l>
<l rend="i4">To seize on Thalaba!</l>
<l rend="i4">Now Oneiza, bend the bow,</l>
<l rend="i4">Now draw the arrow home!</l>
<l rend="i0">It fled, the arrow from Oneiza's hand,</l>
<l rend="i4">It pierced the monster Bird,</l>
<l rend="i4">It broke the Talisman.</l>
<l rend="i4">Then darkness covered all,...</l>
<l rend="i0">Earth shook, Heaven thundered, and amid the yells</l>
<l rend="i4">Of Spirits accursed, destroyed</l>
<l rend="i4">The Paradise<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> of Sin.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">At last the earth was still;</l>
<l rend="i2">The yelling of the Demons ceased;</l>
<l rend="i0">Opening the wreck and ruin to their sight</l>
<l rend="i0">The darkness rolled away. Alone in life</l>
<l rend="i0">Amid the desolation and the dead</l>
<l rend="i0">Stood the Destroyer and the Arabian Maid.</l>
<l rend="i2">They looked around, the rocks were rent,</l>
<l rend="i0">The path was open, late by magic closed.</l>
<l rend="i0">Awe-struck and silent down the stony glen</l>
<l rend="i4">They wound their thoughtful way.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Amid the vale below</l>
<l rend="i4">Tents rose, and streamers played</l>
<l rend="i2">And javelins sparkled in the sun,</l>
<l rend="i4">And multitudes encamped</l>
<l rend="i0">Swarmed, far as eye could follow, o'er the plain.</l>
<l rend="i2">There in his war pavilion sate</l>
<l rend="i4">In council with his Chiefs</l>
<l rend="i4">The Sultan of the Land.</l>
<l rend="i0">Before his presence there a Captain led</l>
<l rend="i2">Oneiza and the appointed Youth.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Obedient to our Lord's command," said he,</l>
<l rend="i0">"We past towards the mountains, and began</l>
<l rend="i0">"The ascending strait; when suddenly Earth shook,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And darkness like the midnight fell around,</l>
<l rend="i2">"And fire and thunder came from Heaven</l>
<l rend="i0">"As tho' the Retribution day were come.</l>
<l rend="i0">"After the terror ceased, and when with hearts</l>
<l rend="i0">"Somewhat assured, again we ventured on,</l>
<l rend="i0">"This youth and woman met us on the way.</l>
<l rend="i0">"They told us that from Aloadin's haunt</l>
<l rend="i0">"They came on whom the judgement-stroke has fallen;</l>
<l rend="i0">"He and his sinful Paradise at once</l>
<l rend="i0">"Destroyed by them, the agents they of Heaven.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Therefore I brought them hither, to repeat</l>
<l rend="i0">"The tale before thy presence; that as search</l>
<l rend="i0">"Shall prove it false or faithful, to their merit</l>
<l rend="i0">"Thou mayest reward them."</l>
<l rend="i11">"Be it done to us,"</l><l rend="i0">Thalaba answered, "as the truth shall prove!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The Sultan while he spake</l>
<l rend="i0">"Fixed on him the proud eye of sovereignty;</l>
<l rend="i4">"If thou hast played with us,</l>
<l rend="i0">"By Allah and by Ali, Death shall seal</l>
<l rend="i0">"The lying lips for ever! if the thing</l>
<l rend="i0">"Be as thou sayest it, Arab, thou shalt stand</l>
<l rend="i2">"Next to ourself!"...</l>
<l rend="i10">And hark! the cry</l><l rend="i2">The lengthening cry, the increasing shout</l>
<l rend="i4">Of joyful multitudes!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Breathless and panting to the tent</l>
<l rend="i2">The bearer of good tidings comes,</l>
<l rend="i0">"O Sultan, live for ever! be thy foes</l>
<l rend="i4">"Like Aloadin all!</l>
<l rend="i2">"The wrath of God hath smitten him."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Joy at the welcome tale</l>
<l rend="i4">Shone in the Sultan's cheek</l>
<l rend="i2">"Array the Arab in the robe</l>
<l rend="i4">"Of honour," he exclaimed,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And place a chain of gold around his neck,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And bind around his brow the diadem,</l>
<l rend="i2">"And mount him on my steed of state,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And lead him thro' the camp,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And let the Heralds go before and cry</l>
<l rend="i4">"Thus shall the Sultan reward</l>
<l rend="i4">"The man<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> who serves him well!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Then in the purple robe</l>
<l rend="i4">They vested Thalaba.</l>
<l rend="i0">And hung around his neck the golden chain,</l>
<l rend="i0">And bound his forehead with the diadem,</l>
<l rend="i4">And on the royal steed</l>
<l rend="i4">They led him thro' the camp,</l>
<l rend="i2">And Heralds went before and cried</l>
<l rend="i4">"Thus shall the Sultan reward</l>
<l rend="i4">"The man who serves him well!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">When from the pomp of triumph</l>
<l rend="i4">And presence of the King</l>
<l rend="i0">Thalaba sought the tent allotted him,</l>
<l rend="i2">Thoughtful the Arabian Maid beheld</l>
<l rend="i4">His animated eye,</l>
<l rend="i4">His cheek inflamed with pride.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Oneiza!" cried the youth,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The King hath done according to his word,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And made me in the land</l>
<l rend="i4">"Next to himself be named!...</l>
<l rend="i0">"But why that serious melancholy smile?</l>
<l rend="i0">"Oneiza when I heard the voice that gave me</l>
<l rend="i0">"Honour, and wealth, and fame, the instant thought</l>
<l rend="i0">"Arose to fill my joy, that thou wouldest hear</l>
<l rend="i0">"The tidings, and be happy."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">ONEIZA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i11">Thalaba</l><l rend="i0">Thou wouldest not have me mirthful! am I not</l>
<l rend="i0">An orphan,... among strangers?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i12">But with me.</l></lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">ONEIZA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">My Father,...</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i6">Nay be comforted! last night</l>
<l rend="i0">To what wert thou exposed! in what a peril</l>
<l rend="i0">The morning found us! safety, honour, wealth</l>
<l rend="i0">These now are ours. This instant who thou wert</l>
<l rend="i0">The Sultan asked. I told him from our childhood</l>
<l rend="i0">We had been plighted;... was I wrong Oneiza?</l>
<l rend="i0">And when he said with bounties he would heap</l>
<l rend="i0">Our nuptials,... wilt thou blame me if I blest</l>
<l rend="i0">His will, that bade me fix the marriage day!</l>
<l rend="i0">In tears Oneiza?...</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">ONEIZA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Remember Destiny</l>
<l rend="i4">Hath marked thee from mankind!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Perhaps when Aloadin was destroyed</l>
<l rend="i0">The mission ceased, else would wise Providence</l>
<l rend="i0">With its rewards and blessings strew my path</l>
<l rend="i0">Thus for accomplished service?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">ONEIZA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i12">Thalaba!</l></lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Or if haply not, yet whither should I go?</l>
<l rend="i0">Is it not prudent to abide in peace</l>
<l rend="i0">Till I am summoned?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">ONEIZA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">Take me to the Deserts!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">But Moath is not there; and wouldest thou dwell</l>
<l rend="i0">In a Stranger's tent? thy father then might seek</l>
<l rend="i0">In long and fruitless wandering for his child.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">ONEIZA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Take me then to Mecca!</l>
<l rend="i0">There let me dwell a servant of the Temple.</l>
<l rend="i0">Bind thou thyself my veil,... to human eye</l>
<l rend="i0">It never shall be lifted. There, whilst thou</l>
<l rend="i0">Shalt go upon thine enterprize, my prayers,</l>
<l rend="i0">Dear Thalaba! shall rise to succour thee,</l>
<l rend="i0">And I shall live,... if not in happiness;</l>
<l rend="i0">Surely in hope.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i6">Oh think of better things!</l>
<l rend="i0">The will of Heaven is plain: by wonderous ways</l>
<l rend="i0">It led us here, and soon the common voice</l>
<l rend="i0">Shall tell what we have done, and how we dwell</l>
<l rend="i0">Under the shadow of the Sultan's wing,</l>
<l rend="i0">So shall thy father hear the fame, and find us</l>
<l rend="i0">What he hath wished us ever.... Still in tears!</l>
<l rend="i0">Still that unwilling eye! nay ... nay.... Oneiza....</l>
<l rend="i0">Has then another since I left the tent....</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">ONEIZA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Thalaba! Thalaba!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">With song, with music, and with dance</l>
<l rend="i4">The bridal pomp proceeds.</l>
<l rend="i4">Following on the veiled Bride</l>
<l rend="i4">Fifty female slaves attend</l>
<l rend="i4">In costly robes that gleam</l>
<l rend="i4">With interwoven gold,</l>
<l rend="i4">And sparkle far with gems.</l>
<l rend="i2">An hundred slaves behind them bear</l>
<l rend="i2">Vessels of silver and vessels of gold</l>
<l rend="i2">And many a gorgeous garment gay</l>
<l rend="i2">The presents that the Sultan gave.</l>
<l rend="i2">On either hand the pages go</l>
<l rend="i2">With torches flaring thro' the gloom,</l>
<l rend="i2">And trump and timbrel merriment</l>
<l rend="i4">Accompanies their way;</l>
<l rend="i2">And multitudes with loud acclaim</l>
<l rend="i4">Shout blessings on the Bride.</l>
<l rend="i2">And now they reach the palace pile,</l>
<l rend="i2">The palace home of Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i2">And now the marriage feast is spread</l>
<l rend="i2">And from the finished banquet now</l>
<l rend="i4">The wedding guests are gone.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Who comes from the bridal chamber?</l>
<l rend="i2">It is Azrael, the Angel of Death.</l></lg>

<l rend="i0">Go not among the Tombs, Old Man!</l>
<l rend="i0">There is a madman there.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">OLD MAN.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Will he harm me if I go?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">WOMAN.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Not he, poor miserable man!</l>
<l rend="i0">But 'tis a wretched sight to see</l>
<l rend="i0">His utter wretchedness.</l>
<l rend="i0">For all day long he lies on a grave,</l>
<l rend="i0">And never is he seen to weep,</l>
<l rend="i0">And never is he heard to groan.</l>
<l rend="i0">Nor ever at the hour of prayer</l>
<l rend="i0">Bends his knee, nor moves his lips.</l>
<l rend="i0">I have taken him food for charity</l>
<l rend="i0">And never a word he spake,</l>
<l rend="i0">But yet so ghastly he looked</l>
<l rend="i0">That I have awakened at night</l>
<l rend="i0">With the dream of his ghastly eyes.</l>
<l rend="i0">Now go not among the Tombs, Old Man!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">OLD MAN.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Wherefore has the wrath of God</l>
<l rend="i0">So sorely stricken him?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">WOMAN.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">He came a Stranger to the land,</l>
<l rend="i0">And did good service to the Sultan,</l>
<l rend="i0">And well his service was rewarded.</l>
<l rend="i0">The Sultan named him next himself,</l>
<l rend="i0">And gave a palace for his dwelling,</l>
<l rend="i0">And dowered his bride with rich domains.</l>
<l rend="i0">But on his wedding night</l>
<l rend="i0">There came the Angel of Death.</l>
<l rend="i0">Since that hour a man distracted</l>
<l rend="i0">Among the sepulchres he wanders.</l>
<l rend="i0">The Sultan when he heard the tale</l>
<l rend="i0">Said that for some untold crime</l>
<l rend="i0">Judgement thus had stricken him,</l>
<l rend="i0">And asking Heaven forgiveness</l>
<l rend="i0">That he had shewn him favour,</l>
<l rend="i0">Abandoned him to want.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">OLD MAN.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">A Stranger did you say?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">WOMAN.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">An Arab born, like you.</l>
<l rend="i0">But go not among the Tombs,</l>
<l rend="i0">For the sight of his wretchedness</l>
<l rend="i0">Might make a hard heart ache!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">OLD MAN.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Nay, nay, I never yet have shunned</l>
<l rend="i0">A countryman in distress:</l>
<l rend="i0">And the sound of his dear native tongue</l>
<l rend="i0">May be like the voice of a friend.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Then to the Sepulchre</l>
<l rend="i2">The Woman pointed out,</l>
<l rend="i2">Old Moath bent his way.</l>
<l rend="i2">By the tomb lay Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i2">In the light of the setting eve.</l>
<l rend="i2">The sun, and the wind, and the rain</l>
<l rend="i2">Had rusted his raven locks,</l>
<l rend="i2">His checks were fallen in,</l>
<l rend="i2">His face bones prominent,</l>
<l rend="i2">By the tomb he lay along</l>
<l rend="i2">And his lean fingers played,</l>
<l rend="i0">Unwitting, with the grass that grew beside.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The Old man knew him not,</l>
<l rend="i4">And drawing near him cried</l>
<l rend="i4">"Countryman, peace be with thee!"</l>
<l rend="i2">The sound of his dear native tongue</l>
<l rend="i4">Awakened Thalaba.</l>
<l rend="i4">He raised his countenance</l>
<l rend="i4">And saw the good Old Man,</l>
<l rend="i0">And he arose, and fell upon his neck,</l>
<l rend="i4">And groaned in bitterness.</l>
<l rend="i4">Then Moath knew the youth,</l>
<l rend="i0">And feared that he was childless, and he turned</l>
<l rend="i2">His eyes, and pointed to the tomb.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Old Man!" cried Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Thy search is ended there!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The father's cheek grew white</l>
<l rend="i0">And his lip quivered with the misery;</l>
<l rend="i0">Howbeit, collecting with a painful voice</l>
<l rend="i0">He answered, "God is good! his will be done!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The woe in which he spake,</l>
<l rend="i0">The resignation that inspired his speech,</l>
<l rend="i4">They softened Thalaba.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Thou hast a solace in thy grief," he cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"A comforter within!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Moath! thou seest me here,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Delivered to the Evil Powers,</l>
<l rend="i4">"A God-abandoned wretch."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">The Old Man looked at him incredulous.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Nightly," the youth pursued,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Thy daughter comes to drive me to despair.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Moath thou thinkest me mad,...</l>
<l rend="i0">"But when the Cryer<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> from the Minaret</l>
<l rend="i4">"Proclaims the midnight hour,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Hast thou a heart to see her?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">In the<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Meidan now</l>
<l rend="i2">The clang of clarions and of drums</l>
<l rend="i2">Accompanied the Sun's descent.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Dost thou not pray? my son!"</l>
<l rend="i4">Said Moath, as he saw</l>
<l rend="i0">The white flag waving on the neighbouring Mosque;</l>
<l rend="i4">Then Thalaba's eye grew wild,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Pray!" echoed he, "I must not pray!"</l>
<l rend="i4">And the hollow groan he gave</l>
<l rend="i4">Went to the Old Man's heart,</l>
<l rend="i2">And bowing down his face to earth,</l>
<l rend="i0">In fervent agony he called on God.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">A night of darkness and of storms!</l>
<l rend="i2">Into the Chamber<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> of the Tomb</l>
<l rend="i4">Thalaba led the Old Man,</l>
<l rend="i4">To roof him from the rain.</l>
<l rend="i4">A night of storms! the wind</l>
<l rend="i4">Swept thro' the moonless sky</l>
<l rend="i0">And moaned among the pillared sepulchres.</l>
<l rend="i2">And in the pauses of its sweep</l>
<l rend="i4">They heard the heavy rain</l>
<l rend="i2">Beat on the monument above.</l>
<l rend="i2">In silence on Oneiza's grave</l>
<l rend="i2">The Father and the Husband sate.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">The Cryer from the Minaret</l>
<l rend="i4">Proclaimed the midnight hour;</l>
<l rend="i4">"Now! now!" cried Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i2">And o'er the chamber of the tomb</l>
<l rend="i4">There spread a lurid gleam</l>
<l rend="i0">Like the reflection of a sulphur fire,</l>
<l rend="i4">And in that hideous light</l>
<l rend="i0">Oneiza stood before them, it was She,</l>
<l rend="i0">Her very lineaments, and such as death</l>
<l rend="i0">Had changed them, livid cheeks, and lips of blue.</l>
<l rend="i4">But in her eyes there dwelt</l>
<l rend="i4">Brightness more terrible</l>
<l rend="i2">Than all the loathsomeness of death.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Still art thou living, wretch?"</l>
<l rend="i0">In hollow tones she cried to Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i2">"And must I nightly leave my grave</l>
<l rend="i4">"To tell thee, still in vain,</l>
<l rend="i4">"God has abandoned thee?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"This is not she!" the Old Man exclaimed,</l>
<l rend="i4">"A Fiend! a manifest Fiend!"</l>
<l rend="i2">And to the youth he held his lance,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Strike and deliver thyself!"</l>
<l rend="i4">"Strike <hi rend="smallcap">her</hi>!" cried Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i4">And palsied of all powers</l>
<l rend="i0">Gazed fixedly upon the dreadful form.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Yea! strike her!" cried a voice whose tones</l>
<l rend="i0">Flowed with such sudden healing thro' his soul,</l>
<l rend="i4">As when the desert shower</l>
<l rend="i4">From death delivered him.</l>
<l rend="i0">But unobedient to that well-known voice</l>
<l rend="i4">His eye was seeking it,</l>
<l rend="i4">When Moath firm of heart,</l>
<l rend="i0">Performed the bidding; thro' the vampire<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> corpse</l>
<l rend="i4">He thrust his lance; it fell,</l>
<l rend="i4">And howling with the wound</l>
<l rend="i4">Its demon tenant fled.</l>
<l rend="i2">A sapphire light fell on them,</l>
<l rend="i0">And garmented with glory, in their sight</l>
<l rend="i4">Oneiza's Spirit stood.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"O Thalaba!" she cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Abandon not thyself!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Wouldst thou for ever lose me?... go, fulfill</l>
<l rend="i0">"Thy quest, that in the Bowers of Paradise</l>
<l rend="i0">"In vain I may not wait thee, O my Husband!"</l>
<l rend="i4">To Moath then the Spirit</l>
<l rend="i0">Turned the dark lustre of her Angel eyes,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Short is thy destined path,</l>
<l rend="i0">"O my dear father! to the abode of bliss.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Return to Araby,</l>
<l rend="i4">"There with the thought of death.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Comfort thy lonely age,</l>
<l rend="i2">"And Azrael the Deliverer, soon</l>
<l rend="i4">"Shall visit thee in peace."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">They stood with earnest eyes</l>
<l rend="i2">And arms out-reaching, when again</l>
<l rend="i4">The darkness closed around them.</l>
<l rend="i2">The soul of Thalaba revived;</l>
<l rend="i2">He from the floor the quiver took</l>
<l rend="i2">And as he bent the bow, exclaimed,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Was it the over-ruling Providence</l>
<l rend="i0">"That in the hour of frenzy led my hands</l>
<l rend="i4">"Instinctively to this?</l>
<l rend="i0">"To-morrow, and the sun shall brace anew</l>
<l rend="i0">"The slackened cord that now sounds loose and damp,</l>
<l rend="i0">"To-morrow, and its livelier tone will sing</l>
<l rend="i0">"In tort vibration to the arrow's flight.</l>
<l rend="i0">"I ... but I also, with recovered health</l>
<l rend="i4">"Of heart, shall do my duty.</l>
<l rend="i0">"My Father! here I leave thee then!" he cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And not to meet again</l>
<l rend="i2">"Till at the gate of Paradise</l>
<l rend="i0">"The eternal union of our joys commence.</l>
<l rend="i0">"We parted last in darkness!"... and the youth</l>
<l rend="i4">Thought with what other hopes,</l>
<l rend="i4">But now his heart was calm,</l>
<l rend="i0">For on his soul a heavenly hope had dawned.</l>
<l rend="i0">The Old Man answered nothing, but he held</l>
<l rend="i4">His garment and to the door</l>
<l rend="i2">Of the Tomb Chamber followed him.</l>
<l rend="i2">The rain had ceased, the sky was wild</l>
<l rend="i2">Its black clouds broken by the storm.</l>
<l rend="i2">And lo! it chanced that in the chasm</l>
<l rend="i4">Of Heaven between, a star,</l>
<l rend="i0">Leaving along its path continuous light,</l>
<l rend="i0">Shot eastward. "See my guide!" quoth Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i4">And turning, he received</l>
<l rend="i4">Old Moath's last embrace,</l>
<l rend="i2">And his last blessing.</l>
<l rend="i10">It was eve,</l><l rend="i0">When an old Dervise, sitting in the sun</l>
<l rend="i0">At his cell door, invited for the night</l>
<l rend="i4">The traveller; in the sun</l>
<l rend="i4">He spread the plain repast</l>
<l rend="i0">Rice and fresh grapes, and at their feet there flowed</l>
<l rend="i4">The brook of which they drank.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">So as they sate at meal,</l>
<l rend="i2">With song, with music, and with dance,</l>
<l rend="i4">A wedding train went by;</l>
<l rend="i2">The veiled bride, the female slaves,</l>
<l rend="i2">The torches of festivity,</l>
<l rend="i2">And trump and timbrel merriment</l>
<l rend="i4">Accompanied their way.</l>
<l rend="i4">The good old Dervise gave</l>
<l rend="i4">A blessing as they past.</l>
<l rend="i4">But Thalaba looked on,</l>
<l rend="i0">And breathed a low, deep groan, and hid his face.</l>
<l rend="i0">The Dervise had known sorrow; and he felt</l>
<l rend="i4">Compassion; and his words</l>
<l rend="i2">Of pity and of piety</l>
<l rend="i4">Opened the young man's heart</l>
<l rend="i4">And he told all his tale.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Repine not, O my Son!" the Old Man replied,</l>
<l rend="i4">"That Heaven has chastened thee.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Behold this vine,<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> I found it a wild tree</l>
<l rend="i2">"Whose wanton strength had swoln into</l>
<l rend="i0">"Irregular twigs, and bold excrescencies,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And spent itself in leaves and little rings,</l>
<l rend="i0">"In the vain flourish of its outwardness</l>
<l rend="i4">"Wasting the sap and strength</l>
<l rend="i4">"That should have given forth fruit.</l>
<l rend="i4">"But when I pruned the Tree,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Then it grew temperate in its vain expence</l>
<l rend="i0">"Of useless leaves, and knotted, as thou seest,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Into these full, clear, clusters, to repay</l>
<l rend="i2">"The hand whose foresight wounded it.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Repine not, O my Son!</l>
<l rend="i0">"In wisdom and in mercy Heaven inflicts,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Like a wise Leech, its painful remedies."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Then pausing, "whither goest thou now?" he asked.</l>
<l rend="i2">"I know not," answered Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Straight on, with Destiny my guide."</l>
<l rend="i0">Quoth the Old Man, "I will not blame thy trust,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And yet methinks thy feet</l>
<l rend="i4">"Should tread with certainty.</l>
<l rend="i0">"In Kaf the Simorg hath his dwelling place,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The all-knowing Bird of Ages, who hath seen</l>
<l rend="i0">"The World, with all her children, thrice destroyed.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Long is the thither path,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And difficult the way, of danger full;</l>
<l rend="i4">"But his unerring voice</l>
<l rend="i0">"Could point to certain end thy weary search."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Easy assent the youth</l>
<l rend="i0">Gave to the words of wisdom; and behold</l>
<l rend="i0">At dawn, the adventurer on his way to Kaf.</l>
<l rend="i2">And he has travelled many a day</l>
<l rend="i2">And many a river swum over,</l>
<l rend="i2">And many a mountain ridge has crost</l>
<l rend="i2">And many a measureless plain,</l>
<l rend="i2">And now amid the wilds advanced,</l>
<l rend="i4">Long is it since his eyes</l>
<l rend="i4">Have seen the trace of man.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Cold! cold! 'tis a chilly clime</l>
<l rend="i2">That the toil of the youth has reached,</l>
<l rend="i2">And he is aweary now,</l>
<l rend="i2">And faint for the lack of food.</l>
<l rend="i2">Cold! cold! there is no Sun in heaven</l>
<l rend="i2">But a heavy and uniform cloud</l>
<l rend="i2">And the snows begin to fall.</l>
<l rend="i0">Dost thou wish for thy deserts, O Son of Hodeirah?</l>
<l rend="i2">Dost thou long for the gales of Arabia?</l>
<l rend="i2">Cold! cold! his blood flows languid,</l>
<l rend="i2">His hands are red, his lips are blue,</l>
<l rend="i2">His feet are sore with the frost.</l>
<l rend="i2">Cheer thee! cheer thee! Thalaba!</l>
<l rend="i4">A little yet bear up!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">All waste! no sign of life</l>
<l rend="i2">But the track of the wolf and the bear!</l>
<l rend="i2">No sound but the wild, wild wind</l>
<l rend="i2">And the snow crunching under his feet!</l>
<l rend="i2">Night is come; no moon, no stars,</l>
<l rend="i2">Only the light of the snow!</l>
<l rend="i2">But behold a fire in the cave of the hill</l>
<l rend="i2">A heart-reviving fire;</l>
<l rend="i2">And thither with strength renewed</l>
<l rend="i2">Thalaba presses on.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">He found a Woman in the cave,</l>
<l rend="i2">A solitary Woman,</l>
<l rend="i2">Who by the fire was spinning</l>
<l rend="i2">And singing as she spun.</l>
<l rend="i2">The pine boughs they blazed chearfully</l>
<l rend="i2">And her face was bright with the flame.</l>
<l rend="i2">Her face was as a Damsel's face</l>
<l rend="i2">And yet her hair was grey.</l>
<l rend="i2">She bade him welcome with a smile</l>
<l rend="i2">And still continued spinning</l>
<l rend="i2">And singing as she spun.</l>
<l rend="i2">The thread the Woman drew</l>
<l rend="i2">Was finer than the silkworm's,</l>
<l rend="i2">Was finer than the gossamer.</l>
<l rend="i2">The song she sung was low and sweet</l>
<l rend="i2">And Thalaba knew not the words.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">He laid his bow before the hearth,</l>
<l rend="i2">For the string was frozen stiff.</l>
<l rend="i2">He took the quiver from his neck,</l>
<l rend="i2">For the arrow plumes were iced.</l>
<l rend="i2">Then as the chearful fire</l>
<l rend="i2">Revived his languid limbs,</l>
<l rend="i2">The adventurer asked for food.</l>
<l rend="i2">The Woman answered him,</l>
<l rend="i2">And still her speech was song,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The She Bear she dwells near to me,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And she hath cubs, one, two and three.</l>
<l rend="i0">"She hunts the deer and brings him here,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And then with her I make good cheer,</l>
<l rend="i4">"And she to the chase is gone</l>
<l rend="i4">"And she will be here anon."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">She ceased from her work as she spake,</l>
<l rend="i2">And when she had answered him,</l>
<l rend="i2">Again her fingers twirled the thread</l>
<l rend="i2">And again the Woman began</l>
<l rend="i2">In low, sweet, tones to sing</l>
<l rend="i2">The unintelligible song.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">The thread she spun it gleamed like gold</l>
<l rend="i2">In the light of the odorous fire,</l>
<l rend="i2">And yet so wonderous thin,</l>
<l rend="i2">That save when the light shone on it</l>
<l rend="i2">It could not be seen by the eye.</l>
<l rend="i2">The youth sate watching it,</l>
<l rend="i2">And she beheld his wonder.</l>
<l rend="i2">And then again she spake to him</l>
<l rend="i2">And still her speech was song,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Now twine it round thy hands I say,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Now twine it round thy hands I pray,</l>
<l rend="i0">"My thread is small, my thread is fine,</l>
<l rend="i4">"But he must be</l>
<l rend="i4">"A stronger than thee,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Who can break this thread of mine!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">And up she raised her bright blue eyes</l>
<l rend="i2">And sweetly she smiled on him,</l>
<l rend="i2">And he conceived no ill.</l>
<l rend="i2">And round and round his right hand,</l>
<l rend="i2">And round and round his left,</l>
<l rend="i2">He wound the thread so fine.</l>
<l rend="i2">And then again the Woman spake,</l>
<l rend="i2">And still her speech was song,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Now thy strength, O Stranger, strain,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Now then break the slender chain."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Thalaba strove, but the thread</l>
<l rend="i2">Was woven by magic hands,</l>
<l rend="i2">And in his cheek the flush of shame</l>
<l rend="i2">Arose, commixt with fear.</l>
<l rend="i2">She beheld and laughed at him,</l>
<l rend="i2">And then again she sung,</l>
<l rend="i0">"My thread is small, my thread is fine,</l>
<l rend="i4">"But he must be</l>
<l rend="i4">"A stronger than thee</l>
<l rend="i0">"Who can break this thread of mine."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">And up she raised her bright blue eyes</l>
<l rend="i2">And fiercely she smiled on him,</l>
<l rend="i0">"I thank thee, I thank thee, Hodeirah's Son!</l>
<l rend="i0">"I thank thee for doing what can't be undone,</l>
<l rend="i0">"For binding thyself in the chain I have spun!"</l>
<l rend="i2">Then from his head she wrenched</l>
<l rend="i2">A lock of his raven hair,</l>
<l rend="i2">And cast it in the fire</l>
<l rend="i2">And cried aloud as it burnt,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Sister! Sister! hear my voice!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Sister! Sister! come and rejoice,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The web is spun,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The prize is won,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The work is done,</l>
<l rend="i0">"For I have made captive Hoderiah's Son."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Borne in her magic car</l>
<l rend="i4">The Sister Sorceress came,</l>
<l rend="i0">Khawla, the fiercest of the Sorcerer brood.</l>
<l rend="i4">She gazed upon the youth,</l>
<l rend="i2">She bade him break the slender thread,</l>
<l rend="i4">She laughed aloud for scorn,</l>
<l rend="i4">She clapt her hands for joy.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">The She Bear from the chase came in,</l>
<l rend="i2">She bore the prey in her bloody mouth,</l>
<l rend="i0">She laid it at Maimuna's feet,</l>
<l rend="i0">And she looked up with wistful eyes</l>
<l rend="i2">As if to ask her share.</l>
<l rend="i2">"There! there!" quoth Maimuna</l>
<l rend="i0">And pointing to the prisoner youth</l>
<l rend="i2">She spurned him with her foot,</l>
<l rend="i2">And bade her make her meal.</l>
<l rend="i0">But soon their mockery failed them</l>
<l rend="i0">And anger and shame arose,</l>
<l rend="i0">For the She Bear fawned on Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i0">And quietly licked his hand.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">The grey haired Sorceress stamped the ground</l>
<l rend="i2">And called a Spirit up,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Shall we bear the Enemy</l>
<l rend="i0">"To the dungeon dens below?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">SPIRIT.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Woe! woe! to our Empire woe!</l>
<l rend="i0">If ever he tread the caverns below.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">MAIMUNA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Shall we leave him fettered here</l>
<l rend="i0">With hunger and cold to die?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">SPIRIT.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Away from thy lonely dwelling fly!</l>
<l rend="i0">Here I see a danger nigh</l>
<l rend="i0">That he should live and thou shouldst die.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">MAIMUNA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Whither must we bear the foe?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">SPIRIT.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">To Mohareb's island go,</l>
<l rend="i0">There shalt thou secure the foe,</l>
<l rend="i0">There prevent thy future woe.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Then in the Car they threw</l>
<l rend="i2">The fettered Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i2">And took their seats, and set</l>
<l rend="i2">Their feet upon his neck,</l>
<l rend="i2">Maimuna held the reins</l>
<l rend="i2">And Khawla shook the scourge</l>
<l rend="i2">And away!<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> away! away!</l>
<l rend="i2">They were no steeds of mortal race</l>
<l rend="i4">That drew the magic car</l>
<l rend="i2">With the swiftness of feet and of wings.</l>
<l rend="i2">The snow-dust rises behind them,</l>
<l rend="i2">The ice-rocks splinters fly,</l>
<l rend="i2">And hark! in the valley below</l>
<l rend="i2">The sound of their chariot wheels</l>
<l rend="i2">And they are far over the mountains.</l>
<l rend="i4">Away! away! away!</l>
<l rend="i4">The Demons of the air</l>
<l rend="i2">Shout their joy as the Sisters pass,</l>
<l rend="i0">The Ghosts of the Wicked that wander by night</l>
<l rend="i2">Flit over the magic car.</l>
<l rend="i4">Away! away! away!</l>
<l rend="i4">Over the hills and the plains</l>
<l rend="i4">Over the rivers and rocks,</l>
<l rend="i4">Over the sands of the shore;</l>
<l rend="i4">The waves of ocean heave</l>
<l rend="i4">Under the magic steeds,</l>
<l rend="i2">With unwet hoofs they trample the deep</l>
<l rend="i2">And now they reach the Island coast,</l>
<l rend="i0">And away to the city the Monarch's abode.</l>
<l rend="i4">Open fly the city gates,</l>
<l rend="i4">Open fly the iron doors</l>
<l rend="i4">The doors of the palace court.</l>
<l rend="i4">Then stopt the charmed car.</l>
<l rend="i2">The Monarch heard the chariot wheels</l>
<l rend="i4">And forth he came to greet</l>
<l rend="i4">The Mistress whom he served.</l>
<l rend="i4">He knew the captive youth,</l>
<l rend="i4">And Thalaba beheld</l>
<l rend="i0">Mohareb in<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> the robes of royalty,</l>

<div type="book"><head>THE NINTH BOOK.</head><lg>
<l rend="i2">"Go up, my Sister Maimuna,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Go up, and read the stars!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Lo! on the terrace of the topmost tower</l>
<l rend="i4">She stands; her darkening eyes,</l>
<l rend="i4">Her fine face raised to heaven,</l>
<l rend="i0">Her white hair flowing like the silver streams</l>
<l rend="i4">That streak the northern night.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">They hear her coming tread,</l>
<l rend="i4">They lift their asking eyes,</l>
<l rend="i0">Her face is serious, her unwilling lips</l>
<l rend="i4">Slow to the tale of ill.</l>
<l rend="i2">"What hast thou read? what hast thou read?"</l>
<l rend="i4">Quoth Khawla in alarm.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Danger ... death ... judgement!" Maimuna replied.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Is that the language of the lights of Heaven?"</l>
<l rend="i4">Exclaimed the sterner Witch.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Creatures of Allah, they perform his will.</l>
<l rend="i0">"And with their lying menaces would daunt</l>
<l rend="i2">"Our credulous folly.... Maimuna,</l>
<l rend="i0">"I never liked this uncongenial lore!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Better befits to make the sacrifice</l>
<l rend="i2">"Of Divination; so shall I</l>
<l rend="i4">"Be mine own Oracle.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Command the victims thou, O King!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Male and female they must be,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Thou knowest the needful rites.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Meanwhile I purify the place."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">The Sultan went; the Sorceress rose,</l>
<l rend="i0">And North and South and East and West</l>
<l rend="i2">She faced the points of Heaven,</l>
<l rend="i2">And ever where she turned</l>
<l rend="i0">She laid her hand upon the wall,</l>
<l rend="i0">And up she looked and smote the air,</l>
<l rend="i0">And down she stooped and smote the floor,</l>
<l rend="i2">"To Eblis and his servants</l>
<l rend="i2">"I consecrate the place,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Let none intrude but they!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Whatever hath the breath of life,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Whatever hath the sap of life,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Let it be blasted and die!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Now all is prepared;</l>
<l rend="i4">Mohareb returns,</l>
<l rend="i4">The Circle is drawn,</l>
<l rend="i4">The Victims have bled,</l>
<l rend="i4">The Youth and the Maid.</l>
<l rend="i0">She in the circle holds in either hand</l>
<l rend="i2">Clenched by the hair, a head,</l>
<l rend="i0">The heads of the Youth and the Maid.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Go out ye lights!" quoth Khawla,</l>
<l rend="i0">And in darkness began the spell.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">With spreading arms she whirls around</l>
<l rend="i2">Rapidly, rapidly</l>
<l rend="i2">Ever around and around;</l>
<l rend="i0">And loudly she calls the while</l>
<l rend="i4">"Eblis! Eblis!"</l>
<l rend="i2">Loudly, incessantly,</l>
<l rend="i0">Still she calls "Eblis! Eblis!"</l>
<l rend="i0">Giddily, giddily, still she whirls,</l>
<l rend="i0">Loudly, incessantly, still she calls;</l>
<l rend="i0">The motion is ever the same,</l>
<l rend="i2">Ever around and around;</l>
<l rend="i0">The calling is still the same</l>
<l rend="i2">Still it is "Eblis! Eblis!"</l>
<l rend="i0">And her voice is a shapeless yell,</l>
<l rend="i0">And dizzily rolls her brain,</l>
<l rend="i2">And now she is full of the Fiend.</l>
<l rend="i4">She stops, she rocks, she reels!</l>
<l rend="i2">Look! look! she appears in the darkness!</l>
<l rend="i4">Her flamy hairs curl up</l>
<l rend="i0">All living, like the Meteor's locks of light!</l>
<l rend="i2">Her eyes are like the sickly Moon!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">It is her lips that move,</l>
<l rend="i4">Her tongue that shapes the sound,</l>
<l rend="i2">But whose is the Voice that proceeds?</l>
<l rend="i4">"Ye may hope and ye may fear,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The danger of his stars is near.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Sultan! if he perish, woe!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Fate has written one death-blow</l>
<l rend="i4">"For Mohareb and the Foe?</l>
<l rend="i4">"Triumph! triumph! only she</l>
<l rend="i4">"That knit his bonds can set him free."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">She spake the Oracle,</l>
<l rend="i4">And senselessly she fell.</l>
<l rend="i2">They knelt in care beside her,</l>
<l rend="i4">Her Sister and the King.</l>
<l rend="i2">They sprinkled her palms with water,</l>
<l rend="i2">They wetted her nostrils with blood.</l>
<l rend="i4">She wakes as from a dream,</l>
<l rend="i4">She asks the uttered Voice,</l>
<l rend="i0">But when she heard, an anger and a grief</l>
<l rend="i4">Darkened her wrinkling brow.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Then let him live in long captivity!"</l>
<l rend="i0">She answered: but Mohareb's quickened eye</l>
<l rend="i2">Perused her sullen countenance</l>
<l rend="i4">That lied not with the lips.</l>
<l rend="i4">A miserable man!</l>
<l rend="i2">What boots it, that, in central caves</l>
<l rend="i0">The Powers of Evil at his Baptism pledged</l>
<l rend="i4">The Sacrament of Hell?</l>
<l rend="i4">His death secures them now.</l>
<l rend="i4">What boots it that they gave</l>
<l rend="i4">Abdaldar's guardian ring,</l>
<l rend="i4">When thro' another's life</l>
<l rend="i4">The blow may reach his own?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">He sought the dungeon cell</l>
<l rend="i4">Where Thalaba was laid.</l>
<l rend="i0">'Twas the grey morning twilight, and the voice</l>
<l rend="i4">Of Thalaba in prayer,</l>
<l rend="i2">With words of hallowed import, smote</l>
<l rend="i4">The King's alarmed sense.</l>
<l rend="i2">The grating of the heavy hinge</l>
<l rend="i4">Roused not the Arabian youth;</l>
<l rend="i2">Nor lifted he his earthward face</l>
<l rend="i4">At sound of coming feet.</l>
<l rend="i0">Nor did Mohareb with unholy voice</l>
<l rend="i0">Disturb the duty: silent, spirit-awed,</l>
<l rend="i2">Envious, heart-humbled, he beheld</l>
<l rend="i2">The dungeon-peace of piety</l>
<l rend="i0">Till Thalaba, the perfect rite performed,</l>
<l rend="i0">Raised his calm eye; then spake the Island-Chief.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Arab! my guidance thro' the dangerous Cave,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Thy service overpaid,</l>
<l rend="i0">"An unintended friend in enmity.</l>
<l rend="i4">"The hand that caught thy ring</l>
<l rend="i0">"Received and bore me to the scene I sought.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Now know me grateful. I return</l>
<l rend="i0">"That amulet, thy only safety here."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Artful he spake, with show of gratitude</l>
<l rend="i4">Veiling the selfish deed.</l>
<l rend="i4">Locked in the magic chain</l>
<l rend="i2">The powerless hand of Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i4">Received again the Spell.</l>
<l rend="i0">Remembering then with what an ominous faith</l>
<l rend="i4">First he drew on the gem,</l>
<l rend="i0">The Youth repeats his words of augury;</l>
<l rend="i0">"In God's name and the Prophet's! be its power</l>
<l rend="i0">"Good, let it serve the holy! if for evil</l>
<l rend="i2">"God and my faith shall hallow it.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Blindly the wicked work</l>
<l rend="i4">"The righteous will of Heaven!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">So Thalaba received again</l>
<l rend="i4">The written ring of gold.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Thoughtful awhile Mohareb stood</l>
<l rend="i4">And eyed the captive youth.</l>
<l rend="i0">Then, building skilfully the sophist speech,</l>
<l rend="i0">Thus he began. "Brave art thou, Thalaba!</l>
<l rend="i0">"And wherefore are we foes!... for I would buy</l>
<l rend="i0">"Thy friendship at a princely price, and make thee</l>
<l rend="i4">"To thine own welfare wise.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Hear me! in Nature are two hostile Gods,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Makers and Masters of existing things,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Equal in power:... nay hear me patiently!...</l>
<l rend="i0">"Equal ... for look around thee! the same Earth</l>
<l rend="i0">"Bears fruit and poison; where the Camel finds</l>
<l rend="i0">"His fragrant<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> food, the horned Viper there</l>
<l rend="i0">"Sucks in the juice of death; the Elements</l>
<l rend="i0">"Now serve the use of man, and now assert</l>
<l rend="i0">"Dominion o'er his weakness; dost thou hear</l>
<l rend="i0">"The sound of merriment and nuptial song?</l>
<l rend="i0">"From the next house proceeds the mourner's cry</l>
<l rend="i0">"Lamenting o'er the dead. Sayest thou that Sin</l>
<l rend="i0">"Entered the world of Allah? that the Fiend</l>
<l rend="i0">"Permitted for a season, prowls for prey?</l>
<l rend="i0">"When to thy tent the venomous serpent creeps</l>
<l rend="i0">"Dost thou not crush the reptile? even so,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Besure, had Allah crushed his Enemy,</l>
<l rend="i0">"But that the power was wanting. From the first,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Eternal as themselves their warfare is,</l>
<l rend="i0">"To the end it must endure. Evil and Good....</l>
<l rend="i0">"What are they Thalaba but words? in the strife</l>
<l rend="i0">"Of Angels, as of men, the weak are guilty;</l>
<l rend="i0">"Power must decide. The Spirits of the Dead</l>
<l rend="i0">"Quitting their mortal mansion, enter not,</l>
<l rend="i0">"As falsely ye are preached, their final seat</l>
<l rend="i0">"Of bliss, or bale; nor in the sepulchre</l>
<l rend="i0">"Sleep they the long long sleep: each joins the host</l>
<l rend="i0">"Of his great Leader, aiding in the war</l>
<l rend="i4">"Whose fate involves his own.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Woe to the vanquished then!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Woe to the sons of man who followed him!</l>
<l rend="i0">"They with their Leader, thro' eternity,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Must howl in central fires.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Thou Thalaba hast chosen ill thy part,</l>
<l rend="i0">"If choice it may be called, where will was not,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Nor searching doubt, nor judgement wise to weigh.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Hard is the service of the Power beneath</l>
<l rend="i0">"Whose banners thou wert born; his discipline</l>
<l rend="i0">"Severe, yea cruel; and his wages, rich</l>
<l rend="i0">"Only in promise; who has seen the pay?</l>
<l rend="i0">"For us ... the pleasures of the world are ours,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Riches and rule, the kingdoms of the Earth.</l>
<l rend="i0">"We met in Babylon adventurers both,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Each zealous for the hostile Power he served:</l>
<l rend="i0">"We meet again; thou feelest what thou art,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Thou seest what I am, the Sultan here,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Lord of Life and Death.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Abandon him who has abandoned thee,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And be as I am, great among mankind!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">The Captive did not, hasty to confute</l>
<l rend="i4">Break of that subtle speech,</l>
<l rend="i0">But when the expectant silence of the King</l>
<l rend="i0">Looked for his answer, then spake Thalaba.</l>
<l rend="i0">"And this then is thy faith! this monstrous creed!</l>
<l rend="i0">"This lie against the Sun and Moon and Stars</l>
<l rend="i0">"And Earth and Heaven! blind man who canst not see</l>
<l rend="i0">"How all things work the best! who wilt not know</l>
<l rend="i0">"That in the Manhood of the World, whate'er</l>
<l rend="i0">"Of folly marked its Infancy, of vice</l>
<l rend="i0">"Sullied its Youth, ripe Wisdom shall cast off,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Stablished in good, and knowing evil safe.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Sultan Mohareb, yes, ye have me here</l>
<l rend="i0">"In chains; but not forsaken, tho' opprest:</l>
<l rend="i0">"Cast down, but not destroyed. Shall danger daunt,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Shall death dismay his soul, whose life is given</l>
<l rend="i0">"For God and for his brethren of mankind?</l>
<l rend="i0">"Alike rewarded, in that noble cause,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The Conquerors and the Martyrs palm above</l>
<l rend="i0">"Beam with one glory. Hope ye that my blood</l>
<l rend="i0">"Can quench the dreaded flame? and know ye not</l>
<l rend="i0">"That leagued against you are the Just and Wise,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And all Good Actions of all ages past,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Yea your own Crimes, and Truth, and God in Heaven!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"Slave!" quoth Mohareb, and his lips</l>
<l rend="i4">Quivered with eager wrath.</l>
<l rend="i2">"I have thee! thou shalt feel my power,</l>
<l rend="i2">"And in thy dungeon loathsomeness</l>
<l rend="i4">"Rot piece-meal, limb from limb!"</l>
<l rend="i4">And out the Tyrant rushes,</l>
<l rend="i2">And all impatient of the thoughts</l>
<l rend="i4">That cankered in his heart,</l>
<l rend="i0">Seeks in the giddiness of boisterous sport</l>
<l rend="i0">Short respite from the avenging power within.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">What Woman is she</l>
<l rend="i4">So wrinkled and old,</l>
<l rend="i4">That goes to the wood?</l>
<l rend="i4">She leans on her staff</l>
<l rend="i4">With a tottering step,</l>
<l rend="i2">She tells her bead-strings slow</l>
<l rend="i2">Thro' fingers dulled by age.</l>
<l rend="i2">The wanton boys bemock her.</l>
<l rend="i2">The babe in arms that meets her</l>
<l rend="i2">Turns round with quick affright</l>
<l rend="i2">And clings to his nurse's neck.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Hark! hark! the hunter's cry</l>
<l rend="i2">Mohareb gone to the chase!</l>
<l rend="i4">The dogs with eager yell</l>
<l rend="i4">Are struggling to be free;</l>
<l rend="i4">The hawks in frequent stoop</l>
<l rend="i4">Token their haste for flight;</l>
<l rend="i2">And couchant on the saddle-bow,</l>
<l rend="i2">With tranquil eyes and talons sheathed</l>
<l rend="i2">The ounce expects his liberty.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Propt on the staff that shakes</l>
<l rend="i4">Beneath her trembling weight,</l>
<l rend="i4">The Old Woman sees them pass.</l>
<l rend="i6">Halloa! halloa!</l>
<l rend="i6">The game is up!</l>
<l rend="i6">The dogs are loosed</l>
<l rend="i2">The deer bounds over the plain,</l>
<l rend="i4">The lagging dogs behind</l>
<l rend="i6">Follow from afar!</l>
<l rend="i2">But lo! the Falcon o'er his head.</l>
<l rend="i4">Hovers with hostile<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> wings,</l>
<l rend="i2">And buffets him with blinding strokes!</l>
<l rend="i2">Dizzy with the deafening strokes</l>
<l rend="i2">In blind and interrupted course,</l>
<l rend="i4">Poor beast be struggles on;</l>
<l rend="i4">And now the dogs are nigh!</l>
<l rend="i4">How his heart pants! you see</l>
<l rend="i4">The panting of his heart;</l>
<l rend="i4">And tears like human tears</l>
<l rend="i0">Roll down, along the big veins, fever-swoln;</l>
<l rend="i0">And now the death-sweat<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> darkens his dun hide!</l>
<l rend="i0">His fear, his groans, his agony, his death,</l>

</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Halloa! another prey,</l>
<l rend="i4">The nimble Antelope!</l>
<l rend="i4">The Ounce<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> is freed; one spring</l>
<l rend="i0">And his talons are sheathed in her shoulders,</l>
<l rend="i2">And his teeth are red in her gore.</l>
<l rend="i2">There came a sound from the wood,</l>
<l rend="i0">Like the howl of the winter wind at night</l>
<l rend="i4">Around a lonely dwelling,</l>
<l rend="i2">The Ounce whose gums were warm in his prey</l>
<l rend="i4">He hears the summoning sound.</l>
<l rend="i4">In vain his master's voice</l>
<l rend="i4">No longer dreaded now,</l>
<l rend="i2">Calls and recalls with threatful tone.</l>
<l rend="i4">Away to the forest he goes,</l>
<l rend="i4">For that Old Woman had laid</l>
<l rend="i0">Her shrivelled finger on her shrivelled lips,</l>
<l rend="i2">And whistled with a long, long breath,</l>
<l rend="i4">And that long breath was the sound</l>
<l rend="i0">Like the howl of the winter wind at night</l>
<l rend="i4">Around a lonely dwelling.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Mohareb knew her not,</l>
<l rend="i4">As to the chase he went,</l>
<l rend="i4">The glance of his proud eye</l>
<l rend="i0">Passing in scorn o'er age and wretchedness.</l>
<l rend="i2">She stands in the depth of the wood,</l>
<l rend="i4">And panting to her feet</l>
<l rend="i0">Fawning and fearful creeps the charmed ounce.</l>
<l rend="i0">Well mayst thou fear, and vainly dost thou fawn!</l>
<l rend="i2">Her form is changed, her visage new,</l>
<l rend="i4">Her power, her heart the same!</l>
<l rend="i2">It is Khawla that stands in the wood.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">She knew the place where the mandrake grew,</l>
<l rend="i4">And round the neck of the ounce,</l>
<l rend="i4">And round the mandrake's head</l>
<l rend="i2">She tightens the ends of her cord.</l>
<l rend="i4">Her ears are closed with wax,</l>
<l rend="i2">And her prest finger fastens them,</l>
<l rend="i0">Deaf as the Adder, when with grounded head</l>
<l rend="i0">And circled form, her avenues of sound</l>
<l rend="i4">Barred safely, one slant eye</l>
<l rend="i4">Watches the charmer's lips</l>
<l rend="i0">Waste on the wind his<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> baffled witchery.</l>
<l rend="i2">The spotted ounce so beautiful</l>
<l rend="i4">Springs forceful from the scourge:</l>
<l rend="i2">The dying plant all agony,</l>
<l rend="i4">Feeling its life-strings crack,</l>
<l rend="i0">Uttered the unimaginable groan</l>
<l rend="i4">That none can hear and live.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Then from her victim servant Khawla loosed</l>
<l rend="i0">The precious poison, next with naked hand</l>
<l rend="i2">She plucked the boughs of the manchineel.</l>
<l rend="i2">Then of the wormy wax she took,</l>
<l rend="i0">That from the perforated<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> tree forced out,</l>
<l rend="i0">Bewrayed its insect-parent's work within.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">In a cavern of the wood she sits</l>
<l rend="i2">And moulds the wax to human form,</l>
<l rend="i2">And as her fingers kneaded it,</l>
<l rend="i0">By magic accents, to the mystic shape</l>
<l rend="i0">Imparted with the life of Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i4">In all its passive powers</l>
<l rend="i4">Mysterious sympathy.</l>
<l rend="i2">With the Mandrake and the Manchineel</l>
<l rend="i4">She builds her pile accurst.</l>
<l rend="i2">She lays her finger to the pile,</l>
<l rend="i4">And blue and green, the flesh</l>
<l rend="i4">Glows with emitted fire,</l>
<l rend="i0">A fire<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> to kindle that strange fuel meet.</l>
<l rend="i0">Before the fire she placed the imaged wax,</l>
<l rend="i2">"There<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> waste away!" the Enchantress cried,</l>
<l rend="i2">"And with thee waste Hodeirah's Son!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Fool! fool! go thaw the everlasting ice,</l>
<l rend="i0">Whose polar mountains bound the human reign.</l>
<l rend="i4">Blindly the wicked work</l>
<l rend="i4">The righteous will of Heaven!</l>
<l rend="i0">The doomed Destroyer wears Abdaldar's ring!</l>
<l rend="i0">Against the danger of his horoscope</l>
<l rend="i4">Yourselves have shielded him!</l>
<l rend="i2">And on the sympathizing wax</l>
<l rend="i0">The unadmitted flames play powerlessly,</l>
<l rend="i0">As the cold moon-beam on a plain of snow.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Curse thee! curse thee!" cried the fiendly woman,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Hast thou yet a spell of safety?"</l>
<l rend="i4">And in the raging flames</l>
<l rend="i4">She cast the imaged wax.</l>
<l rend="i4">It lay amid the flames,</l>
<l rend="i4">Like Polycarp of old,</l>
<l rend="i0">When by the glories of the burning stake</l>
<l rend="i4">O'er vaulted, his grey hairs</l>
<l rend="i4">Curled, life-like, to the fire</l>
<l rend="i2">That haloed round his saintly brow.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Wherefore is this!" cried Khawla, and she stamped</l>
<l rend="i4">Thrice on the cavern floor,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Maimuna! Maimuna!"</l>
<l rend="i4">Thrice on the floor she stamped,</l>
<l rend="i2">Then to the rocky gateway glanced</l>
<l rend="i0">Her eager eyes, and Maimuna was there.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Nay Sister, nay!" quoth she, "Mohareb's life</l>
<l rend="i4">"Is linked with Thalaba's!</l>
<l rend="i2">"Nay Sister, nay! the plighted oath!</l>
<l rend="i4">"The common Sacrament!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Idiot!" said Khawla, "one must die, or all!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Faith kept with him were treason to the rest.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Why lies the wax, like marble, in the fire?</l>
<l rend="i4">"What powerful amulet</l>
<l rend="i4">"Protects Hodeirah's son?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Cold, marble-cold, the wax</l>
<l rend="i4">Lay on the raging pile,</l>
<l rend="i0">Cold in that white intensity of fire.</l>
<l rend="i0">The Bat that with her hooked and leathery wings</l>
<l rend="i2">Clung to the cave-roof, loosed her hold,</l>
<l rend="i4">Death-sickening with the heat;</l>
<l rend="i0">The Toad who to the darkest nook had crawled</l>
<l rend="i4">Panted fast with fever pain;</l>
<l rend="i2">The Viper from her nest came forth</l>
<l rend="i4">Leading her quickened brood,</l>
<l rend="i0">Who sportive with the warm delight, rolled out</l>
<l rend="i0">Their thin curls, tender as the tendril rings,</l>
<l rend="i0">Ere the green beauty of their brittle youth</l>
<l rend="i0">Grows brown, and toughens in the summer sun.</l>
<l rend="i4">Cold, marble-cold, the wax</l>
<l rend="i4">Lay on the raging pile,</l>
<l rend="i0">The silver quivering of the element</l>
<l rend="i0">O'er its pale surface shedding a dim gloss.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Amid the red and fiery smoke,</l>
<l rend="i4">Watching the strange portent,</l>
<l rend="i0">The blue-eyed Sorceress and her Sister stood,</l>
<l rend="i0">Seeming a ruined Angel by the side</l>
<l rend="i4">Of Spirit born in Hell.</l>
<l rend="i0">At length raised Maimuna her thoughtful eyes,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Whence Sister was the wax</l>
<l rend="i2">"The work of the worm, or the bee?</l>
<l rend="i4">"Nay then I marvel not!</l>
<l rend="i0">"It were as wise to bring from Ararat</l>
<l rend="i0">"The fore-world's<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> wood to build the magic pile,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And feed it from the balm bower, thro' whose veins</l>
<l rend="i0">"The Martyr's blood sends such a virtue out,</l>
<l rend="i0">"That the fond Mother from beneath its shade</l>
<l rend="i0">"Wreathes the Cerastes<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> round her playful child.</l>
<l rend="i0">"This the eternal, universal strife!</l>
<l rend="i0">"There is a grave-wax,<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>... I have seen the Gouls</l>
<l rend="i0">"Fight for the dainty at their banquetting."...</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Excellent witch!" quoth Khawla; and she went</l>
<l rend="i0">To the cave arch of entrance, and scowled up,</l>
<l rend="i4">Mocking the blessed Sun,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Shine thou in Heaven, but I will shadow Earth!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Thou wilt not shorten day,</l>
<l rend="i0">"But I will hasten darkness!" Then the Witch</l>
<l rend="i4">Began a magic song,</l>
<l rend="i2">One long low tone thro' teeth half-closed,</l>
<l rend="i2">Thro' lips slow-moving muttered slow,</l>
<l rend="i4">One long-continued breath,</l>
<l rend="i0">Till to her eyes a darker yellowness</l>
<l rend="i0">Was driven, and fuller swoln the prominent veins</l>
<l rend="i4">On her loose throat grew black.</l>
<l rend="i2">Then looking upward thrice she breathed</l>
<l rend="i4">Into the face of Heaven,</l>
<l rend="i2">The baneful breath infected Heaven;</l>
<l rend="i4">A mildewing mist it spread</l>
<l rend="i0">Darker and darker; so the evening sun</l>
<l rend="i0">Poured his unentering glory on the mist,</l>
<l rend="i4">And it was night below.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Bring now the wax," quoth Khawla, "for thou knowest</l>
<l rend="i0">"The mine that yields it!" forth went Maimuna,</l>
<l rend="i0">In mist and darkness went the Sorceress forth.</l>
<l rend="i2">And she has reached the place of Tombs,</l>
<l rend="i2">And in their sepulchres the dead</l>
<l rend="i0">Feel<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> feet unholy trampling over them.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Thou startest Maimuna,</l>
<l rend="i0">Because the breeze is in thy lilted locks!</l>
<l rend="i4">Is Khawla's spell so weak?</l>
<l rend="i2">Sudden came the breeze and strong;</l>
<l rend="i0">The mist that in the labouring lungs was felt</l>
<l rend="i0">So heavy late, flies now before the gale,</l>
<l rend="i4">Thin as an Infant's breath</l>
<l rend="i0">Seen in the sunshine of an autumn frost.</l>
<l rend="i0">Sudden it came and soon its work was done,</l>
<l rend="i4">And suddenly it ceased;</l>
<l rend="i0">Cloudless and calm it left the firmament,</l>
<l rend="i2">And beautiful in the blue sky</l>
<l rend="i4">Arose the summer Moon.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">She heard the quickened action of her blood,</l>
<l rend="i2">She felt the fever in her cheeks.</l>
<l rend="i2">Daunted, yet desperate, in a tomb</l>
<l rend="i2">Entering, with impious hand she traced</l>
<l rend="i4">Circles, and squares, and trines,</l>
<l rend="i4">And magic characters,</l>
<l rend="i2">Till riven by her charms the grave</l>
<l rend="i4">Yawned and disclosed its dead,</l>
<l rend="i0">Maimuna's eyes were opened, and she saw</l>
<l rend="i4">The secrets of the grave.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">There sate a Spirit in the vault,</l>
<l rend="i0">In shape, in hue, in lineaments like life,</l>
<l rend="i2">And by him couched, as if intranced,</l>
<l rend="i0">The hundred-headed Worm that never dies.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Nay Sorceress! not to-night!" the Spirit cried,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The flesh in which I sinned may rest to-night</l>
<l rend="i0">"From suffering; all things, even I to-night,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Even the Damned repose!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The flesh of Maimuna</l>
<l rend="i0">Crept on her bones with terror, and her knees</l>
<l rend="i2">Trembled with their trembling weight.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Only this sabbath! and at dawn the Worm</l>
<l rend="i0">"Will wake, and this poor flesh must grow to meet</l>
<l rend="i0">"The gnawing of his hundred<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> poison-mouths!</l>
<l rend="i0">"God! God! Is there no mercy after death?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Soul-struck she rushed away,</l>
<l rend="i4">She fled the place of Tombs,</l>
<l rend="i2">She cast herself upon the earth,</l>
<l rend="i0">All agony and tumult and despair.</l>
<l rend="i0">And in that wild and desperate agony</l>
<l rend="i0">Sure Maimuna had died the utter death,</l>
<l rend="i0">If aught of evil had been possible</l>
<l rend="i4">On this mysterious night;</l>
<l rend="i2">For this was that most holy<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> night</l>
<l rend="i0">When all created things know and adore</l>
<l rend="i0">The Power that made them; insects, beasts, and birds,</l>
<l rend="i0">The water-dwellers, herbs and trees and stones,</l>
<l rend="i0">Yea Earth and Ocean and the infinite Heaven</l>
<l rend="i0">With all its worlds. Man only does not know</l>
<l rend="i0">The universal sabbath, does not join</l>
<l rend="i0">With Nature in her homage. Yet the prayer</l>
<l rend="i0">Flows from the righteous with intenser love,</l>
<l rend="i0">A holier calm succeeds, and sweeter dreams</l>
<l rend="i0">Visit the slumbers of the penitent.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Therefore on Maimuna the elements,</l>
<l rend="i0">Shed healing; every breath she breathed was balm.</l>
<l rend="i0">Was not a flower but sent in incense up</l>
<l rend="i0">Its richest odours, and the song of birds</l>
<l rend="i0">Now, like the music of the Seraphim,</l>
<l rend="i4">Entered her soul, and now</l>
<l rend="i0">Made silence aweful by their sudden pause.</l>
<l rend="i2">It seemed as if the quiet moon</l>
<l rend="i2">Poured quietness, its lovely light</l>
<l rend="i0">Was like the smile of reconciling Heaven.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Is it the dew of night</l>
<l rend="i4">That down her glowing cheek</l>
<l rend="i0">Shines in the moon-beam? oh! she weeps ... she weeps</l>
<l rend="i0">And the Good Angel that abandoned her</l>
<l rend="i0">At her hell-baptism, by her tears drawn down</l>
<l rend="i2">Resumes his charge, then Maimuna</l>
<l rend="i0">Recalled to mind the double oracle;</l>
<l rend="i4">Quick as the lightening flash</l>
<l rend="i0">Its import glanced upon her, and the hope</l>
<l rend="i2">Of pardon and salvation rose,</l>
<l rend="i4">As now she understood</l>
<l rend="i2">The lying prophecy of truth.</l>
<l rend="i2">She pauses not, she ponders not,</l>
<l rend="i0">The driven air before her fanned the face</l>
<l rend="i0">Of Thalaba, and he awoke and saw</l>
<l rend="i2">The Sorceress of the silver locks.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">One more permitted spell!</l>
<l rend="i4">She takes the magic chain.</l>
<l rend="i0">With the wide eye of wonder, Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i0">Watches her snowy fingers round and round</l>
<l rend="i4">Wind the loosening chain.</l>
<l rend="i2">Again he hears the low sweet voice,</l>
<l rend="i2">The low sweet voice so musical,</l>
<l rend="i4">That sure it was not strange,</l>
<l rend="i0">If in those unintelligible tones</l>
<l rend="i2">Was more than human potency,</l>
<l rend="i0">That with such deep and undefined delight,</l>
<l rend="i4">Filled the surrendered soul.</l>
<l rend="i2">The work is done, the song is ceased;</l>
<l rend="i0">He wakes as from a dream of Paradise</l>
<l rend="i0">And feels his fetters gone, and with the burst</l>
<l rend="i0">Of wondering adoration praises God.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Her charm has loosed the chain it bound,</l>
<l rend="i2">But massy walls and iron gates</l>
<l rend="i4">Confine Hodeirah's son.</l>
<l rend="i0">Heard ye not, Genii of the Air, her spell,</l>
<l rend="i4">That o'er her face there flits</l>
<l rend="i4">The sudden flush of fear?</l>
<l rend="i0">Again her louder lips repeat the charm,</l>
<l rend="i2">Her eye is anxious, her cheek pale,</l>
<l rend="i4">Her pulse plays fast and feeble.</l>
<l rend="i2">Nay Maimuna! thy power has ceased,</l>
<l rend="i4">And the wind scatters now</l>
<l rend="i4">The voice that ruled it late.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"Pray for me, Thalaba," she cried,</l>
<l rend="i2">"For death and judgement are at hand!"</l>
<l rend="i4">All night in agony,</l>
<l rend="i0">She feared the instant blow of Hell's revenge.</l>
<l rend="i0">At dawn the sound of gathering multitudes</l>
<l rend="i0">Led to the prison bars her dreading eye.</l>
<l rend="i4">What spectacle invites</l>
<l rend="i4">The growing multitude,</l>
<l rend="i2">That torrent-like they roll along?</l>
<l rend="i0">Boys and grey-headed age; the Mother comes</l>
<l rend="i2">Leading her child, who at arm's length</l>
<l rend="i4">Outstripping her, looks back</l>
<l rend="i4">And bids her hasten more.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Why does the City pour her thousands forth?</l>
<l rend="i4">What glorious pageantry</l>
<l rend="i0">Makes her streets desolate, and silences</l>
<l rend="i0">Her empty dwellings? comes the bridal pomp,</l>
<l rend="i0">And have the purveyors of imperial lust</l>
<l rend="i2">Torn from their parents arms again</l>
<l rend="i2">The virgin beauties of the land?</l>
<l rend="i0">Will elephants in gilded cages bear</l>
<l rend="i0">The imprisoned victims? or may yet their eyes</l>
<l rend="i0">With a last look of liberty, behold</l>
<l rend="i0">Banners and guards and silk-arched palanquins.</l>
<l rend="i0">The long procession, and the gorgeous pomp</l>
<l rend="i4">Of their own sacrifice?</l>
<l rend="i0">On the house tops and in the windows ranged</l>
<l rend="i4">Face above face, they wait</l>
<l rend="i4">The coming spectacle;</l>
<l rend="i0">The trees are clustered, and below the dust</l>
<l rend="i4">Thro' the thronged populace</l>
<l rend="i4">Can find no way to rise.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">He comes! the Sultan! hark the swelling horn,</l>
<l rend="i4">The trumpet's spreading blair,</l>
<l rend="i0">The timbrel tinkling as its silver bells</l>
<l rend="i0">Twinkle aloft, and the shrill cymbal's sound,</l>
<l rend="i0">Whose broad brass flashes in the morning sun</l>
<l rend="i0">Accordant light and music! closing all</l>
<l rend="i4">The heavy Gong is heard,</l>
<l rend="i0">That falls like thunder on the dizzy ear.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">On either hand the thick-wedged crowd</l>
<l rend="i4">Fall from the royal path.</l>
<l rend="i0">Recumbent in the palanquin he casts</l>
<l rend="i0">On the wide tumult of the waving throng</l>
<l rend="i4">A proud and idle eye.</l>
<l rend="i0">Now in his tent alighted, he receives</l>
<l rend="i0">Homage and worship. The slave multitude</l>
<l rend="i2">With shouts of blasphemy adore</l>
<l rend="i0">Him, father of his people! him their Lord!</l>
<l rend="i0">Great King, all-wise, all-mighty, and all-good!</l>
<l rend="i0">Whose smile was happiness, whose frown was death,</l>
<l rend="i4">Their present Deity!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">With silken cords his slaves</l>
<l rend="i0">Wave the silk<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> fan, that waving o'er his head</l>
<l rend="i4">Freshens the languid air.</l>
<l rend="i2">Others the while shower o'er his robes</l>
<l rend="i4">The rose's treasured sweets,</l>
<l rend="i0">Rich odours burn before him, ambergrese,</l>
<l rend="i4">Sandal and aloe wood,</l>
<l rend="i0">And thus inhaling the voluptuous air</l>
<l rend="i2">He sits to watch the agony,</l>
<l rend="i4">To hear the groan of death.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">At once all sounds are hushed,</l>
<l rend="i0">All eyes take one direction, for he comes,</l>
<l rend="i0">The object he of this day's festival,</l>
<l rend="i0">Of all this expectation and this joy,</l>
<l rend="i0">The Christian captive. Hark! so silently</l>
<l rend="i0">They stand, the clanking of his chain is heard.</l>
<l rend="i0">And he has reached the place of suffering now.</l>
<l rend="i0">And as the death's-men round his ancles bind</l>
<l rend="i0">The cords and to the gibbet swing him up,</l>
<l rend="i0">The Priests begin their song, the song of praise,</l>
<l rend="i0">The hymn of glory to their Devil-God.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Then Maimuna grew pale, as thro the bars</l>
<l rend="i0">She saw the Martyr pendant by the feet,</l>
<l rend="i0">His gold locks hanging downwards, and she cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"This is my Sister's deed!</l>
<l rend="i4">"O Thalaba, for us,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Not for his faith the red-haired Christian dies.</l>
<l rend="i0">"She wants the foam<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> that in his agony,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Last from his lips shall fall,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The deadliest poison that the Devils know.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Son of Hodeirah, thou and I</l>
<l rend="i4">"Shall prove its deadly force!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">And lo! the Executioners begin</l>
<l rend="i0">And beat his belly with alternate blows.</l>
<l rend="i2">And these are human that look on;...</l>
<l rend="i2">The very women that would shrink</l>
<l rend="i2">And shudder if they saw a worm</l>
<l rend="i4">Crushed by the careless tread,</l>
<l rend="i4">They clap their hands for joy</l>
<l rend="i4">And lift their children up</l>
<l rend="i4">To see the Christian die.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Convulsing Nature with her tortures drunk</l>
<l rend="i4">Ceases to suffer now.</l>
<l rend="i2">His eye-lids tremble, his lips quake,</l>
<l rend="i0">But like the quivering of a severed limb</l>
<l rend="i4">Move no responsive pang.</l>
<l rend="i0">Now catch the exquisite poison! for it froths</l>
<l rend="i0">His dying lips,... and Khawla holds the bowl.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Enough the Island crimes had cried to Heaven,</l>
<l rend="i2">The measure of their guilt was full,</l>
<l rend="i4">The hour of wrath was come.</l>
<l rend="i4">The poison burst the bowl,</l>
<l rend="i4">It fell upon the earth.</l>
<l rend="i0">The Sorceress shrieked and caught Mohareb's robe</l>
<l rend="i2">And called the whirlwind and away!</l>
<l rend="i0">For lo! from that accursed venom springs,</l>
<l rend="i4">The Upas Tree of Death.</l></lg>

<l rend="i4">The Upas<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> Tree of Death.</l>
<l rend="i0">Thro' barren banks the barren waters flow,</l>
<l rend="i0">The fish that meets them in the unmingling sea</l>
<l rend="i4">Floats poisoned on the waves.</l>
<l rend="i0">Tree grows not near, nor bush, nor flower, nor herb,</l>
<l rend="i0">The Earth has lost its parent powers of life</l>
<l rend="i0">And the fresh dew of Heaven that there descends,</l>
<l rend="i4">Steams in rank poison up.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Before the appointed Youth and Maimuna</l>
<l rend="i0">Saw the first struggle of the dying throng,</l>
<l rend="i4">Crash sunk their prison wall!</l>
<l rend="i4">The whirlwind wrapt them round;</l>
<l rend="i2">Borne in the Chariot of the Winds</l>
<l rend="i0">Ere there was time to fear, their way was past,</l>
<l rend="i4">And lo! again they stand</l>
<l rend="i0">In the cave-dwelling of the blue-eyed Witch.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Then came the weakness of her natural age</l>
<l rend="i4">At once on Maimuna;</l>
<l rend="i4">The burthen of her years</l>
<l rend="i4">Fell on her, and she knew</l>
<l rend="i0">That her repentance in the sight of God</l>
<l rend="i0">Had now found favour, and her hour was come.</l>
<l rend="i0">Her death was like the righteous; "Turn my face</l>
<l rend="i2">"To Mecca!" in her languid eyes.</l>
<l rend="i4">The joy of certain hope</l>
<l rend="i2">Lit a last lustre, and in death</l>
<l rend="i4">The smile was on her cheek.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">No faithful<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> crowded round her bier,</l>
<l rend="i2">No tongue reported her good deeds,</l>
<l rend="i2">For her no mourners wailed and wept,</l>
<l rend="i2">No Iman o'er her perfumed corpse,</l>
<l rend="i2">For her soul's health intoned the prayer;</l>
<l rend="i2">No column<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> raised by the way side</l>
<l rend="i2">Implored the passing traveller</l>
<l rend="i2">To say a requiem for the dead.</l>
<l rend="i2">Thalaba laid her in the snow,</l>
<l rend="i2">And took his weapons from the hearth,</l>
<l rend="i2">And then once more the youth began</l>
<l rend="i2">His weary way of solitude.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">The breath of the East is in his face</l>
<l rend="i2">And it drives the sleet and the snow.</l>
<l rend="i2">The air is keen, the wind is keen,</l>
<l rend="i2">His limbs are aching with the cold,</l>
<l rend="i2">His eyes are aching<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> with the snow,</l>
<l rend="i4">His very heart is cold,</l>
<l rend="i0">His spirit chilled within him. He looks on</l>
<l rend="i4">If ought of life be near,</l>
<l rend="i0">But all is sky and the white wilderness,</l>
<l rend="i0">And here and there a solitary pine,</l>
<l rend="i0">Its branches broken by the weight of snow.</l>
<l rend="i2">His pains abate, his senses dull</l>
<l rend="i2">With suffering, cease to suffer.</l>
<l rend="i4">Languidly, languidly,</l>
<l rend="i4">Thalaba drags along,</l>
<l rend="i2">A heavy weight is on his lids,</l>
<l rend="i2">His limbs move slow with heaviness,</l>
<l rend="i4">And he full fain would sleep.</l>
<l rend="i2">Not yet, not yet, O Thalaba!</l>
<l rend="i4">Thy hour of rest is come;</l>
<l rend="i2">Not yet may the Destroyer sleep</l>
<l rend="i4">The comfortable sleep,</l>
<l rend="i2">His journey is not over yet,</l>
<l rend="i4">His course not yet fulfilled;...</l>
<l rend="i2">Run thou thy race, O Thalaba!</l>
<l rend="i4">The prize is at the goal.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">It was a Cedar-tree</l>
<l rend="i0">That woke him from the deadly drowsiness;</l>
<l rend="i0">Its broad, round-spreading<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> branches when they felt</l>
<l rend="i0">The snow, rose upward in a point to heaven,</l>
<l rend="i2">And standing in their strength erect,</l>
<l rend="i4">Defied the baffled storm.</l>
<l rend="i2">He knew the lesson Nature gave,</l>
<l rend="i2">And he shook off his heaviness,</l>
<l rend="i4">And hope revived within him.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Now sunk the evening sun,</l>
<l rend="i4">A broad, red, beamless orb,</l>
<l rend="i4">Adown the glowing sky;</l>
<l rend="i0">Thro' the red light the snow-flakes fell, like fire.</l>
<l rend="i2">Louder grows the biting wind,</l>
<l rend="i2">And it drifts the dust of the snow.</l>
<l rend="i2">The snow is clotted in his hair,</l>
<l rend="i4">The breath of Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i4">Is iced upon his lips.</l>
<l rend="i2">He looks around, the darkness,</l>
<l rend="i2">The dizzy floating of the snow,</l>
<l rend="i4">Close in his narrow view.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">At length thro' the thick atmosphere a light</l>
<l rend="i4">Not distant far appears.</l>
<l rend="i0">He doubting other wiles of enmity,</l>
<l rend="i2">With mingled joy and quicker step,</l>
<l rend="i4">Bends his way thitherward.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">It was a little, lowly dwelling place,</l>
<l rend="i0">Amid a garden, whose delightful air</l>
<l rend="i0">Felt mild and fragrant, as the evening wind</l>
<l rend="i0">Passing in summer o'er the coffee-groves<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></l>
<l rend="i0">Of Yemen and its blessed bowers of balm.</l>
<l rend="i0">A Fount of Fire that in the centre played,</l>
<l rend="i0">Rolled all around its wonderous rivulets</l>
<l rend="i0">And fed the garden with the heat of life.</l>
<l rend="i0">Every where magic! the Arabian's heart</l>
<l rend="i2">Yearned after human intercourse.</l>
<l rend="i4">A light!... the door unclosed!...</l>
<l rend="i4">All silent ... he goes in.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">There lay a Damsel sleeping on a couch,</l>
<l rend="i0">His step awoke her, and she gazed at him</l>
<l rend="i4">With pleased and wondering look,</l>
<l rend="i2">Fearlessly, like a yearling child</l>
<l rend="i4">Too ignorant to fear.</l>
<l rend="i4">With words of courtesy</l>
<l rend="i4">The young intruder spake.</l>
<l rend="i2">At the sound of his voice a joy</l>
<l rend="i4">Kindled her bright black eyes;</l>
<l rend="i4">She rose and took his hand,</l>
<l rend="i0">But at the touch the smile forsook her cheek,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Oh! it is cold!" she cried,</l>
<l rend="i0">"I thought I should have felt it warm like mine,</l>
<l rend="i4">"But thou art like the rest!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Thalaba stood mute awhile</l>
<l rend="i4">And wondering at her words:</l>
<l rend="i0">"Cold? Lady!" then he said; "I have travelled long</l>
<l rend="i4">"In this cold wilderness,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Till life is almost spent!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LAILA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Art thou a Man then?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">I did not think</l>
<l rend="i0">Sorrow and toil could so have altered me,</l>
<l rend="i0">That I seem otherwise.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LAILA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">  And thou canst be warm</l>
<l rend="i0">Sometimes? life-warm as I am?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i12">Surely Lady</l><l rend="i0">As others are, I am, to heat and cold</l>
<l rend="i0">Subject like all, you see a Traveller,</l>
<l rend="i0">Bound upon hard adventure, who requests</l>
<l rend="i0">Only to rest him here to-night, to-morrow</l>
<l rend="i0">He will pursue his way.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LAILA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">   Oh ... not to-morrow!</l>
<l rend="i0">Not like a dream of joy, depart so soon!</l>
<l rend="i0">And whither wouldst thou go? for all around</l>
<l rend="i0">Is everlasting winter, ice and snow,</l>
<l rend="i0">Deserts unpassable of endless frost.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">He who has led me here will still sustain me</l>
<l rend="i0">Thro' cold and hunger.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"Hunger?" Laila cried;</l>
<l rend="i4">She clapt her lilly hands,</l>
<l rend="i0">And whether from above or from below</l>
<l rend="i4">It came, sight could not see,</l>
<l rend="i0">So suddenly the floor was spread with food.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LAILA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Why dost thou watch with hesitating eyes</l>
<l rend="i0">The banquet? 'tis for thee! I bade it come.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Whence came it?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LAILA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i6">  Matters it from whence it came</l>
<l rend="i0">My father sent it: when I call, he hears.</l>
<l rend="i0">Nay ... thou hast fabled with me! and art like</l>
<l rend="i0">The forms that wait upon my solitude,</l>
<l rend="i0">Human to eye alone;... thy hunger would not</l>
<l rend="i0">Question so idly else.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">I will not eat!</l>
<l rend="i0">It came by magic! fool to think that aught</l>
<l rend="i0">But fraud and danger could await me here!</l>
<l rend="i0">Let loose my cloak!...</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LAILA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">  Begone then, insolent!</l>
<l rend="i0">Why dost thou stand and gaze upon my face?</l>
<l rend="i0">Aye! watch the features well that threaten thee</l>
<l rend="i0">With fraud and danger! in the wilderness</l>
<l rend="i0">They shall avenge me,... in the hour of want</l>
<l rend="i2">Rise on thy view, and make thee feel</l>
<l rend="i4">How innocent I am:</l>
<l rend="i0">And this remembered cowardice and insult</l>
<l rend="i0">With a more painful shame will burn thy cheek</l>
<l rend="i0">Than now beats mine in anger!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i12">Mark me Lady!</l><l rend="i0">Many and restless are my enemies;</l>
<l rend="i0">My daily paths have been beset with snares</l>
<l rend="i0">Till I have learnt suspicion, bitter sufferings</l>
<l rend="i0">Teaching the needful vice, if I have wronged you,</l>
<l rend="i0">And yours should be the face of innocence,</l>
<l rend="i0">I pray you pardon me! in the name of God,</l>
<l rend="i0">And of his Prophet, I partake your food.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LAILA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Lo now! thou wert afraid of sorcery,</l>
<l rend="i0">And yet hast said a charm!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i10">A charm?</l></lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LAILA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i14">And wherefore?</l><l rend="i0">Is it not not delicate food? what mean thy words?</l>
<l rend="i0">I have heard many spells and many names</l>
<l rend="i0">That rule the Genii and the Elements,</l>
<l rend="i0">But never these.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i6">How! never heard the names</l>
<l rend="i0">Of God and of the Prophet?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LAILA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i11">Never ... nay now</l><l rend="i0">Again that troubled eye? thou art a strange man</l>
<l rend="i0">And wonderous fearful ... but I must not twice</l>
<l rend="i0">Be charged with fraud! if thou suspectest still,</l>
<l rend="i0">Depart and leave me!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">And you do not know</l>
<l rend="i0">The God that made you?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LAILA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i10">Made me, man! my Father</l><l rend="i0">Made me. He made this dwelling, and the grove,</l>
<l rend="i0">And yonder fountain-fire, and every morn</l>
<l rend="i0">He visits me, and takes the snow, and moulds</l>
<l rend="i0">Women and men, like thee; and breathes into them</l>
<l rend="i0">Motion, and life, and sense,... but to the touch</l>
<l rend="i0">They are chilling cold, and ever when night closes</l>
<l rend="i0">They melt away again, and leave me here</l>
<l rend="i0">Alone and sad. Oh then how I rejoice</l>
<l rend="i0">When it is day and my dear Father comes,</l>
<l rend="i0">And chears me with kind words and kinder looks!</l>
<l rend="i0">My dear, dear, Father! were it not for him,</l>
<l rend="i0">I am so weary of this loneliness,</l>
<l rend="i0">That I should wish I also were of snow</l>
<l rend="i0">That I might melt away, and cease to be.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">And have you always had your dwelling here</l>
<l rend="i0">Amid this solitude of snow?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LAILA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i11">I think so.</l><l rend="i0">I can remember with unsteady feet</l>
<l rend="i0">Tottering from room to room, and finding pleasure</l>
<l rend="i0">In flowers and toys and sweetmeats, things that long</l>
<l rend="i0">Have lost their power to please; that when I see them</l>
<l rend="i0">Raise only now a melancholy wish</l>
<l rend="i0">I were the little trifler once again</l>
<l rend="i0">That could be pleased so lightly!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i12">Then you know not</l><l rend="i0">Your Father's art?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LAILA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">No. I besought him once</l>
<l rend="i0">To give me power like his, that where he went</l>
<l rend="i0">I might go with him: but he shook his head,</l>
<l rend="i0">And said it was a power too dearly bought,</l>
<l rend="i0">And kist me with the tenderness of tears.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">And wherefore has he hidden you thus far</l>
<l rend="i0">From all the ways of humankind?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LAILA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i12">'Twas fear,</l><l rend="i0">Fatherly fear and love. He read<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> the stars</l>
<l rend="i0">And saw a danger in my destiny,</l>
<l rend="i0">And therefore placed me here amid the snows,</l>
<l rend="i0">And laid a spell that never human eye,</l>
<l rend="i0">If foot of man by chance should reach the depth</l>
<l rend="i0">Of this wide waste, shall see one trace of grove,</l>
<l rend="i0">Garden, or dwelling-place, or yonder fire,</l>
<l rend="i0">That thaws and mitigates the frozen sky.</l>
<l rend="i0">And more than this, even if the enemy</l>
<l rend="i0">Should come, I have a guardian here.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i14">A guardian?</l></lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LAILA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">'Twas well that when my sight unclosed upon thee</l>
<l rend="i0">There was no dark suspicion in thy face.</l>
<l rend="i0">Else I had called his succour! wilt thou see him?</l>
<l rend="i0">But if a Woman can have terrified thee,</l>
<l rend="i0">How wilt thou bare his unrelaxing brow</l>
<l rend="i0">And lifted lightnings?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">Lead me to him, Lady!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">She took him by the hand</l>
<l rend="i4">And thro' the porch they past.</l>
<l rend="i2">Over the garden and the grove</l>
<l rend="i4">The fountain streams of fire</l>
<l rend="i4">Poured a broad light like noon.</l>
<l rend="i4">A broad unnatural light</l>
<l rend="i0">That made the Rose's blush of beauty pale,</l>
<l rend="i0">And dimmed the rich Geranium's scarlet blaze.</l>
<l rend="i2">The various verdure of the grove</l>
<l rend="i0">Now wore one undistinguishable grey,</l>
<l rend="i4">Checqured with blacker shade.</l>
<l rend="i4">Suddenly Laila stopt,</l>
<l rend="i0">"I do not think thou art the enemy,"</l>
<l rend="i4">She said, "but He will know!</l>
<l rend="i2">"If thou hast meditated wrong</l>
<l rend="i4">"Stranger, depart in time....</l>
<l rend="i2">"I would not lead thee to thy death!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The glance of Laila's eye</l>
<l rend="i0">Turned anxiously toward the Arabian youth.</l>
<l rend="i0">"So let him pierce my heart," cried Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i0">"If it hide thought to harm you!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LAILA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i12">'Tis a figure,</l><l rend="i0">Almost I fear to look at!... yet come on.</l>
<l rend="i0">'Twill ease me of a heaviness that seems</l>
<l rend="i0">To sink my heart; and thou mayest dwell here then.</l>
<l rend="i0">In safety;... for thou shalt not go to-morrow,</l>
<l rend="i0">Nor on the after, nor the after day,</l>
<l rend="i0">Nor ever! it was only solitude</l>
<l rend="i4">That made my misery here,...</l>
<l rend="i0">And now that I can see a human face,</l>
<l rend="i4">And hear a human voice....</l>
<l rend="i4">Oh no! thou wilt not leave me!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Alas I must not rest!</l>
<l rend="i0">The star that ruled at my nativity</l>
<l rend="i0">Shone with a strange and blasting influence.</l>
<l rend="i0">O gentle Lady! I should draw upon you</l>
<l rend="i0">A killing curse.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">LAILA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i6">But I will ask my Father</l>
<l rend="i0">To save you from all danger, and you know not</l>
<l rend="i0">The wonders he can work, and when I ask</l>
<l rend="i0">It is not in his power to say me nay.</l>
<l rend="i0">Perhaps thou knowest the happiness it is</l>
<l rend="i0">To have a tender father?</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i10">He was one</l><l rend="i0">Whom like a loathsome leper I have tainted</l>
<l rend="i0">With my contagious destiny. At evening</l>
<l rend="i0">He kist me as he wont, and laid his hands</l>
<l rend="i0">Upon my head, and blest me ere I slept.</l>
<l rend="i0">His dying groan awoke me, for the Murderer</l>
<l rend="i0">Had stolen upon our sleep! for me was meant</l>
<l rend="i0">The midnight blow of death; my father died,</l>
<l rend="i0">The brother play-mates of my infancy,</l>
<l rend="i0">The baby at the breast, they perished all,</l>
<l rend="i0">All in that dreadful hour: but I was saved</l>
<l rend="i4">To remember and revenge.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">She answered not, for now</l>
<l rend="i0">Emerging from the o'er-arched avenue</l>
<l rend="i2">The finger of her upraised hand</l>
<l rend="i0">Marked where the Guardian of the garden stood.</l>
<l rend="i0">It was a brazen<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Image, every limb</l>
<l rend="i0">And swelling vein and muscle, true to life:</l>
<l rend="i4">The left knee bending on,</l>
<l rend="i0">The other straight, firm planted, and his hand</l>
<l rend="i4">Lifted on high to hurl</l>
<l rend="i4">The Lightning that it grasped.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">When Thalaba approached,</l>
<l rend="i0">The charmed Image knew Hodeirah's son,</l>
<l rend="i0">And hurled the lightning at the dreaded foe.</l>
<l rend="i4">The Ring! the saviour Ring!</l>
<l rend="i0">Full in his face the lightning-bolt was driven,</l>
<l rend="i4">The scattered fire recoiled.</l>
<l rend="i0">Like the flowing of a summer gale he felt</l>
<l rend="i4">Its ineffectual force,</l>
<l rend="i2">His countenance was not changed,</l>
<l rend="i2">Nor a hair of his head was singed.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">He started and his glance</l>
<l rend="i2">Turned angrily upon the Maid,</l>
<l rend="i0">The sight disarmed suspicion ... breathless, pale,</l>
<l rend="i4">Against a tree she stood.</l>
<l rend="i2">Her wan lips quivering, and her eye</l>
<l rend="i0">Upraised, in silent supplicating fear.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">She started with a scream of joy</l>
<l rend="i4">Seeing her Father there,</l>
<l rend="i0">And ran and threw her arms around his neck,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Save me!" she cried, "the Enemy is come!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Save me! save me! Okba!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"Okba!" repeats the youth,</l>
<l rend="i4">For never since that hour</l>
<l rend="i0">When in the Tent the Spirit told his name,</l>
<l rend="i4">Had Thalaba let slip</l>
<l rend="i0">The memory of his Father's murderer;</l>
<l rend="i4">"Okba!"... and in his hand</l>
<l rend="i4">He graspt an arrow-shaft.</l>
<l rend="i2">And he rushed on to strike him.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Son of Hodeirah!" the Old Man replied,</l>
<l rend="i4">"My hour is not yet come."</l>
<l rend="i4">And putting forth his hand</l>
<l rend="i2">Gently he repelled the Youth.</l>
<l rend="i4">"My hour is not yet come!</l>
<l rend="i0">"But thou mayest shed this innocent Maiden's blood,</l>
<l rend="i2">"That vengeance God allows thee."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Around her Father's neck</l>
<l rend="i4">Still Laila's hands were clasped.</l>
<l rend="i2">Her face was turned to Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i0">A broad light floated o'er its marble paleness,</l>
<l rend="i2">As the wind waved the fountain fire.</l>
<l rend="i0">Her large, dilated eye in horror raised</l>
<l rend="i4">Watched his every movement.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Not upon her," said he,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Not upon her Hodeirah's blood cries out</l>
<l rend="i0">"For vengeance!" and again his lifted arm</l>
<l rend="i4">Threatened the Sorcerer,</l>
<l rend="i4">Again withheld it felt</l>
<l rend="i0">The barrier that no human strength could burst.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Thou dost not aim the blow more eagerly,"</l>
<l rend="i0">Okba replied, "than I would rush to meet it!</l>
<l rend="i4">"But that were poor revenge.</l>
<l rend="i4">"O Thalaba, thy God</l>
<l rend="i4">"Wreaks on the innocent head</l>
<l rend="i0">"His vengeance;... I must suffer in my child!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Why dost thou pause to strike thy victim? Allah</l>
<l rend="i4">"Permits, commands the deed."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"Liar!" quoth Thalaba.</l>
<l rend="i4">And Laila's wondering eye</l>
<l rend="i0">Looked up, all anguish to her Father's face,</l>
<l rend="i0">"By Allah and the Prophet," he replied,</l>
<l rend="i4">"I speak the words of truth.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Misery, misery,</l>
<l rend="i0">"That I must beg mine enemy to speed</l>
<l rend="i0">"The inevitable vengeance now so near!</l>
<l rend="i2">"I read it in her horoscope,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Her birth-star warned me of Hodeirah's race.</l>
<l rend="i0">"I laid a spell, and called a Spirit up.</l>
<l rend="i4">"He answered one must die</l>
<l rend="i4">"Laila or Thalaba....</l>
<l rend="i2">"Accursed Spirit! even in truth</l>
<l rend="i4">"Giving a lying hope!</l>
<l rend="i2">"Last, I ascended the seventh Heaven</l>
<l rend="i0">"And on the everlasting<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> Table there</l>
<l rend="i4">"In characters of light,</l>
<l rend="i4">"I read her written doom.</l>
<l rend="i0">"The years that it has gnawn me! and the load</l>
<l rend="i0">"Of sin that it has laid upon my soul!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Curse on this hand that in the only hour</l>
<l rend="i4">"The favouring stars allowed</l>
<l rend="i2">"Reeked with other blood than thine.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Still dost thou stand and gaze incredulous?</l>
<l rend="i0">"Young man, be merciful, and keep her not</l>
<l rend="i4">"Longer in agony!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Thalaba's unbelieving frown</l>
<l rend="i4">Scowled on the Sorcerer,</l>
<l rend="i0">When in the air the rush of wings was heard</l>
<l rend="i4">And Azrael stood among them.</l>
<l rend="i2">In equal terror at the sight</l>
<l rend="i2">The Enchanter, the Destroyer stood,</l>
<l rend="i4">And Laila, the victim maid.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Son of Hodeirah!" said the Angel of Death,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The accursed fables not.</l>
<l rend="i2">"When from the Eternal Hand I took</l>
<l rend="i4">"The yearly<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> scroll of fate,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Her name was written there.</l>
<l rend="i2">"This is the hour, and from thy hands</l>
<l rend="i0">"Commissioned to receive the Maid I come."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Hear me O Angel!" Thalaba replied,</l>
<l rend="i4">"To avenge my Father's death,</l>
<l rend="i4">"To work the will of Heaven,</l>
<l rend="i0">"To root from earth the accursed sorcerer race,</l>
<l rend="i2">"I have dared danger undismayed,</l>
<l rend="i2">"I have lost all my soul held dear,</l>
<l rend="i0">"I am cut off from all the ties of life,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Unmurmuring; for whate'er awaits me still,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Pursuing to the end the enterprize,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Peril or pain, I bear a ready heart.</l>
<l rend="i2">"But strike this Maid! this innocent!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Angel, I dare not do it."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Remember," answered Azrael, "all thou sayest</l>
<l rend="i0">"Is written down for judgement! every word</l>
<l rend="i0">"In the balance of<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> thy trial must be weighed!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">"So be it!" said the Youth.</l>
<l rend="i0">"He who can read the secrets of the heart</l>
<l rend="i2">"Will judge with righteousness!</l>
<l rend="i4">"This is no doubtful path,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The voice of God within me cannot lie....</l>
<l rend="i2">"I will not harm the innocent."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">He said, and from above,</l>
<l rend="i2">As tho' it were the Voice of Night,</l>
<l rend="i4">The startling answer came.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Son of Hodeirah, think again!</l>
<l rend="i4">"One must depart from hence,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Laila, or Thalaba;</l>
<l rend="i2">"She dies for thee, or thou for her,</l>
<l rend="i4">"It must be life for life!</l>
<l rend="i2">"Son of Hodeirah, weigh it well,</l>
<l rend="i4">"While yet the choice is thine!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">He hesitated not,</l>
<l rend="i0">But looking upward spread his hands to Heaven,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Oneiza, in thy bower of Paradise</l>
<l rend="i4">"Receive me, still unstained!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"What!" exclaimed Okba, "darest thou disobey,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Abandoning all claim</l>
<l rend="i4">"To Allah's longer aid?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">The eager exultation of his speech</l>
<l rend="i0">Earthward recalled the thoughts of Thalaba.</l>
<l rend="i0">"And dost thou triumph, Murderer? dost thou deem</l>
<l rend="i0">"Because I perish, that the unsleeping lids</l>
<l rend="i0">"Of Justice shall be closed upon thy crime?</l>
<l rend="i0">"Poor, miserable man! that thou canst live</l>
<l rend="i0">"With such beast-blindness in the present joy</l>
<l rend="i2">"When o'er thy head the sword of God</l>
<l rend="i4">"Hangs for the certain stroke!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Servant of Allah, thou hast disobeyed,</l>
<l rend="i4">"God hath abandoned thee,</l>
<l rend="i4">"This hour is mine!" cried Okba,</l>
<l rend="i4">And shook his Daughter off,</l>
<l rend="i2">And drew the dagger from his vest.</l>
<l rend="i4">And aimed the deadly blow.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">All was accomplished. Laila rushed between</l>
<l rend="i4">To save the saviour Youth.</l>
<l rend="i0">She met the blow and sunk into his arms,</l>
<l rend="i0">And Azrael from the hands<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> of Thalaba</l>

<l rend="i2">O fool to think thy human hand</l>
<l rend="i0">Could check the chariot-wheels of Destiny</l>
<l rend="i0">To dream of weakness in the all-knowing Mind</l>
<l rend="i4">That his decrees should change!</l>
<l rend="i2">To hope that the united Powers</l>
<l rend="i4">Of Earth, and Air, and Hell,</l>
<l rend="i0">Might blot one letter from the Book of Fate,</l>
<l rend="i0">Might break one link of the eternal chain!</l>
<l rend="i0">Thou miserable, wicked, poor old man,</l>
<l rend="i0">Fall now upon the body of thy child,</l>
<l rend="i0">Beat now thy breast, and pluck the bleeding hairs</l>
<l rend="i4">From thy grey beard, and lay</l>
<l rend="i0">Thine ineffectual hand to close her wound.</l>
<l rend="i4">And call on Hell to aid,</l>
<l rend="i4">And call on Heaven to send</l>
<l rend="i4">Its merciful thunderbolt!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">The young Arabian silently</l>
<l rend="i4">Beheld his frantic grief.</l>
<l rend="i2">The presence of the hated youth</l>
<l rend="i4">To raging anguish stung</l>
<l rend="i4">The wretched Sorcerer.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Aye! look and triumph!" he exclaimed,</l>
<l rend="i2">"This is the justice of thy God!</l>
<l rend="i2">"A righteous God is he, to let</l>
<l rend="i0">"His vengeance fall upon the innocent head!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Curse thee, curse thee, Thalaba!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">All feelings of revenge</l>
<l rend="i4">Had left Hodeirah's son.</l>
<l rend="i2">Pitying and silently he heard</l>
<l rend="i0">The victim of his own iniquities,</l>
<l rend="i4">Not with the busy hand</l>
<l rend="i0">Of Consolation, fretting the sore wound</l>
<l rend="i4">He could not hope to heal.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">So as the Servant of the Prophet stood,</l>
<l rend="i2">With sudden motion the night air</l>
<l rend="i2">Gently fanned his cheek.</l>
<l rend="i4">'Twas a Green Bird whose wings</l>
<l rend="i4">Had waved the quiet air.</l>
<l rend="i4">On the hand of Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i4">The Green Bird perched, and turned</l>
<l rend="i2">A mild eye up, as if to win</l>
<l rend="i4">The Adventurer's confidence.</l>
<l rend="i2">Then springing on flew forward,</l>
<l rend="i4">And now again returns</l>
<l rend="i4">To court him to the way;</l>
<l rend="i4">And now his hand perceives</l>
<l rend="i0">Her rosy feet press firmer, as she leaps</l>
<l rend="i4">Upon the wing again.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Obedient to the call,</l>
<l rend="i0">By the pale moonlight Thalaba pursued</l>
<l rend="i4">O'er trackless snows his way;</l>
<l rend="i0">Unknowing he what blessed messenger</l>
<l rend="i4">Had come to guide his steps,</l>
<l rend="i0">That Laila's Spirit went before his path.</l>
<l rend="i0">Brought up in darkness and the child of sin,</l>
<l rend="i0">Yet as the meed of spotless innocence,</l>
<l rend="i0">Just Heaven permitted her by one good deed</l>
<l rend="i0">To work her own redemption, after death;</l>
<l rend="i4">So till the judgement day</l>
<l rend="i4">She might abide in bliss,</l>

</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The morning sun came forth,</l>
<l rend="i4">Wakening no eye to life</l>
<l rend="i4">In this wide solitude;</l>
<l rend="i0">His radiance with a saffron hue, like heat,</l>
<l rend="i4">Suffused the desert snow.</l>
<l rend="i2">The Green Bird guided Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i0">Now oaring with slow wing her upward way,</l>
<l rend="i2">Descending now in slant descent</l>
<l rend="i2">On out-spread pinions motionless,</l>
<l rend="i0">Floating now with rise and fall alternate,</l>
<l rend="i2">As if the billows of the air</l>
<l rend="i2">Heaved her with their sink and swell.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">And when, beneath the noon,</l>
<l rend="i2">The icey glitter of the snow</l>
<l rend="i4">Dazzled his aching sight,</l>
<l rend="i0">Then on his arm alighted the Green Bird</l>
<l rend="i4">And spread before his eyes</l>
<l rend="i2">Her plumage of refreshing hue.</l>
<l rend="i2">Evening came on; the glowing clouds</l>
<l rend="i0">Tinged with a purple ray the mountain ridge</l>
<l rend="i2">That lay before the Traveller.</l>
<l rend="i4">Ah! whither art thou gone,</l>
<l rend="i0">Guide and companion of the youth, whose eye</l>
<l rend="i2">Has lost thee in the depth of Heaven?</l>
<l rend="i4">Why hast thou left alone</l>
<l rend="i0">The weary wanderer in the wilderness?</l>
<l rend="i2">And now the western clouds grow pale</l>
<l rend="i0">And Night descends upon his solitude.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The Arabian youth knelt down,</l>
<l rend="i2">And bowed his forehead to the ground</l>
<l rend="i4">And made his evening prayer.</l>
<l rend="i0">When he arose the stars were bright in heaven,</l>
<l rend="i2">The sky was blue, and the cold Moon</l>
<l rend="i4">Shone over the cold snow.</l>
<l rend="i4">A speck in the air!</l>
<l rend="i2">Is it his guide that approaches?</l>
<l rend="i2">For it moves with the motion of life!</l>
<l rend="i0">Lo! she returns and scatters from her pinions</l>
<l rend="i0">Odours diviner than the gales of morning</l>
<l rend="i4">Waft from Sabea.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Hovering before the youth she hung,</l>
<l rend="i0">Till from her rosy feet that at his touch</l>
<l rend="i4">Uncurled their grasp, he took</l>
<l rend="i4">The fruitful bough they bore.</l>
<l rend="i2">He took and tasted, a new life</l>
<l rend="i2">Flowed thro' his renovated frame;</l>
<l rend="i2">His limbs that late were sore and stiff</l>
<l rend="i2">Felt all the freshness of repose,</l>
<l rend="i4">His dizzy brain was calmed.</l>
<l rend="i2">The heavy aching of his lids</l>
<l rend="i4">At once was taken off,</l>
<l rend="i0">For Laila from the Bowers of Paradise</l>
<l rend="i4">Had borne the healing<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> fruit.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">So up the mountain steep</l>
<l rend="i4">With untired foot he past,</l>
<l rend="i4">The Green Bird guiding him</l>
<l rend="i4">Mid crags, and ice, and rocks,</l>
<l rend="i0">A difficult way, winding the long ascent.</l>
<l rend="i0">How then the heart of Thalaba rejoiced</l>
<l rend="i2">When bosomed in the mountain depths,</l>
<l rend="i0">A sheltered Valley opened on his view!</l>
<l rend="i4">It was the Simorg's vale,</l>
<l rend="i2">The dwelling of the ancient Bird.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">On a green and mossy bank.</l>
<l rend="i4">Beside a rivulet</l>
<l rend="i4">The Bird of Ages stood.</l>
<l rend="i0">No sound intruded on his solitude,</l>
<l rend="i2">Only the rivulet was heard</l>
<l rend="i4">Whose everlasting flow</l>
<l rend="i2">From the birth-day of the world had made</l>
<l rend="i2">The same unvaried murmuring.</l>
<l rend="i4">Here dwelt the all-knowing Bird</l>
<l rend="i4">In deep tranquillity,</l>
<l rend="i4">His eyelids ever closed</l>
<l rend="i0">In full enjoyment of profound repose.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Reverently the youth approached</l>
<l rend="i4">That old and only<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Bird,</l>
<l rend="i2">And crossed his arms upon his breast,</l>
<l rend="i4">And bowed his head and spake.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Earliest of existing things,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Earliest thou, and wisest thou,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Guide me, guide me, on my way!</l>
<l rend="i4">"I am bound to seek the caverns</l>
<l rend="i4">"Underneath the roots of Ocean</l>
<l rend="i4">"Where the Sorcerer brood are nurst.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Thou the eldest, thou the wisest,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Guide me, guide me, on my way!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">The ancient Simorg on the youth</l>
<l rend="i4">Unclosed his thoughtful eyes,</l>
<l rend="i4">And answered to his prayer.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Northward by the stream proceed,</l>
<l rend="i2">"In the fountain of the rock</l>
<l rend="i2">"Wash away thy worldly stains,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Kneel thou there, and seek the Lord</l>
<l rend="i2">"And fortify thy soul with prayer.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Thus prepared ascend the Sledge,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Be bold, be wary, seek and find!</l>
<l rend="i4">"God hath appointed all."</l>
<l rend="i0">The ancient Simorg then let fall his lids</l>
<l rend="i4">Returning to repose.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Northward along the rivulet</l>
<l rend="i4">The adventurer went his way,</l>
<l rend="i0">Tracing its waters upward to their source.</l>
<l rend="i4">Green Bird of Paradise</l>
<l rend="i4">Thou hast not left the youth;...</l>
<l rend="i4">With slow associate flight</l>
<l rend="i4">She companies his way,</l>
<l rend="i0">And now they reach the fountain of the rock.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">There in the cold clear well</l>
<l rend="i0">Thalaba washed away his earthly stains,</l>
<l rend="i2">And bowed his face before the Lord,</l>
<l rend="i2">And fortified his soul with prayer.</l>
<l rend="i4">The while upon the rock</l>
<l rend="i4">Stood the celestial Bird,</l>
<l rend="i0">And pondering all the perils he must pass,</l>
<l rend="i2">With a mild melancholy eye</l>
<l rend="i4">Beheld the youth beloved.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">And lo! beneath yon lonely pine, the sledge....</l>
<l rend="i2">And there they stand the harnessed Dogs,</l>
<l rend="i2">Their wide eyes watching for the youth,</l>
<l rend="i0">Their ears erected turned towards his way.</l>
<l rend="i2">They were lean as lean might be,</l>
<l rend="i2">Their furrowed ribs rose prominent,</l>
<l rend="i2">And they were black from head to foot,</l>
<l rend="i2">Save a white line on every breast</l>
<l rend="i4">Curved like the crescent moon.</l>
<l rend="i2">And he is seated in the sledge,</l>
<l rend="i2">His arms are folded on his breast,</l>
<l rend="i4">The bird is on his knees;</l>
<l rend="i2">There is fear in the eyes of the Dogs,</l>
<l rend="i2">There is fear in their pitiful moan,</l>
<l rend="i4">And now they turn their heads,</l>
<l rend="i4">And seeing him there, Away!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">The Youth with the start of their speed</l>
<l rend="i2">Falls back to the bar of the sledge,</l>
<l rend="i0">His hair floats straight in the stream of the wind</l>
<l rend="i2">Like the weeds in the running brook.</l>
<l rend="i2">They wind with speed the upward way,</l>
<l rend="i2">An icey path thro' rocks of ice,</l>
<l rend="i2">His eye is at the summit now,</l>
<l rend="i2">And thus far all is dangerless,</l>
<l rend="i4">And now upon the height</l>
<l rend="i4">The black Dogs pause and pant,</l>
<l rend="i2">They turn their eyes to Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i4">As if to plead for pity,</l>
<l rend="i4">They moan and moan with fear.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Once more away! and now</l>
<l rend="i4">The long descent is seen,</l>
<l rend="i4">A long, long, narrow path.</l>
<l rend="i2">Ice-rocks aright and hills of snow,</l>
<l rend="i2">Aleft the giddy precipice.</l>
<l rend="i2">Be firm, be firm, O Thalaba!</l>
<l rend="i4">One motion now, one bend,</l>
<l rend="i4">And on the crags below</l>
<l rend="i0">Thy shattered flesh will harden in the frost.</l>
<l rend="i2">Why howl the Dogs so mournfully?</l>
<l rend="i2">And wherefore does the blood flow fast</l>
<l rend="i2">All purple o'er their sable hair?</l>
<l rend="i2">His arms are folded on his breast,</l>
<l rend="i4">Nor scourge nor goad has he,</l>
<l rend="i4">No hand appears to strike,</l>
<l rend="i4">No sounding lash is heard:</l>
<l rend="i2">But piteously they moan and moan</l>
<l rend="i4">And track their way with blood.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">And lo! on yonder height</l>
<l rend="i4">A giant Fiend aloft</l>
<l rend="i0">Waits to thrust down the tottering Avalanche!</l>
<l rend="i2">If Thalaba looks back he dies,</l>
<l rend="i2">The motion of fear is death.</l>
<l rend="i2">On ... on ... with swift and steady pace</l>
<l rend="i4">Adown that dreadful way!</l>
<l rend="i2">The youth is firm, the Dogs are fleet,</l>
<l rend="i4">The Sledge goes rapidly,</l>
<l rend="i2">The thunder of the avalanche</l>
<l rend="i4">Re-echoes far behind.</l>
<l rend="i2">On ... on ... with swift and steady pace</l>
<l rend="i4">Adown that dreadful way!</l>
<l rend="i2">The Dogs are fleet, the way is steep</l>
<l rend="i4">The Sledge goes rapidly,</l>
<l rend="i4">They reach the plain below.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">A wide, wide plain, all desolate,</l>
<l rend="i4">Nor tree, nor bush, nor herb!</l>
<l rend="i2">On go the Dogs with rapid step,</l>
<l rend="i2">The Sledge slides after rapidly,</l>
<l rend="i4">And now the Sun went down.</l>
<l rend="i2">They stopt and looked at Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i4">The Youth performed his prayer;</l>
<l rend="i2">They knelt beside him as he prayed</l>
<l rend="i4">They turned their heads to Mecca</l>
<l rend="i4">And tears ran down their cheeks.</l>
<l rend="i2">Then down they laid them in the snow</l>
<l rend="i4">As close as they could lie,</l>
<l rend="i4">They laid them down and slept.</l>
<l rend="i4">And backward in the sledge</l>
<l rend="i4">The Adventurer laid him down,</l>
<l rend="i2">There peacefully slept Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i2">And the Green Bird of Paradise</l>
<l rend="i4">Lay in his bosom warm.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">The Dogs awoke him at the dawn,</l>
<l rend="i4">They knelt and wept again;</l>
<l rend="i2">Then rapidly they journeyed on,</l>
<l rend="i2">And still the plain was desolate,</l>
<l rend="i4">Nor tree, nor bush, nor herb!</l>
<l rend="i2">And ever at the hour of prayer</l>
<l rend="i4">They stopt, and knelt, and wept;</l>
<l rend="i2">And still that green and graceful Bird</l>
<l rend="i2">Was as a friend to him by day,</l>
<l rend="i2">And ever when at night he slept</l>
<l rend="i4">Lay in his bosom warm.</l>
<l rend="i2">In that most utter solitude</l>
<l rend="i4">It cheered his heart to hear</l>
<l rend="i4">Her soft and soothing voice;</l>
<l rend="i4">Her voice was soft and sweet,</l>
<l rend="i2">It swelled not with the blackbird's thrill,</l>
<l rend="i0">Nor warbled rich like the dear bird, that holds</l>
<l rend="i4">The solitary man</l>
<l rend="i0">A loiterer in his thoughtful walk at eve;</l>
<l rend="i2">But if no overflowing joy</l>
<l rend="i2">Spake in its tones of tenderness</l>
<l rend="i4">They soothed the softened soul.</l>
<l rend="i2">Her bill was not the beak of blood;</l>
<l rend="i0">There was a human meaning in her eye,</l>
<l rend="i0">Its mild affection fixed on Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i4">Woke wonder while he gazed</l>
<l rend="i0">And made her dearer for the mystery.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Oh joy! the signs of life appear,</l>
<l rend="i4">The first and single Fir</l>
<l rend="i0">That on the limits of the living world</l>
<l rend="i4">Strikes in the ice its roots.</l>
<l rend="i2">Another, and another now;</l>
<l rend="i2">And now the Larch that flings its arms</l>
<l rend="i2">Down arching like the falling wave;</l>
<l rend="i2">And now the Aspin's scattered leaves</l>
<l rend="i2">Grey glitter on the moveless twig;</l>
<l rend="i2">The Poplar's varying verdure now,</l>
<l rend="i2">And now the Birch so beautiful,</l>
<l rend="i4">Light as a Lady's plumes.</l>
<l rend="i2">Oh joy! the signs of life! the Deer</l>
<l rend="i2">Hath left his slot beside the way;</l>
<l rend="i2">The little Ermine now is seen</l>
<l rend="i4">White wanderer of the snow;</l>
<l rend="i2">And now from yonder pines they hear</l>
<l rend="i2">The clatter of the Grouse's wings:</l>
<l rend="i2">And now the snowy Owl pursues</l>
<l rend="i2">The Traveller's sledge in hope of food;</l>
<l rend="i2">And hark! the rosy-breasted bird</l>
<l rend="i4">The Throstle of sweet song!</l>
<l rend="i2">Joy! joy! the winter-wilds are left!</l>
<l rend="i2">Green bushes now and greener grass,</l>
<l rend="i2">Red thickets here all berry-bright,</l>
<l rend="i4">And here the lovely flowers!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">When the last morning of their way arrived,</l>
<l rend="i4">After the early prayer,</l>
<l rend="i2">The Green Bird fixed on Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i2">A sad and supplicating eye,</l>
<l rend="i2">And with a human voice she spake,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Servant of God, I leave thee now.</l>
<l rend="i2">"If rightly I have guided thee,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Give me the boon I beg!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"O gentle Bird," quoth Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Guide and companion of my dangerous way,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Friend and sole solace of my solitude,</l>
<l rend="i0">"How can I pay thee benefits like these!</l>
<l rend="i2">"Ask what thou wilt that I can give,</l>
<l rend="i2">"O gentle Bird, the poor return</l>
<l rend="i4">"Will leave me debtor still!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"Son of Hodeirah!" she replied,</l>
<l rend="i0">"When thou shalt see an Old Man crushed beneath</l>
<l rend="i0">"The burthen of his earthly punishment,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Forgive him, Thalaba!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Yea, send a prayer to God on his behalf!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">A flush o'erspread the young Destroyer's cheek,</l>
<l rend="i2">He turned his eye towards the Bird</l>
<l rend="i0">As if in half repentance; for he thought</l>
<l rend="i0">Of Okba; and his Father's dying groan</l>
<l rend="i0">Came on his memory. The celestial Bird</l>
<l rend="i4">Saw and renewed her speech.</l>
<l rend="i0">"O Thalaba, if she who in thine arms</l>
<l rend="i0">"Received the dagger-blow and died for thee,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Deserve one kind remembrance ... save, O save</l>
<l rend="i0">"The Father that she loved from endless death!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Laila! and is it thou?" the youth replied:</l>
<l rend="i0">"What is there that I durst refuse to thee?</l>
<l rend="i0">"This is no time to harbour in my heart</l>
<l rend="i0">"One evil thought ... here I put off revenge,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The last rebellious feeling ... be it so!</l>
<l rend="i0">"God grant to me the pardon that I need</l>
<l rend="i4">"As I do pardon him!</l>
<l rend="i2">"But who am I that I should save</l>
<l rend="i4">"The sinful soul alive?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Enough!" said Laila. "When the hour shall come</l>
<l rend="i2">"Remember me! my task is done.</l>
<l rend="i2">"We meet again in Paradise!"</l>
<l rend="i0">She said and shook her wings, and up she soared</l>
<l rend="i0">With arrow-swiftness thro' the heights of Heaven.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">His aching eye pursued her path,</l>
<l rend="i2">When starting onward went the Dogs,</l>
<l rend="i2">More rapidly they hurried on</l>
<l rend="i4">In hope of near repose.</l>
<l rend="i2">It was the early morning yet</l>
<l rend="i2">When by the well-head of a brook</l>
<l rend="i4">They stopt, their journey done.</l>
<l rend="i2">The spring was clear, the water deep,</l>
<l rend="i2">A venturous man were he and rash</l>
<l rend="i4">That should have probed its depths,</l>
<l rend="i2">For all its loosened bed below</l>
<l rend="i4">Heaved strangely up and down,</l>
<l rend="i2">And to and fro, from side to side</l>
<l rend="i4">It heaved, and waved, and tossed,</l>
<l rend="i4">And yet the depths were clear,</l>
<l rend="i2">And yet no ripple wrinkled o'er</l>
<l rend="i4">The face of that fair Well.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">And on that Well so strange and fair</l>
<l rend="i4">A little boat there lay,</l>
<l rend="i2">Without on oar, without a sail,</l>
<l rend="i2">One only seat it had, one seat</l>
<l rend="i2">As if for only Thalaba.</l>
<l rend="i2">And at the helm a Damsel stood</l>
<l rend="i2">A Damsel bright and bold of eye,</l>
<l rend="i2">Yet did a maiden modesty</l>
<l rend="i4">Adorn her fearless brow.</l>
<l rend="i2">She seemed sorrowful, but sure</l>
<l rend="i4">More beautiful for sorrow.</l>
<l rend="i2">To her the Dogs looked wistful up,</l>
<l rend="i4">And then their tongues were loosed,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Have we done well, O Mistress dear!</l>
<l rend="i4">"And shall our sufferings end?"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">The gentle Damsel made reply,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Poor Servants of the God I serve,</l>
<l rend="i2">"When all this witchery is destroyed</l>
<l rend="i4">"Your woes will end with mine.</l>
<l rend="i2">"A hope, alas! how long unknown!</l>
<l rend="i4">"This new adventurer gives:</l>
<l rend="i2">"Now God forbid that he, like you,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Should perish for his fears!</l>
<l rend="i2">"Poor Servants of the God I serve</l>
<l rend="i4">"Wait ye the event in peace."</l>
<l rend="i0">A deep and total slumber as she spake</l>
<l rend="i0">Seized them. Sleep on, poor sufferers! be at rest!</l>
<l rend="i0">Ye wake no more to anguish. Ye have borne</l>
<l rend="i0">The Chosen, the Destroyer! soon his hand</l>
<l rend="i4">Shall strike the efficient blow,</l>
<l rend="i0">Soon shaking off your penal forms shall ye</l>
<l rend="i0">With songs of joy amid the Eden groves</l>
<l rend="i4">Hymn the Deliverer's praise!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Then did the Damsel say to Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i2">"The morn is young, the Sun is fair</l>
<l rend="i2">"And pleasantly thro' pleasant banks</l>
<l rend="i4">"The quiet brook flows on....</l>
<l rend="i4">"Wilt thou embark with me?</l>
<l rend="i2">"Thou knowest not the water's way,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Think Stranger well! and night must come,...</l>
<l rend="i4">"Wilt thou embark with me?</l>
<l rend="i2">"Thro' fearful perils thou must pass,...</l>
<l rend="i2">"Stranger, the oppressed ask thine aid!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Thou wilt embark with me!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">She smiled in tears upon the youth,...</l>
<l rend="i2">What heart were his who could gainsay</l>
<l rend="i4">That melancholy smile?</l>
<l rend="i2">"Sail on, sail on," quoth Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Sail on, in Allah's name!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">He sate him on the single seat,</l>
<l rend="i4">The little boat moved on.</l>
<l rend="i2">Thro' pleasant banks the quiet brook</l>
<l rend="i4">Went winding pleasantly;</l>
<l rend="i2">By fragrant fir groves now it past,</l>
<l rend="i4">And now thro' alder-shores,</l>
<l rend="i2">Thro' green and fertile meadows now</l>
<l rend="i4">It silently ran by.</l>
<l rend="i2">The flag-flower blossomed on its side,</l>
<l rend="i4">The willow tresses waved,</l>
<l rend="i2">The flowing current furrowed round</l>
<l rend="i2">The water-lilly's floating leaf,</l>
<l rend="i2">The fly of green and gauzy wing</l>
<l rend="i4">Fell sporting down its course.</l>
<l rend="i2">And grateful to the voyager</l>
<l rend="i2">The freshness of the running stream,</l>
<l rend="i4">The murmur round the prow.</l>
<l rend="i2">The little boat falls rapidly</l>
<l rend="i4">Adown the rapid brook.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">But many a silent spring meantime,</l>
<l rend="i4">And many a rivulet</l>
<l rend="i4">Had swoln the growing brook,</l>
<l rend="i2">And when the southern Sun began</l>
<l rend="i2">To wind the downward way of heaven,</l>
<l rend="i2">It ran a river deep and wide</l>
<l rend="i4">Thro' banks that widened still.</l>
<l rend="i2">Then once again the Damsel spake,</l>
<l rend="i2">"The stream is strong, the river broad,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Wilt thou go on with me?</l>
<l rend="i2">"The day is fair but night must come....</l>
<l rend="i4">"Wilt thou go on with me?</l>
<l rend="i2">"Far far away the mourner's eye</l>
<l rend="i2">"Is watching; for our little boat....</l>
<l rend="i4">"Thou wilt go on with me!"</l>
<l rend="i2">"Sail on, sail on," quoth Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Sail on, in Allah's name!"</l>
<l rend="i2">The little boat falls rapidly</l>
<l rend="i4">Adown the river-stream.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">A broader and a broader stream.</l>
<l rend="i4">That rocked the little boat!</l>
<l rend="i2">The Cormorant stands upon its shoals,</l>
<l rend="i4">His black and dripping wings</l>
<l rend="i4">Half opened to the wind.</l>
<l rend="i2">The Sun goes down, the crescent Moon</l>
<l rend="i2">Is brightening in the firmament;</l>
<l rend="i4">And what is yonder roar</l>
<l rend="i2">That sinking now and swelling now,</l>
<l rend="i4">But roaring, roaring still,</l>
<l rend="i4">Still louder, louder, grows?</l>
<l rend="i2">The little boat falls rapidly</l>
<l rend="i4">Adown the rapid tide,</l>
<l rend="i4">The Moon is bright above,</l>
<l rend="i0">And the wide Ocean opens on their way!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Then did the Damsel speak again</l>
<l rend="i4">"Wilt thou go on with me?</l>
<l rend="i2">"The Moon is bright, the sea is calm</l>
<l rend="i2">"And I know well the ocean-paths;...</l>
<l rend="i4">"Wilt thou go on with me?</l>
<l rend="i2">"Deliverer! yes! thou dost not fear!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Thou wilt go on with me!"</l>
<l rend="i2">"Sail on, sail on!" quoth Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i4">"Sail on, in Allah's name!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">The Moon is bright, the sea is calm,</l>
<l rend="i2">The little boat rides rapidly</l>
<l rend="i4">Across the ocean waves;</l>
<l rend="i2">The line of moonlight on the deep</l>
<l rend="i2">Still follows as they voyage on;</l>
<l rend="i4">The winds are motionless;</l>
<l rend="i2">The gentle waters gently part</l>
<l rend="i4">In murmurs round the prow.</l>
<l rend="i2">He looks above, he looks around,</l>
<l rend="i2">The boundless heaven, the boundless sea,</l>
<l rend="i2">The crescent moon, the little boat,</l>
<l rend="i4">Nought else above, below.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">The Moon is sunk, a dusky grey</l>
<l rend="i4">Spreads o'er the Eastern sky,</l>
<l rend="i4">The Stars grow pale and paler;</l>
<l rend="i2">Oh beautiful! the godlike Sun</l>
<l rend="i4">Is rising o'er the sea!</l>
<l rend="i2">Without an oar, without a sail</l>
<l rend="i2">The little boat rides rapidly;...</l>
<l rend="i2">Is that a cloud that skirts the sea?</l>
<l rend="i4">There is no cloud in heaven!</l>
<l rend="i2">And nearer now, and darker now....</l>
<l rend="i4">It is ... it is ... the Land!</l>
<l rend="i2">For yonder are the rocks that rise</l>
<l rend="i4">Dark in the reddening morn,</l>
<l rend="i2">For loud around their hollow base</l>
<l rend="i4">The surges rage and roar.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">The little boat rides rapidly,</l>
<l rend="i2">And now with shorter toss it heaves</l>
<l rend="i4">Upon the heavier swell;</l>
<l rend="i4">And now so near they see</l>
<l rend="i2">The shelves and shadows of the cliff,</l>
<l rend="i4">And the low-lurking rocks</l>
<l rend="i2">O'er whose black summits hidden-half</l>
<l rend="i4">The shivering billows burst.</l>
<l rend="i0">And nearer now they feel the breaker's spray.</l>
<l rend="i0">Then spake the Damsel, "yonder is our path</l>
<l rend="i4">"Beneath the cavern arch.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Now is the ebb, and till the ocean-flow</l>
<l rend="i2">"We cannot over-ride the rocks.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Go thou and on the shore</l>
<l rend="i0">"Perform thy last ablutions, and with prayer</l>
<l rend="i0">"Strengthen thy heart.... I too have need to pray."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">She held the helm with steady hand</l>
<l rend="i4">Amid the stronger waves,</l>
<l rend="i4">Thro' surge and surf she drove,</l>
<l rend="i4">The adventurer leapt to land.</l></lg>
</div>

<div type="book"><head>THE TWELFTH BOOK.</head>
<lg>
<l rend="i0">Then Thalaba drew off Abdaldar's ring,</l>
<l rend="i0">And cast it in the sea, and cried aloud,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Thou art my shield, my trust, my hope, O God!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Behold and guard me now,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Thou who alone canst save.</l>
<l rend="i0">"If from my childhood up, I have looked on</l>
<l rend="i0">"With exultation to my destiny,</l>
<l rend="i0">"If, in the hour of anguish, I have felt</l>
<l rend="i0">"The justice of the hand that chastened me,</l>
<l rend="i0">"If, of all selfish passions purified,</l>
<l rend="i0">"I go to work thy will, and from the world</l>
<l rend="i4">"Root up the ill-doing race,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Lord! let not thou the weakness of my arm</l>
<l rend="i4">"Make vain the enterprize!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">The Sun was rising all magnificent,</l>
<l rend="i0">Ocean and Heaven rejoicing in his beams.</l>
<l rend="i4">And now had Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i0">Performed his last ablutions, and he stood</l>
<l rend="i2">And gazed upon the little boat</l>
<l rend="i4">Riding the billows near,</l>
<l rend="i0">Where, like a sea-bird breasting the broad waves,</l>
<l rend="i2">It rose and fell upon the surge;</l>
<l rend="i0">Till from the glitterance of the sunny main</l>
<l rend="i4">He turned his aching eyes,</l>
<l rend="i0">And then upon the beach he laid him down</l>
<l rend="i4">And watched the rising tide.</l>
<l rend="i0">He did not pray, he was not calm for prayer;</l>
<l rend="i0">His spirit troubled with tumultuous hope</l>
<l rend="i4">Toiled with futurity.</l>
<l rend="i2">His brain, with busier workings, felt</l>
<l rend="i0">The roar and raving of the restless sea,</l>
<l rend="i0">The boundless waves that rose and rolled and rocked;</l>
<l rend="i4">The everlasting sound</l>
<l rend="i0">Opprest him, and the heaving infinite,</l>
<l rend="i4">He closed his lids for rest.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Meantime with fuller reach and stronger swell</l>
<l rend="i4">Wave after wave advanced;</l>
<l rend="i0">Each following billow lifted the last foam</l>
<l rend="i0">That trembled on the sand with rainbow hues;</l>
<l rend="i0">The living flower, that, rooted to the rock,</l>
<l rend="i2">Late from the thinner element</l>
<l rend="i0">Shrunk down within its purple stem to sleep,</l>
<l rend="i2">Now feels the water, and again</l>
<l rend="i4">Awakening blossoms out</l>
<l rend="i4">All its green anther-necks.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Was there a Spirit in the gale</l>
<l rend="i4">That fluttered o'er his cheek?</l>
<l rend="i0">For it came on him like the gentle sun</l>
<l rend="i0">That plays and dallies o'er the night-closed flower,</l>
<l rend="i0">And woos it to unfold anew to joy;</l>
<l rend="i0">For it came on him as the dews of eve</l>
<l rend="i2">Descend with healing and with life</l>
<l rend="i4">Upon the summer mead;</l>
<l rend="i0">Or liker the first sound of seraph song</l>
<l rend="i4">And Angel hail, to him</l>
<l rend="i0">Whose latest sense had shuddered at the groan</l>
<l rend="i0">Of anguish, kneeling by his death bed-side.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">He starts and gazes round to seek</l>
<l rend="i0">The certain presence. "Thalaba!" exclaimed</l>
<l rend="i4">The Voice of the Unseen;...</l>
<l rend="i0">"Father of my Oneiza!" he replied,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And have thy years been numbered? art thou too</l>
<l rend="i2">"Among the Angels?" "Thalaba!"</l>
<l rend="i0">A second and a dearer voice repeats,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Go in the favour of the Lord</l>
<l rend="i4">"My Thalaba go on!</l>
<l rend="i0">"My husband. I have drest our bower of bliss.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Go and perform the work,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Let me not longer suffer hope in heaven!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">He turned an eager glance towards the sea,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Come!" quoth the Damsel, and she drove</l>
<l rend="i4">Her little boat to land.</l>
<l rend="i2">Impatient thro' the rising wave</l>
<l rend="i4">He rushed to meet its way,</l>
<l rend="i0">His eye was bright, his cheek was flushed with joy.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Hast thou had comfort in thy prayers?" she cried,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Yea," answered Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i0">"A heavenly visitation." "God be praised!"</l>
<l rend="i0">She uttered, "then I do not hope in vain!"</l>
<l rend="i2">And her voice trembled, and her lips</l>
<l rend="i4">Quivered, and tears ran down.</l>
<l rend="i2">"Stranger," quoth she, "in years long past</l>
<l rend="i4">"Was one who vowed himself</l>
<l rend="i2">"The Champion of the Lord like thee</l>
<l rend="i4">"Against the race of Hell.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Young was he, as thyself,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Gentle, and yet so brave!</l>
<l rend="i4">"A lion-hearted man.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Shame on me, Stranger! in the arms of love</l>
<l rend="i0">"I held him from his calling, till the hour</l>
<l rend="i0">"Was past, and then the Angel who should else</l>
<l rend="i2">"Have crowned him with his glory-wreath,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Smote him in anger ... years and years are gone....</l>
<l rend="i0">"And in his place of penance he awaits</l>
<l rend="i0">"Thee the Deliverer, surely thou art he!</l>
<l rend="i2">"It was my righteous punishment</l>
<l rend="i0">"In the same youth unchanged and changeless love,</l>
<l rend="i0">"And fresh affliction and keen penitence</l>
<l rend="i0">"To abide the written hour when I should waft</l>
<l rend="i0">"The doomed Destroyer and Deliverer here.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Remember thou that thy success involves</l>
<l rend="i0">"No single fate, no common misery."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">As thus she spake, the entrance of the cave</l>
<l rend="i4">Darkened the boat below.</l>
<l rend="i4">Around them from their nests,</l>
<l rend="i4">The screaming sea-birds fled.</l>
<l rend="i4">Wondering at that strange shape</l>
<l rend="i0">Yet unalarmed at sight of living man,</l>
<l rend="i0">Unknowing of his sway and power misused;</l>
<l rend="i4">The clamours of their young</l>
<l rend="i4">Echoed in shriller yells</l>
<l rend="i0">That rung in wild discordance round the rock.</l>
<l rend="i4">And farther as they now advanced</l>
<l rend="i0">The dim reflection of the darkened day</l>
<l rend="i4">Grew fainter, and the dash</l>
<l rend="i0">Of the out-breakers deadened; farther yet</l>
<l rend="i4">And yet more faint the gleam,</l>
<l rend="i0">And there the waters at their utmost bound</l>
<l rend="i0">Silently rippled on the rising rock.</l>
<l rend="i0">They landed and advanced, and deeper in</l>
<l rend="i4">Two adamantine doors</l>
<l rend="i4">Closed up the cavern pass.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Reclining on the rock beside</l>
<l rend="i4">Sate a grey-headed man</l>
<l rend="i4">Watching an hour-glass by.</l>
<l rend="i4">To him the Damsel spake,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Is it the hour appointed?" the old man</l>
<l rend="i4">Nor answered her awhile,</l>
<l rend="i2">Nor lifted he his downward eye,</l>
<l rend="i4">For now the glass ran low,</l>
<l rend="i4">And like the days of age</l>
<l rend="i4">With speed perceivable,</l>
<l rend="i4">The latter sands descend:</l>
<l rend="i4">And now the last are gone.</l>
<l rend="i0">Then he looked up, and raised his arm, and smote</l>
<l rend="i4">The adamantine gates.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The gates of adamant</l>
<l rend="i4">Unfolding at the stroke</l>
<l rend="i0">Opened and gave the entrance. Then She turned</l>
<l rend="i4">To Thalaba and said</l>
<l rend="i4">"Go in the name of God!</l>
<l rend="i0">"I cannot enter,... I must wait the end</l>
<l rend="i4">"In hope and agony.</l>
<l rend="i2">"God and Mohammed prosper thee,</l>
<l rend="i4">"For thy sake and for ours!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">He tarried not,... he past</l>
<l rend="i0">The threshold, over which was no return.</l>
<l rend="i2">All earthly thoughts, all human hopes</l>
<l rend="i4">And passions now put off,</l>
<l rend="i4">He cast no backward glance</l>
<l rend="i4">Towards the gleam of day.</l>
<l rend="i4">There was a light within,</l>
<l rend="i0">A yellow light, as when the autumnal Sun</l>
<l rend="i4">Through travelling rain and mist</l>
<l rend="i4">Shines on the evening hills.</l>
<l rend="i2">Whether from central fires effused,</l>
<l rend="i2">Or if the sunbeams day by day,</l>
<l rend="i0">From earliest generations, there absorbed,</l>
<l rend="i0">Were gathering for the wrath-flame. Shade was</l>
<l rend="i4">In those portentous vaults;</l>
<l rend="i0">Crag overhanging, nor the column-rock</l>
<l rend="i4">Cast its dark outline there.</l>
<l rend="i0">For with the hot and heavy atmosphere</l>
<l rend="i0">The light incorporate, permeating all,</l>
<l rend="i0">Spread over all its equal yellowness.</l>
<l rend="i0">There was no motion in the lifeless air,</l>
<l rend="i2">He felt no stirring as he past</l>
<l rend="i4">Adown the long descent,</l>
<l rend="i0">He heard not his own footsteps on the rock</l>
<l rend="i0">That thro' the thick stagnation sent no sound.</l>
<l rend="i4">How sweet it were, he thought,</l>
<l rend="i4">To feel the flowing wind!</l>
<l rend="i4">With what a thirst of joy</l>
<l rend="i0">He should breathe in the open gales of heaven!</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Downward and downward still, and still the way,</l>
<l rend="i4">The long, long, way is safe.</l>
<l rend="i4">Is there no secret wile</l>
<l rend="i4">No lurking enemy?</l>
<l rend="i0">His watchful eye is on the wall of rock,...</l>
<l rend="i2">And warily he marks the roof</l>
<l rend="i4">And warily surveyed</l>
<l rend="i4">The path that lay before.</l>
<l rend="i0">Downward and downward still, and still the way,</l>
<l rend="i4">The long, long, way is safe;</l>
<l rend="i4">Rock only, the same light,</l>
<l rend="i4">The same dead atmosphere,</l>
<l rend="i0">And solitude, and silence like the grave.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">At length the long descent</l>
<l rend="i4">Ends on a precipice;</l>
<l rend="i0">No feeble ray entered its dreadful gulphs,</l>
<l rend="i4">For in the pit profound</l>
<l rend="i4">Black Darkness, utter Night,</l>
<l rend="i4">Repelled the hostile gleam,</l>
<l rend="i0">And o'er the surface the light atmosphere</l>
<l rend="i4">Floated and mingled not.</l>
<l rend="i0">Above the depth four overawning wings,</l>
<l rend="i4">Unplumed and huge and strong,</l>
<l rend="i4">Bore up a little car;</l>
<l rend="i0">Four living pinions, headless, bodyless,</l>
<l rend="i2">Sprung from one stem that branched below</l>
<l rend="i4">In four down-arching limbs,</l>
<l rend="i0">And clenched the car-rings endlong and aside</l>
<l rend="i4">With claws of griffin grasp.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">But not on these, the depths so terrible,</l>
<l rend="i0">The wonderous wings, fixed Thalaba his eye,</l>
<l rend="i4">For there upon the brink,</l>
<l rend="i0">With fiery fetters fastened to the rock,</l>
<l rend="i0">A man, a living man, tormented lay,</l>
<l rend="i0">The young Othatha; in the arms of love,</l>
<l rend="i0">He who had lingered out the auspicious hour</l>
<l rend="i4">Forgetful of his call.</l>
<l rend="i0">In shuddering pity Thalaba exclaimed</l>
<l rend="i0">"Servant of God, can I not succour thee?"</l>
<l rend="i2">He groaned and answered, "Son of Man,</l>
<l rend="i0">"I sinned and am tormented; I endure</l>
<l rend="i4">"In patience and in hope.</l>
<l rend="i0">"The hour that shall destroy the Race of Hell,</l>
<l rend="i4">"That hour shall set me free."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">"Is it not come?" quoth Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Yea! by this omen." And with fearless hand</l>
<l rend="i0">He grasped the burning fetters, "in the name</l>
<l rend="i4">"Of God!" and from the rock</l>
<l rend="i0">Rooted the rivets, and adown the gulph</l>
<l rend="i2">Hurled them. The rush of flames roared up,</l>
<l rend="i2">For they had kindled in their fall</l>
<l rend="i0">The deadly vapours of the pit profound,</l>
<l rend="i0">And Thalaba bent on and looked below.</l>
<l rend="i4">But vainly he explored</l>
<l rend="i4">The deep abyss of flame</l>
<l rend="i0">That sunk beyond the plunge of mortal eye,</l>
<l rend="i0">Now all ablaze as if infernal fires</l>
<l rend="i4">Illumed the world beneath.</l>
<l rend="i2">Soon was the poison-fuel spent,</l>
<l rend="i4">The flame grew pale and dim,</l>
<l rend="i0">And dimmer now it fades and now is quenched,</l>
<l rend="i4">And all again is dark,</l>
<l rend="i4">Save where the yellow air</l>
<l rend="i0">Enters a little in and mingles slow.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Meantime the freed Othatha clasped his knees</l>
<l rend="i2">And cried, "Deliverer!" struggling then</l>
<l rend="i0">With joyful hope, "and where is she," he cried,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Whose promised coming for so many a year...."</l>
<l rend="i4">"Go!" answered Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i4">"She waits thee at the gates."</l>
<l rend="i2">"And in thy triumph," he replied,</l>
<l rend="i0">"There thou wilt join us?" the Deliverer's eye</l>
<l rend="i2">Glanced on the abyss, way else was none....</l>
<l rend="i2">The depth was unascendable.</l>
<l rend="i4">"Await not me," he cried,</l>
<l rend="i0">"My path hath been appointed, go ... embark!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Return to life,... live happy!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">OTHATHA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i12">But thy name,...</l><l rend="i0">That thro' the nations we may blazon it,</l>
<l rend="i0">That we may bless thee.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i8">THALABA.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i10">Bless the Merciful!</l></lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Then Thalaba pronounced the name of God</l>
<l rend="i4">And leapt into the car.</l>
<l rend="i4">Down, down, it sunk,... down down....</l>
<l rend="i4">He neither breathes nor sees;</l>
<l rend="i2">His eyes are closed for giddiness</l>
<l rend="i2">His breath is sinking with the fall.</l>
<l rend="i2">The air that yields beneath the car</l>
<l rend="i4">Inflates the wings above.</l>
<l rend="i4">Down ... down ... a mighty depth!...</l>
<l rend="i0">And was the Simorgh with the Powers of ill</l>
<l rend="i4">Associate to destroy?</l>
<l rend="i2">And was that lovely mariner</l>
<l rend="i4">A fiend as false as fair?</l>
<l rend="i4">For still he sinks down ... down....</l>
<l rend="i2">But ever the uprushing wind</l>
<l rend="i4">Inflates the wings above,</l>
<l rend="i4">And still the struggling wings</l>
<l rend="i4">Repel the rushing wind.</l>
<l rend="i4">Down ... down ... and now it strikes.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">He stands and totters giddily,</l>
<l rend="i4">All objects round, awhile,</l>
<l rend="i4">Float dizzy on his sight.</l>
<l rend="i0">Collected soon he gazes for the way.</l>
<l rend="i0">There was a distant light that led his search;</l>
<l rend="i4">The torch a broader blaze,</l>
<l rend="i0">The unpruned taper flames a longer flame,</l>
<l rend="i0">But this was fierce as is the noon-tide sun,</l>
<l rend="i0">So in the glory of its rays intense</l>
<l rend="i4">It quivered with green glow.</l>
<l rend="i4">Beyond was all unseen,</l>
<l rend="i4">No eye could penetrate</l>
<l rend="i0">That unendurable excess of light.</l>
<l rend="i0">It veiled no friendly form, thought Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i4">And wisely did he deem,</l>
<l rend="i0">For at the threshold of the rocky door,</l>
<l rend="i0">Hugest and fiercest of his kind accurst,</l>
<l rend="i2">Fit warden of the sorcery gate</l>
<l rend="i4">A rebel Afreet lay.</l>
<l rend="i0">He scented the approach of human food</l>
<l rend="i0">And hungry hope kindled his eye of flame.</l>
<l rend="i0">Raising his hand to save the dazzled sense</l>
<l rend="i4">Onward held Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i0">And lifted still at times a rapid glance.</l>
<l rend="i4">Till, the due distance gained,</l>
<l rend="i4">With head abased, he laid</l>
<l rend="i4">The arrow in its rest.</l>
<l rend="i0">With steady effort and knit forehead then,</l>
<l rend="i4">Full on the painful light</l>
<l rend="i0">He fixed his aching eye, and loosed the bow.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">An anguish yell ensued,</l>
<l rend="i0">And sure no human voice had scope or power</l>
<l rend="i4">For that prodigious shriek</l>
<l rend="i0">Whose pealing echoes thundered up the rock.</l>
<l rend="i4">Dim grew the dying light,</l>
<l rend="i0">But Thalaba leapt onward to the doors</l>
<l rend="i4">Now visible beyond,</l>
<l rend="i0">And while the Afreet warden of the way</l>
<l rend="i0">Was writhing with his death-pangs, over him</l>
<l rend="i4">Sprung and smote the stony doors,</l>
<l rend="i0">And bade them in the name of God give way.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">The dying Fiend beneath him at that name</l>
<l rend="i4">Tossed in worse agony,</l>
<l rend="i0">And the rocks shuddered, and the rocky doors</l>
<l rend="i0">Rent at the voice asunder. Lo ... within....</l>
<l rend="i4">The Teraph and the fire,</l>
<l rend="i2">And Khawla, and in mail complete</l>
<l rend="i4">Mohareb for the strife.</l>
<l rend="i2">But Thalaba with numbing force</l>
<l rend="i2">Smites his raised arm, and rushes by,</l>
<l rend="i0">For now he sees the fire amid whose flames</l>
<l rend="i0">On the white ashes of Hodeirah lies</l>
<l rend="i4">Hodeirah's holy Sword.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">He rushes to the fire,</l>
<l rend="i4">Then Khawla met the youth</l>
<l rend="i0">And leapt upon him, and with clinging arms</l>
<l rend="i0">Clasps him, and calls Mohareb now to aim</l>
<l rend="i0">The effectual vengeance. O fool! fool! he sees</l>
<l rend="i0">His Father's Sword, and who shall bar his way?</l>
<l rend="i0">Who stand against the fury of that arm</l>
<l rend="i4">That spurns her to the earth?</l>
<l rend="i0">She rises half, she twists around his knees,</l>
<l rend="i2">A moment ... and he vainly strives</l>
<l rend="i4">To shake her from her hold,</l>
<l rend="i0">Impatient then into her cursed breast</l>
<l rend="i4">He stamps his crushing heel,</l>
<l rend="i0">And from her body, heaving now in death</l>
<l rend="i4">Springs forward to the Sword.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">The co-existent flame</l>
<l rend="i0">Knew the Destroyer; it encircled him,</l>
<l rend="i0">Rolled up his robe and gathered round his head,</l>
<l rend="i0">Condensing to intenser splendour there,</l>
<l rend="i0">His crown of glory and his light of life</l>
<l rend="i4">Hovered the irradiate wreath.</l>
<l rend="i0">The moment Thalaba had laid his hand</l>
<l rend="i4">Upon his Father's Sword,</l>
<l rend="i0">The Living Image in the inner cave</l>
<l rend="i0">Smote the Round Altar. The Domdaniel rocked</l>
<l rend="i4">Thro' all its thundering vaults;</l>
<l rend="i0">Over the surface of the reeling Earth</l>
<l rend="i4">The alarum shock was felt:</l>
<l rend="i0">The Sorcerer brood, all, all, where'er dispersed,</l>
<l rend="i0">Perforce obeyed the summons; all, they came</l>
<l rend="i4">Compelled by Hell and Heaven,</l>
<l rend="i4">By Hell compelled to keep</l>
<l rend="i4">Their baptism-covenant,</l>
<l rend="i2">And with the union of their strength</l>
<l rend="i0">Oppose the common danger; forced by Heaven</l>
<l rend="i4">To share the common doom.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Vain are all spells! the Destroyer</l>
<l rend="i4">Treads the Domdaniel floor.</l>
<l rend="i0">They crowd with human arms and human force</l>
<l rend="i4">To crush the single foe;</l>
<l rend="i4">Vain is all human force!</l>
<l rend="i4">He wields his Father's Sword,</l>
<l rend="i0">The vengeance of awakened Deity!</l>
<l rend="i0">But chief on Thalaba Mohareb prest,</l>
<l rend="i2">The language of the inspired Witch</l>
<l rend="i2">Announced one fatal blow for both,</l>
<l rend="i0">And desperate of self-safety, yet he hoped</l>
<l rend="i0">To serve the cause of Eblis, and uphold</l>
<l rend="i4">His empire true in death.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">Who shall withstand his way?</l>
<l rend="i0">Scattered before the sword of Thalaba</l>
<l rend="i4">The sorcerer throng recede</l>
<l rend="i0">And leave him space for combat. Wretched man</l>
<l rend="i0">What shall the helmet or the shield avail</l>
<l rend="i0">Against Almighty anger! wretched man,</l>
<l rend="i0">Too late Mohareb finds that he has chosen</l>
<l rend="i2">The evil part! he rears his shield</l>
<l rend="i4">To meet the Arabian's sword,...</l>
<l rend="i0">Under the edge of that fire-hardened steel</l>
<l rend="i2">The shield falls severed; his cold arm</l>
<l rend="i4">Rings with the jarring blow,...</l>
<l rend="i4">He lifts his scymetar,</l>
<l rend="i0">A second stroke, and lo! the broken hilt</l>
<l rend="i4">Hangs from his palsied hand!</l>
<l rend="i2">And now he bleeds! and now he flies!</l>
<l rend="i0">And fain would hide himself amid the throng,</l>
<l rend="i2">But they feel the sword of Hodeirah,</l>
<l rend="i2">But they also fly from the ruin!</l>
<l rend="i2">And hasten to the inner cave,</l>
<l rend="i4">And fall all fearfully</l>
<l rend="i2">Around the Giant Idol's feet,</l>
<l rend="i0">Seeking salvation from the Power they served.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">It was a Living Image, by the art</l>
<l rend="i0">Of magic hands of flesh and bones composed,</l>
<l rend="i0">And human blood thro' veins and arteries</l>
<l rend="i0">That flowed with vital action. In the shape</l>
<l rend="i4">Of Eblis it was made,</l>
<l rend="i2">Its stature such and such its strength</l>
<l rend="i2">As when among the Sons of God</l>
<l rend="i0">Pre-eminent, he raised his radiant head,</l>
<l rend="i2">Prince of the Morning. On his brow</l>
<l rend="i2">A coronet of meteor flames,</l>
<l rend="i4">Flowing in points of light.</l>
<l rend="i4">Self-poised in air before him,</l>
<l rend="i0">Hung the Round Altar, rolling like the World</l>
<l rend="i0">On its diurnal axis, like the World</l>
<l rend="i4">Checquered with sea and shore,</l>
<l rend="i4">The work of Demon art.</l>
<l rend="i0">For where the sceptre in the Idol's hand</l>
<l rend="i0">Touched the Round Altar, in its answering realm</l>
<l rend="i0">Earth felt the stroke, and Ocean rose in storms,</l>
<l rend="i0">And ruining Cities shaken from their seat</l>
<l rend="i4">Crushed all their habitants.</l>
<l rend="i0">His other arm was raised, and its spread palm</l>
<l rend="i4">Up-bore the ocean-weight</l>
<l rend="i0">Whose naked waters arched the sanctuary,</l>
<l rend="i4">Sole prop and pillar he.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i2">Fallen on the ground around his feet</l>
<l rend="i0">The Sorcerers lay. Mohareb's quivering arms</l>
<l rend="i4">Clung to the Idol's knees;</l>
<l rend="i4">The Idol's face was pale</l>
<l rend="i2">And calm in terror he beheld</l>
<l rend="i2">The approach of the Destroyer.</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Sure of his stroke, and therefore in pursuit</l>
<l rend="i0">Following, nor blind, nor hasty on his foe,</l>
<l rend="i0">Moved the Destroyer. Okba met his way,</l>
<l rend="i4">Of all that brotherhood</l>
<l rend="i0">He only fearless, miserable man,</l>
<l rend="i4">The one that had no hope.</l>
<l rend="i0">"On me, on me," the childless Sorcerer cried,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Let fall the weapon! I am he who stole</l>
<l rend="i0">"Upon the midnight of thy Father's tent,</l>
<l rend="i0">"This is the hand that pierced Hodeirah's heart,</l>
<l rend="i0">"That felt thy brethren's and thy sister's blood</l>
<l rend="i0">"Gush round the dagger-hilt. Let fall on me</l>
<l rend="i0">"The fated sword! the vengeance hour is come!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Destroyer, do thy work!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Nor wile, nor weapon, had the desperate wretch,</l>
<l rend="i2">He spread his bosom to the stroke.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Old man, I strike thee not!" said Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i0">"The evil thou hast done to me and mine</l>
<l rend="i2">"Brought its own bitter punishment.</l>
<l rend="i0">"For thy dear Daughter's sake I pardon thee,</l>
<l rend="i0">"As I do hope Heaven's pardon. For her sake</l>
<l rend="i0">"Repent while time is yet! thou hast my prayers</l>
<l rend="i0">"To aid thee; thou poor sinner, cast thyself</l>
<l rend="i0">"Upon the goodness of offended God!</l>
<l rend="i0">"I speak in Laila's name, and what if now</l>
<l rend="i0">"Thou canst not think to join in Paradise</l>
<l rend="i0">"Her spotless Spirit,... hath not Allah made</l>
<l rend="i0">"Al-Araf<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> in his wisdom? where the sight</l>
<l rend="i0">"Of Heaven shall kindle in the penitent</l>
<l rend="i0">"The strong and purifying fire of hope,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Till at the day of judgement he shall see</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Mercy-Gates unfold."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">The astonished man stood gazing as he spake,</l>
<l rend="i0">At length his heart was softened, and the tears</l>
<l rend="i4">Gushed, and he sobbed aloud.</l>
<l rend="i4">Then suddenly was heard</l>
<l rend="i0">The all-beholding Prophet's aweful voice,</l>
<l rend="i4">"Thou hast done well, my Servant!</l>
<l rend="i4">"Ask and receive thy reward!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i4">A deep and aweful joy</l>
<l rend="i0">Seemed to distend the heart of Thalaba;</l>
<l rend="i0">With arms in reverence crost upon his breast,</l>
<l rend="i0">Upseeking eyes suffused with transport-tears</l>
<l rend="i0">He answered to the Voice, "Prophet of God,</l>
<l rend="i2">"Holy, and good, and bountiful!</l>
<l rend="i0">"One only earthly wish have I, to work</l>
<l rend="i0">"Thy will, and thy protection grants me that.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Look on this Sorcerer! heavy are his crimes,</l>
<l rend="i0">"But infinite is mercy! if thy servant</l>
<l rend="i0">"Have now found favour in the sight of God,</l>
<l rend="i0">"Let him be touched with penitence, and save</l>
<l rend="i4">"His soul from utter death."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"The groans of penitence," replied the Voice</l>
<l rend="i4">"Never arise unheard!</l>
<l rend="i2">"But for thyself prefer the prayer,</l>
<l rend="i4">"The Treasure-house of Heaven</l>
<l rend="i4">"Is open to thy will."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">"Prophet of God!" then answered Thalaba,</l>
<l rend="i4">"I am alone on earth.</l>
<l rend="i0">"Thou knowest the secret wishes of my heart!</l>
<l rend="i0">"Do with me as thou wilt! thy will is best."</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">There issued forth no Voice to answer him,</l>
<l rend="i0">But lo! Hodeirah's Spirit comes to see</l>
<l rend="i0">His vengeance, and beside him, a pure form</l>
<l rend="i0">Of roseate light, the Angel mother hangs.</l>
<l rend="i0">"My Child, my dear, my glorious, blessed Child,</l>
<l rend="i0">"My promise is performed ... fufil thy work!"</l>
</lg><lg>
<l rend="i0">Thalaba knew that his death-hour was come,</l>
<l rend="i2">And on he leapt, and springing up,</l>
<l rend="i4">Into the Idol's heart</l>
<l rend="i4">Hilt-deep he drove the Sword.</l>
<l rend="i0">The Ocean-Vault fell in, and all were crushed.</l>
<l rend="i2">In the same moment at the gate</l>
<l rend="i0">Of Paradise, Oneiza's Houri-form</l>
<l rend="i0">Welcomed her Husband to eternal bliss.</l></lg>
