<h4>PREFACE.</h4>


<p>The Poem, which is here offered to the Public, does not pretend to
instruct by deep researches of reasoning; its aim is simply to amuse
by bringing distinctly to the imagination the beautiful and sublime
images of the operations of Nature in the order, as the Author
believes, in which the progressive course of time presented them.</p>

<p>The Deities of Egypt, and afterwards of Greece, and Rome, were derived
from men famous in those early times, as in the ages of hunting,
pasturage, and agriculture. The histories of some of their actions
recorded in Scripture, or celebrated in the heathen mythology, are
introduced, as the Author hopes, without impropriety into his account
of those remote periods of human society.</p>

<p>In the Eleusinian mysteries the philosophy of the works of Nature,
with the origin and progress of society, are believed to have been
taught by allegoric scenery explained by the Hierophant to the
initiated, which gave rise to the machinery of the following Poem.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p><a id="canto1_I" name="canto1_I"></a>I. By firm immutable immortal laws<br>
  Impress'd on Nature by the <span class="smcap">Great First Cause</span>,<br>
  Say, <span class="smcap">Muse</span>! how rose from elemental strife<br>
  Organic forms, and kindled into life;<br>
  How Love and Sympathy with potent charm<br>
  Warm the cold heart, the lifted hand disarm;<br>
  Allure with pleasures, and alarm with pains,<br>
  And bind Society in golden chains.</p>

<p><a id="canto1_9" name="canto1_9"></a>Four past eventful Ages then recite,<br>
  And give the fifth, new-born of Time, to light;                <span class="ralign">10</span><br>
  The silken tissue of their joys disclose,<br>
  Swell with deep chords the murmur of their woes;<br>
  <span class="pagenum"><a id="page004" name="page004"></a>(p. 004)</span> Their laws, their labours, and their loves proclaim,<br>
  And chant their virtues to the trump of Fame.</p>

<p><a id="canto1_15" name="canto1_15"></a><span class="smcap">Immortal Love!</span> who ere the morn of Time,<br>
  On wings outstretch'd, o'er Chaos hung sublime;<br>
  Warm'd into life the bursting egg of Night,<br>
  And gave young Nature to admiring Light!&mdash;<br>
  <span class="smcap">You!</span> whose wide arms, in soft embraces hurl'd<br>
  Round the vast frame, connect the whirling world!      <span class="ralign">20</span><br>
  Whether immers'd in day, the Sun your throne,<br>
  You gird the planets in your silver zone;<br>
  Or warm, descending on ethereal wing,<br>
  The Earth's cold bosom with the beams of spring;<br>
  Press drop to drop, to atom atom bind,<br>
  Link sex to sex, or rivet mind to mind;<br>
  Attend my song!&mdash;With rosy lips rehearse,<br>
  And with your polish'd arrows write my verse!&mdash;<br>
  So shall my lines soft-rolling eyes engage,<br>
  And snow-white fingers turn the volant page;      <span class="ralign">30</span><br>
  <span class="pagenum"><a id="page005" name="page005"></a>(p. 005)</span> The smiles of Beauty all my toils repay,<br>
  And youths and virgins chant the living lay.</p>

<p><a id="canto1_II" name="canto1_II"></a>II. <span class="smcap">Where Eden's</span> sacred bowers triumphant sprung,<br>
  By angels guarded, and by prophets sung,<br>
  Wav'd o'er the east in purple pride unfurl'd,<br>
  And rock'd the golden <a id="c1_l36" name="c1_l36"></a><a href="#canto1_l36">cradle of the World</a>;<br>
  <span class="pagenum"><a id="page006" name="page006"></a>(p. 006)</span> Four sparkling currents lav'd with wandering tides<br>
  Their velvet avenues, and flowery sides;<br>
  On sun-bright lawns unclad the Graces stray'd,<br>
  And guiltless Cupids haunted every glade;      <span class="ralign">40</span><br>
  Till the fair Bride, forbidden shades among,<br>
  Heard unalarm'd the Tempter's serpent-tongue;<br>
  Eyed the sweet fruit, the mandate disobey'd,<br>
  And her fond Lord with sweeter smiles betray'd.<br>
  Conscious awhile with throbbing heart he strove,<br>
  Spread his wide arms, and barter'd life for love!&mdash;<br>
  Now rocks on rocks, in savage grandeur roll'd,<br>
  Steep above steep, the blasted plains infold;<br>
  The incumbent crags eternal tempest shrouds,<br>
  And livid light'nings cleave the lambent clouds;      <span class="ralign">50</span><br>
  <span class="pagenum"><a id="page007" name="page007"></a>(p. 007)</span> Round the firm base loud-howling whirlwinds blow,<br>
  And sands in burning eddies dance below.</p>

<p>Hence ye profane!&mdash;the warring winds exclude<br>
  Unhallow'd throngs, that press with footstep rude;<br>
  But court the Muse's train with milder skies,<br>
  And call with softer voice the good and wise.<br>
  &mdash;Charm'd at her touch the opening wall divides,<br>
  And rocks of crystal form the polish'd sides;<br>
  Through the bright arch the Loves and Graces tread,<br>
  Innocuous thunders murmuring o'er their head;      <span class="ralign">60</span><br>
  Pair after pair, and tittering, as they pass,<br>
  View their fair features in the walls of glass;<br>
  Leave with impatient step the circling bourn,<br>
  And hear behind the closing rocks return.</p>

<p><a id="canto1_65" name="canto1_65"></a><span class="smcap">Here</span>, high in air, unconscious of the storm.<br>
  Thy temple, <span class="smcap">Nature</span>, rears it's mystic form;<br>

  Towers the vast fabric on the desert soil;<br>
  <span class="pagenum"><a id="page008" name="page008"></a>(p. 008)</span> O'er many a league the ponderous domes extend.<br>
  And deep in earth the ribbed vaults descend;      <span class="ralign">70</span><br>
  A thousand jasper steps with circling sweep<br>
  Lead the slow votary up the winding steep;<br>
  Ten thousand piers, now join'd and now aloof,<br>
  Bear on their branching arms the fretted roof.</p>

<p><a id="canto1_75" name="canto1_75"></a>Unnumber'd ailes connect unnumber'd halls,<br>
  And sacred symbols crowd the <a id="c1_l76" name="c1_l76"></a><a href="#canto1_l76">pictur'd walls</a>;<br>
  With pencil rude forgotten days design,<br>
  And arts, or empires, live in every line.<br>
  <span class="pagenum"><a id="page009" name="page009"></a>(p. 009)</span> While chain'd reluctant on the marble ground,<br>
  Indignant <span class="smcap">Time</span> reclines, by Sculpture bound;        <span class="ralign">80</span><br>
  And sternly bending o'er a scroll unroll'd,<br>
  Inscribes the future with his style of gold.<br>
  <a id="canto1_83" name="canto1_83"></a>&mdash;<a id="c1_l83" name="c1_l83"></a><a href="#canto1_l83">So erst, when <span class="smcap">Proteus</span></a> on the briny shore,<br>
  New forms assum'd of eagle, pard, or boar;<br>
  The wise <span class="smcap">Atrides</span> bound in sea-weed thongs<br>
  The changeful god amid his scaly throngs;<br>
  Till in deep tones his opening lips at last<br>
  Reluctant told the future and the past.</p>

<p><a id="canto1_89" name="canto1_89"></a><span class="smcap">Here</span> o'er piazza'd courts, and long arcades,<br>
  The bowers of <span class="smcap">Pleasure</span> root their waving shades;      <span class="ralign">90</span><br>
  Shed o'er the pansied moss a checker'd gloom,<br>
  Bend with new fruits, with flow'rs successive bloom.<br>
  <span class="pagenum"><a id="page010" name="page010"></a>(p. 010)</span> Pleas'd, their light limbs on beds of roses press'd,<br>
  In slight undress recumbent Beauties rest;<br>
  On tiptoe steps surrounding Graces move,<br>
  And gay Desires expand their wings above.</p>

<p><a id="canto1_97" name="canto1_97"></a><span class="smcap">Here</span> young <span class="smcap">Dione</span> arms her quiver'd Loves,<br>
  Schools her bright Nymphs, and practises her doves;<br>
  Calls round her laughing eyes in playful turns,<br>
  The glance that lightens, and the smile that burns;          <span class="ralign">100</span><br>
  Her dimpling cheeks with transient blushes dies,<br>
  Heaves her white bosom with seductive sighs;<br>
  Or moulds with rosy lips the magic words,<br>
  That bind the heart in adamantine cords.</p>

<p><a id="canto1_105" name="canto1_105"></a>Behind in twilight gloom with scowling mien<br>
  The demon <span class="smcap">Pain</span>, convokes his court unseen;<br>
  Whips, fetters, flames, pourtray'd on sculptur'd stone,<br>
  In dread festoons, adorn his ebon throne;<br>
  Each side a cohort of diseases stands,<br>
  And shudd'ring Fever leads the ghastly bands;               <span class="ralign">110</span><br>
  <span class="pagenum"><a id="page011" name="page011"></a>(p. 011)</span> O'er all Despair expands his raven wings,<br>
  And guilt-stain'd Conscience darts a thousand stings.</p>

<p><a id="canto1_113" name="canto1_113"></a>Deep-whelm'd beneath, in vast sepulchral caves,<br>
  <span class="smcap">Oblivion</span> dwells amid unlabell'd graves;<br>
  The storied tomb, the laurell'd bust o'erturns,<br>
  And shakes their ashes from the mould'ring urns.&mdash;<br>
  No vernal zephyr breathes, no sunbeams cheer,<br>
  Nor song, nor simper, ever enters here;<br>
  O'er the green floor, and round the dew-damp wall,<br>
  The slimy snail, and bloated lizard crawl;                   <span class="ralign">120</span><br>
  <a id="canto1_121" name="canto1_121"></a>While on white heaps of intermingled bones<br>
  The muse of <span class="smcap">Melancholy</span> sits and moans;<br>
  Showers her cold tears o'er Beauty's early wreck,<br>
  Spreads her pale arms, and bends her marble neck.</p>

<p><a id="canto1_125" name="canto1_125"></a>So in rude rocks, beside the Ægean wave,<br>
  <a id="c1_l126" name="c1_l126"></a><a href="#canto1_l126"><span class="smcap">Trophonius</span> scoop'd</a> his sorrow-sacred cave;<br>
  <span class="pagenum"><a id="page012" name="page012"></a>(p. 012)</span> Unbarr'd to pilgrim feet the brazen door,<br>
  And the sad sage returning smil'd no more.</p>

<p><a id="canto1_129" name="canto1_129"></a><span class="smcap">Shrin'd</span> in the midst majestic <span class="smcap">Nature</span> stands,<br>
  Extends o'er earth and sea her hundred hands;                <span class="ralign">130</span><br>
  Tower upon tower her beamy forehead crests,<br>
  And births unnumber'd milk her hundred breasts;<br>
  Drawn round her brows a lucid veil depends,<br>
  O'er her fine waist the purfled woof descends;<br>
  Her stately limbs the gather'd folds surround,<br>
  And spread their golden selvage on the ground.</p>

<p><a id="canto1_137" name="canto1_137"></a>From this first altar <a id="c1_l137" name="c1_l137"></a><a href="#canto1_l137">fam'd <span class="smcap">Eleusis</span> stole</a><br>

  &mdash;First in dim pomp before the astonish'd throng,<br>
  Silence, and Night, and Chaos, stalk'd along;<br>
  Dread scenes of Death, in nodding sables dress'd,<br>
  Froze the broad eye, and thrill'd the unbreathing breast.<br>
  Then the young Spring, with winged Zephyr, leads<br>
  The queen of Beauty to the blossom'd meads;<br>
  <span class="pagenum"><a id="page014" name="page014"></a>(p. 014)</span> Charm'd in her train admiring Hymen moves,<br>
  And tiptoe Graces hand in hand with Loves.<br>
  Next, while on pausing step the masked mimes<br>
  Enact the triumphs of forgotten times,                       <span class="ralign">150</span><br>
  Conceal from vulgar throngs the mystic truth,<br>
  Or charm with Wisdom's lore the initiate youth;<br>
  Each shifting scene, some patriot hero trod,<br>
  Some sainted beauty, or some saviour god.</p>

<p><a id="canto1_III" name="canto1_III"></a>III. Now rose in purple pomp the breezy dawn,<br>
  And crimson dew-drops trembled on the lawn;<br>
  Blaz'd high in air the temple's golden vanes,<br>
  And dancing shadows veer'd upon the plains.&mdash;<br>
  <a id="canto1_159" name="canto1_159"></a>Long trains of virgins from the sacred grove,<br>

  The graceful <span class="smcap">Hierophant</span>, and winged <span class="smcap">Muse</span>;<br>
  Onward they step around the stately piles,<br>
  O'er porcelain floors, through laqueated ailes,<br>
  Eye Nature's lofty and her lowly seats,<br>
  Her gorgeous palaces, and green retreats,<br>
  Pervade her labyrinths with unerring tread,<br>
  And leave for future guests a guiding thread.</p>

<p>First with fond gaze blue fields of air they sweep,<br>
  Or pierce the briny chambers of the deep;      <span class="ralign">10</span><br>
  Earth's burning line, and icy poles explore,<br>
  Her fertile surface, and her caves of ore;<br>

  Plays round the globe in one aerial mass,<br>
  Or fused with Hydrogen in ceaseless flow<br>
  Forms the wide waves, which foam and roll below.</p>

<p>Next with illumined hands through prisms bright<br>
  Pleased they untwist the sevenfold threads of light;<br>
  Or, bent in pencils by the lens, convey<br>
  To one bright point the silver hairs of Day.      <span class="ralign">20</span><br>
  Then mark how <a id="c3_l21" name="c3_l21"></a><a href="#canto3_l21">two electric streams</a> conspire<br>

  And give Torpedo his benumbing charm;<br>
  Or, through Galvanic chain-work as they pass,<br>
  Convert the kindling water into gas.</p>

<p>How at the poles opposing Ethers dwell,<br>
  Attract the quivering needle, or repel.<br>
  How Gravitation by immortal laws<br>
  Surrounding matter to a centre draws;      <span class="ralign">30</span><br>
  How Heat, pervading oceans, airs, and lands,<br>
  With force uncheck'd the mighty mass expands;<br>
  And last how born in elemental strife<br>
  Beam'd the first spark, and lighten'd into Life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page086" name="page086"></a>(p. 086)</span>   Now in sweet tones the inquiring Muse express'd<br>
  Her ardent wish; and thus the Fair address'd.<br>
  "Priestess of Nature! whose exploring sight<br>
  Pierces the realms of Chaos and of Night;<br>
  Of space unmeasured marks the first and last,<br>
  Of endless time the present, future, past;      <span class="ralign">40</span><br>

  With mind gigantic steps the puny Elf,<br>
  And weighs and measures all things but himself!"</p>

<p>The indulgent Beauty hears the grateful Muse,<br>
  Smiles on her pupil, and her task renews.      <span class="ralign">50</span><br>

SPONTANEOUS VITALITY OF MICROSCOPIC ANIMALS.</h4>

<p class="poem20">
  Hence without parent by spontaneous birth<br>
  Rise the first specks of animated earth.<br>
<span class="left50"><span class="smcap">Canto I.</span> l. 227.</span></p>


<p class="center p2"><i>Prejudices against this doctrine.</i></p>

<p>I. From the misconception of the ignorant or superstitious, it has
been thought somewhat profane to speak in favour of spontaneous vital
production, as if it contradicted holy writ; which says, that God
created animals and vegetables. They do not recollect that God created
all things which exist, and that these have been from the beginning in
a perpetual state of improvement; which appears from the globe itself,
as well as from the animals and vegetables, which possess it. And
lastly, that there is more dignity in our idea of the supreme author
of all things, when we conceive him to be the cause of causes, than
the cause simply of the events, which we see; if there can be any
difference in infinity of power!</p>

<p>Another prejudice which has prevailed against the spontaneous
production of vitality, seems to have arisen from the
misrepresentation of this doctrine, as if the larger animals had been
thus produced; as Ovid supposes after the deluge of Deucalion, that
lions were seen rising out of the mud of the Nile, and struggling to
disentangle their hinder parts. It was not considered, that animals
and vegetables have been perpetually improving by reproduction; and
that spontaneous vitality was only to be looked for in the simplest
organic beings, as in the smallest microscopic animalcules; which
perpetually, perhaps hourly, enlarge themselves by reproduction, like
the roots of tulips from seed, or the buds of seedling trees, which
die annually, leaving others by solitary reproduction rather more
perfect than themselves <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_002" name="page_n_002"></a>(p. 002)</span> for many successive years, till at
length they acquire sexual organs or flowers.</p>

<p>A third prejudice against the existence of spontaneous vital
productions has been the supposed want of analogy; this has also
arisen from the expectation, that the larger or more complicated
animals should be thus produced; which have acquired their present
perfection by successive generations during an uncounted series of
ages. Add to this, that the want of analogy opposes the credibility of
all new discoveries, as of the magnetic needle, and coated electric
jar, and Galvanic pile; which should therefore certainly be well
weighed and nicely investigated before distinct credence is given
them; but then the want of analogy must at length yield to repeated
ocular demonstration.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><i>Preliminary observations.</i></p>

<p>II. Concerning the spontaneous production of the smallest microscopic
animals it should be first observed, that the power of reproduction
distinguishes organic being, whether vegetable or animal, from
inanimate nature. The circulation of fluids in vessels may exist in
hydraulic machines, but the power of reproduction belongs alone to
life. This reproduction of plants and of animals is of two kinds,
which may be termed solitary and sexual. The former of these, as in
the reproduction of the buds of trees, and of the bulbs of tulips, and
of the polypus, and aphis, appears to be the first or most simple mode
of generation, as many of these organic beings afterwards acquire
sexual organs, as the flowers of seedling trees, and of seedling
tulips, and the autumnal progeny of the aphis. See Phytologia.</p>

<p>Secondly, it should be observed, that by reproduction organic beings
are gradually enlarged and improved; which may perhaps more rapidly
and uniformly occur in the simplest modes of animated being; but
occasionally also in the more complicated and perfect kinds. Thus the
buds of a seedling tree, or the bulbs of seedling tulips, become
larger and stronger in the second year than the first, and thus
improve till they acquire flowers or sexes; and the aphis, I <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_003" name="page_n_003"></a>(p. 003)</span>
believe, increases in bulk to the eighth or ninth generation, and then
produces a sexual progeny. Hence the existence of spontaneous vitality
is only to be expected to be found in the simplest modes of animation,
as the complex ones have been formed by many successive reproductions.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><i>Experimental facts.</i></p>

<p>III. By the experiments of Buffon, Reaumur, Ellis, Ingenhouz, and
others, microscopic animals are produced in three or four days,
according to the warmth of the season, in the infusions of all
vegetable or animal matter. One or more of these gentlemen put some
boiling veal broth into a phial previously heated in the fire, and
sealing it up hermetically or with melted wax, observed it to be
replete with animalcules in three or four days.</p>

<p>These microscopic animals are believed to possess a power of
generating others like themselves by solitary reproduction without
sex; and these gradually enlarging and improving for innumerable
successive generations. Mr. Ellis in Phil. Transact. V. LIX. gives
drawings of six kinds of animalcula infusoria, which increase by
dividing across the middle into two distinct animals. Thus in paste
composed of flour and water, which has been suffered to become
acescent, the animalcules called eels, vibrio anguillula, are seen in
great abundance; their motions are rapid and strong; they are
viviparous, and produce at intervals a numerous progeny: animals
similar to these are also found in vinegar; Naturalist's Miscellany by
Shaw and Nodder, Vol. II. These eels were probably at first as minute
as other microscopic animalcules; but by frequent, perhaps hourly
reproduction, have gradually become the large animals above described,
possessing wonderful strength and activity.</p>

<p>To suppose the eggs of the former microscopic animals to float in the
atmosphere, and pass through the sealed glass phial, is so contrary to
apparent nature, as to be totally incredible! and as the latter are
viviparous, it is equally absurd to suppose, that their parents float
universally in the atmosphere to lay their young in paste or vinegar!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_004" name="page_n_004"></a>(p. 004)</span> Not only microscopic animals appear to be produced by a
spontaneous vital process, and then quickly improve by solitary
generation like the buds of trees, or like the polypus and aphis, but
there is one vegetable body, which appears to be produced by a
spontaneous vital process, and is believed to be propagated and
enlarged in so short a time by solitary generation as to become
visible to the naked eye; I mean the green matter first attended to by
Dr. Priestley, and called by him conferva fontinalis. The proofs, that
this material is a vegetable, are from its giving up so much oxygen,
when exposed to the sunshine, as it grows in water, and from its green
colour.</p>

<p>Dr. Ingenhouz asserts, that by filling a bottle with well-water, and
inverting it immediately into a basin of well-water, this green
vegetable is formed in great quantity; and he believes, that the water
itself, or some substance contained in the water, is converted into
this kind of vegetation, which then quickly propagates itself.</p>

<p>M. Girtanner asserts, that this green vegetable matter is not produced
by water and heat alone, but requires the sun's light for this
purpose, as he observed by many experiments, and thinks it arises from
decomposing water deprived of a part of its oxygen, and laughs at Dr.
Priestley for believing that the seeds of this conferva, and the
parents of microscopic animals, exist universally in the atmosphere,
and penetrate the sides of glass jars; Philos. Magazine for May 1800.</p>

<p>Besides this green vegetable matter of Dr. Priestley, there is another
vegetable, the minute beginnings of the growth of which Mr. Ellis
observed by his microscope near the surface of all putrefying
vegetable or animal matter, which is the mucor or mouldiness; the
vegetation of which was amazingly quick so as to be almost seen, and
soon became so large as to be visible to the naked eye. It is
difficult to conceive how the seeds of this mucor can float so
universally in the atmosphere as to fix itself on all putrid matter in
all places.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><i>Theory of Spontaneous Vitality.</i></p>

<p>IV. In animal nutrition the organic matter of the bodies of dead
animals, or vegetables, is taken into the stomach, and there suffers
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_005" name="page_n_005"></a>(p. 005)</span> decompositions and new combinations by a chemical process.
Some parts of it are however absorbed by the lacteals as fast as they
are produced by this process of digestion; in which circumstance this
process differs from common chemical operations.</p>

<p>In vegetable nutrition the organic matter of dead animals, or
vegetables, undergoes chemical decompositions and new combinations on
or beneath the surface of the earth; and parts of it, as they are
produced, are perpetually absorbed by the roots of the plants in
contact with it; in which this also differs from common chemical
processes.</p>

<p>Hence the particles which are produced from dead organic matter by
chemical decompositions or new consequent combinations, are found
proper for the purposes of the nutrition of living vegetable and
animal bodies, whether these decompositions and new combinations are
performed in the stomach or beneath the soil.</p>

<p>For the purposes of nutrition these digested or decomposed recrements
of dead animal or vegetable matter are absorbed by the lacteals of the
stomachs of animals or of the roots of vegetables, and carried into
the circulation of their blood, and these compose new organic parts to
replace others which are destroyed, or to increase the growth of the
plant or animal.</p>

<p>It is probable, that as in inanimate or chemical combinations, one of
the composing materials must possess a power of attraction, and the
other an aptitude to be attracted; so in organic or animated
compositions there must be particles with appetencies to unite, and
other particles with propensities to be united with them.</p>

<p>Thus in the generation of the buds of trees, it is probable that two
kinds of vegetable matter, as they are separated from the solid
system, and float in the circulation, become arrested by two kinds of
vegetable glands, and are then deposed beneath the cuticle of the
tree, and there join together forming a new vegetable, the caudex of
which extends from the plumula at the summit to the radicles beneath
the soil, and constitutes a single fibre of the bark.</p>

<p>These particles appear to be of two kinds; one of them possessing an
appetency to unite with the other, and the latter a propensity to be
united with the former; and they are probably separated from the
vegetable blood by two kinds of glands, one representing those of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_006" name="page_n_006"></a>(p. 006)</span> anthers, and the others those of the stigmas, in the sexual
organs of vegetables; which is spoken of at large in Phytologia, Sect.
VII. and in Zoonomia, Vol. I. Sect. XXXIX. 8. of the third edition, in
octavo; where it is likewise shown, that none of these parts which are
deposited beneath the cuticle of the tree, is in itself a complete
vegetable embryon, but that they form one by their reciprocal
conjunction.</p>

<p>So in the sexual reproduction of animals, certain parts separated from
the living organs, and floating in the blood, are arrested by the
sexual glands of the female, and others by those of the male. Of these
none are complete embryon animals, but form an embryon by their
reciprocal conjunction.</p>

<p>There hence appears to be an analogy between generation and nutrition,
as one is the production of new organization, and the other the
restoration of that which previously existed; and which may therefore
be supposed to require materials somewhat similar. Now the food taken
up by animal lacteals is previously prepared by the chemical process
of digestion in the stomach; but that which is taken up by vegetable
lacteals, is prepared by chemical dissolution of organic matter
beneath the surface of the earth. Thus the particles, which form
generated animal embryons, are prepared from dead organic matter by
the chemico-animal processes of sanguification and of secretion; while
those which form spontaneous microscopic animals or microscopic
vegetables are prepared by chemical dissolutions and new combinations
of organic matter in watery fluids with sufficient warmth.</p>

<p>It may be here added, that the production and properties of some kinds
of inanimate matter, are almost as difficult to comprehend as those of
the simplest degrees of animation. Thus the elastic gum, or
caoutchouc, and some fossile bitumens, when drawn out to a great
length, contract themselves by their elasticity, like an animal fibre
by stimulus. The laws of action of these, and all other elastic
bodies, are not yet understood; as the laws of the attraction of
cohesion, to produce these effects, must be very different from those
of general attraction, since the farther the particles of elastic
bodies are drawn from each other till they separate, the stronger they
seem to attract; and the nearer they are pressed together, the more
they seem to repel; as in bending a spring, or in extending a piece of
elastic gum; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_007" name="page_n_007"></a>(p. 007)</span> which is the reverse to what occurs in the
attractions of disunited bodies; and much wants further investigation.
So the spontaneous production of alcohol or of vinegar, by the vinous
and acetous fermentations, as well as the production of a mucus by
putrefaction which will contract when extended, seems almost as
difficult to understand as the spontaneous production of a fibre from
decomposing animal or vegetable substances, which will contract when
stimulated, and thus constitutes the primordium of life.</p>

<p>Some of the microscopic animals are said to remain dead for many days
or weeks, when the fluid in which they existed is dried up, and
quickly to recover life and motion by the fresh addition of water and
warmth. Thus the chaos redivivum of Linnæus dwells in vinegar and in
bookbinders paste: it revives by water after having been dried for
years, and is both oviparous and viviparous; Syst. Nat. Thus the
vorticella or wheel animal, which is found in rain water that has
stood some days in leaden gutters, or in hollows of lead on the tops
of houses, or in the slime or sediment left by such water, though it
discovers no sign of life except when in the water, yet it is capable
of continuing alive for many months though kept in a dry state. In
this state it is of a globulous shape, exceeds not the bigness of a
grain of sand, and no signs of life appear; but being put into water,
in the space of half an hour a languid motion begins, the globule
turns itself about, lengthens itself by slow degrees, assumes the form
of a lively maggot, and most commonly in a few minutes afterwards puts
out its wheels, swimming vigorously through the water as if in search
of food; or else, fixing itself by the tail, works the wheels in such
a manner as to bring its food to its mouth; English Encyclopedia, Art.
Animalcule.</p>

<p>Thus some shell-snails in the cabinets of the curious have been kept
in a dry state for ten years or longer, and have revived on being
moistened with warmish water; Philos. Transact. So eggs and seeds
after many months torpor, are revived by warmth and moisture; hence it
may be concluded, that even the organic particles of dead animals may,
when exposed to a due degree of warmth and moisture, regain some
degree of vitality, since this is done by more complicate animal
organs in the instances above mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_008" name="page_n_008"></a>(p. 008)</span> The hydra of Linnæus, which dwells in the rivers of Europe
under aquatic plants, has been observed by the curious of the present
time, to revive after it has been dried, to be restored after being
mutilated, to multiply by being divided, to be propagated from small
portions, to live after being inverted; all which would be best
explained by the doctrine of spontaneous reproduction from organic
particles not yet completely decomposed.</p>

<p>To this should be added, that these microscopic animals are found in
all solutions of vegetable or animal matter in water; as black pepper
steeped in water, hay suffered to become putrid in water, and the
water of dunghills, afford animalcules in astonishing numbers. See Mr.
Ellis's curious account of Animalcules produced from an infusion of
Potatoes and Hempseed; Philos. Transact. Vol. LIX. from all which it
would appear, that organic particles of dead vegetables and animals
during their usual chemical changes into putridity or acidity, do not
lose all their organization or vitality, but retain so much of it as
to unite with the parts of living animals in the process of nutrition,
or unite and produce new complicate animals by secretion as in
generation, or produce very simple microscopic animals or microscopic
vegetables, by their new combinations in warmth and moisture.</p>

<p>And finally, that these microscopic organic bodies are multiplied and
enlarged by solitary reproduction without sexual intercourse till they
acquire greater perfection or new properties. Lewenhoek observed in
rain-water which had stood a few days, the smallest scarcely visible
microscopic animalcules, and in a few more days he observed others
eight times as large; English Encyclop. Art. Animalcule.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><i>Conclusion.</i></p>

<p>There is therefore no absurdity in believing that the most simple
animals and vegetables may be produced by the congress of the parts of
decomposing organic matter, without what can properly be termed
generation, as the genus did not previously exist; which accounts for
the endless varieties, as well as for the immense numbers of
microscopic animals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_009" name="page_n_009"></a>(p. 009)</span> The green vegetable matter of Dr. Priestley, which is
universally produced in stagnant water, and the mucor, or mouldiness,
which is seen on the surface of all putrid vegetable and animal
matter, have probably no parents, but a spontaneous origin from the
congress of the decomposing organic particles, and afterwards
propagate themselves. Some other fungi, as those growing in close
wine-vaults, or others which arise from decaying trees, or rotten
timber, may perhaps be owing to a similar spontaneous production, and
not previously exist as perfect organic beings in the juices of the
wood, as some have supposed. In the same manner it would seem, that
the common esculent mushroom is produced from horse dung at any time
and in any place, as is the common practice of many gardeners; Kennedy
on Gardening.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><i>Appendix.</i></p>

<p>The knowledge of microscopic animals is still in its infancy: those
already known are arranged by Mr. Muller into the following classes;
but it is probable, that many more classes, as well as innumerable
individuals, may be discovered by improvements of the microscope, as
Mr. Herschell has discovered so many thousand stars, which were before
invisible, by improvements of the telescope.</p>

<p>Mr. Muller's classes consist of</p>

<ul>
<li>I. <i>Such as have no External Organs.</i></li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>1. Monas: Punctiformis. A mere point.</li>

<li>4. Enchelis: Cylindracea. Cylindrical.</li>
<li>5. Vibrio: Elongatum. Long.</li>

</ol>

<p>1. These animalcules are discovered in two or three days in all
decompositions of organic matter, whether vegetable or animal, in
moderate degrees of warmth with sufficient moisture.</p>

<p>2. They appear to enlarge in a few days, and some to change their
form; which are probably converted from more simple into more
complicate animalcules by repeated reproductions. See Note <a href="#notes8">VIII</a>.</p>

<p>3. In their early state they seem to multiply by viviparous solitary
reproduction, either by external division, as the smaller ones, or by
an internal progeny, as the eels in paste or vinegar; and lastly, in
their more mature state, the larger ones are said to appear to have
sexual connexion. Engl. Encyclop.</p>

<p>4. Those animalcules discovered in pustules of the itch, in the feces
of dysenteric patients, and in semine masculino, I suppose to be
produced by the stagnation and incipient decomposition of those
materials in their receptacles, and not to exist in the living blood
or recent secretions; as none, I believe, have been discovered in
blood when first drawn from the arm, or in fluids newly secreted from
the glands, which have not previously stagnated in their reservoirs.</p>

<p>5. They are observed to move in all directions with ease and rapidity,
and to avoid obstacles, and not to interfere with each other in their
motions. When the water is in part evaporated, they are seen to flock
towards the remaining part, and show great agitation. They sustain a
great degree of cold, as some insects, and perish in much the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_011" name="page_n_011"></a>(p. 011)</span> same degree of heat as destroys insects; all which evince
that they are living animals.</p>

<p>And it is probable, that other or similar animalcules may be produced
in the air, or near the surface of the earth, but it is not so easy to
view them as in water; which as it is transparent, the creatures
produced in it can easily be observed by applying a drop to a
microscope. I hope that microscopic researches may again excite the
attention of philosophers, as unforeseen advantages may probably be
derived from them, like the discovery of a new world.</p>

THE FACULTIES OF THE SENSORIUM.</h4>

<p class="poem20">
  Next the long nerves unite their silver train,<br>
  And young Sensation permeates the brain.<br>
<span class="left50"><span class="smcap">Cant. I.</span> l. 250.</span></p>

<p class="p2">I. The fibres, which constitute the muscles and organs of sense,
possess a power of contraction. The circumstances attending the
exertion of this power of contraction constitute the laws of animal
motion, as the circumstances attending the exertion of the power of
attraction constitute the laws of motion of inanimate matter.</p>

<p>II. The spirit of animation is the immediate cause of the contraction
of animal fibres, it resides in the brain and nerves, and is liable to
general or partial diminution or accumulation.</p>

<p>III. The stimulus of bodies external to the moving organ is the remote
cause of the original contractions of animal fibres.</p>

<p>IV. A certain quantity of stimulus produces irritation, which is an
exertion of the spirit of animation exciting the fibres into
contraction.</p>

<p>V. A certain quantity of contraction of animal fibres, if it be
perceived at all, produces pleasure; a greater or less quantity of
contraction, if it be perceived at all, produces pain; these
constitute sensation.</p>

<p>VI. A certain quantity of sensation produces desire or aversion; these
constitute volition.</p>

<p>VII. All animal motions which have occurred at the same time, or in
immediate succession, become so connected, that when one of them is
reproduced, the other has a tendency to accompany or succeed it. When
fibrous contractions succeed or accompany other fibrous contractions,
the connexion is termed association; when fibrous contractions succeed
sensorial motions, the connexion is termed causation; when fibrous and
sensorial motions reciprocally introduce each other, it is termed
catenation of animal motions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_013" name="page_n_013"></a>(p. 013)</span> VIII. These four faculties of the sensorium during their
inactive state are termed irritability, sensibility, voluntarily, and
associability; in their active state they are termed as above
irritation, sensation, volition, association.</p>

<p>Irritation is an exertion or change of some extreme part of the
sensorium residing in the muscles or organs of sense, in consequence
of the appulses of external bodies.</p>

<p>Sensation is an exertion or change of the central parts of the
sensorium, or of the whole of it, beginning at some of those extreme
parts of it, which reside in the muscles or organs of sense.</p>

<p>Volition is an exertion or change of the central parts of the
sensorium, or of the whole of it, terminating in some of those extreme
parts of it, which reside in the muscles or organs of sense.</p>

<p>Association is an exertion or change of some extreme part of the
sensorium residing in the muscles or organs of sense, in consequence
of some antecedent or attendant fibrous contractions; see Zoonomia,
Vol. I.</p>

<p>The word sensorium is used to express not only the medullary part of
the brain, spinal marrow, nerves, organs of sense and muscles, but
also at the same time that living principle, or spirit of animation,
which resides throughout the body, without being cognizable to our
senses except by its effects.</p>

  Next when imprison'd fires in central caves<br>
  Burst the firm earth, and drank the headlong waves.<br>
<span class="left50"><span class="smcap">Canto I.</span> l. 302.</span></p>

<p class="p2">The great and repeated explosions of volcanoes are shown by Mr.
Mitchell in the Philosoph. Transact. to arise from their communication
with the sea, or with rivers, or inundations; and that after a chink
or crack is made, the water rushing into an immense burning cavern,
and falling on boiling lava, is instantly expanded into steam, and
produces irresistible explosions.</p>

<p>As the first volcanic fires had no previous vent, and were probably
more central, and larger in quantity, before they burst the crust of
the earth then intire, and as the sea covered the whole, it must
rapidly sink down into every opening chink; whence these primeval
earthquakes were of much greater extent, and of much greater force,
than those which occur in the present era.</p>

<p>It should be added, that there may be other elastic vapours produced
by great heat from whatever will evaporate, as mercury, and even
diamonds; which may be more elastic, and consequently exert greater
force than the steam of water even though heated red hot. Which may
thence exert a sufficient power to raise islands and continents, and
even to throw the moon from the earth.</p>

<p>If the moon be supposed to have been thus thrown out of the great
cavity which now contains the South Sea, the immense quantity of water
flowing in from the primeval ocean, which then covered the earth,
would much contribute to leave the continents and islands, which might
be raised at the same time above the surface of the water. In later
days there are accounts of large stones falling from the sky, which
may have been thus thrown by explosion from some distant earthquake,
without sufficient force to cause them to circulate round the earth,
and thus produce numerous small moons or satellites.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_015" name="page_n_015"></a>(p. 015)</span> Mr. Mitchell observes, that the agitations of the earth from
the great earthquake at Lisbon were felt in this country about the
same time after the shock, as sound would have taken in passing from
Lisbon hither; and thence ascribes these agitations to the vibrations
of the solid earth, and not to subterraneous caverns of communication;
Philos. Transact. But from the existence of warm springs at Bath and
Buxton, there must certainly be unceasing subterraneous fires at some
great depth beneath those parts of this island; see on this subject
Botanic Garden, Vol. II. Canto IV. l. 79, note. For an account of the
noxious vapours emitted from volcanoes, see Botanic Garden, Vol. II.

  So from deep lakes the dread musquito springs,<br>

<span class="left50"><span class="smcap">Canto I.</span> l. 327.</span></p>

<p class="p2">The gnat, or musquito, culex pipiens. The larva of this insect lives
chiefly in water, and the pupa moves with great agility. It is fished
for by ducks; and, when it becomes a fly, is the food of the young of
partridges, quails, sparrows, swallows, and other small birds. The
females wound us, and leave a red point; and in India their bite is
more venomous. The male has its antennæ and feelers feathered, and
seldom bites or sucks blood; Lin. Syst. Nat.</p>

<p>It may be driven away by smoke, especially by that from inula
helenium, elecampane; and by that of cannabis, hemp. Kalm. It is said
that a light in a chamber will prevent their attack on sleeping
persons.</p>

<p>The gnats of this country are produced in greater numbers in some
years than others, and are then seen in swarms for many evenings near
the lakes or rivers whence they arise; and, I suppose, emigrate to
upland situations, where fewer of them are produced. About thirty
years ago such a swarm was observed by Mr. Whitehurst for a day or two
about the lofty tower of Derby church, as to give a suspicion of the
fabric being on fire.</p>

<p>Many other kinds of flies have their origin in the water, as perhaps
the whole class of neuroptera. Thus the libellula, dragon fly: the
larva of which hurries amid the water, and is the cruel crocodile of
aquatic insects. After they become flies, they prey principally on the
class of insects termed lepidoptera, and diptera of Linneus. The
ephemera is another of this order, which rises from the lakes in such
quantities in some countries, that the rustics have carried cart-loads
of them to manure their corn lands; the larva swims in the water: in
its fly-state the pleasures of life are of short duration, as its
marriage, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_017" name="page_n_017"></a>(p. 017)</span> production of its progeny, and funeral, are often
celebrated in one day. The phryganea is another fly of this order; the
larva lies concealed under the water in moveable cylindrical tubes of
their own making. In the fly-state they institute evening dances in
the air in swarms, and are fished for by the swallows.</p>

<p>Many other flies, who do not leave their eggs in water, contrive to
lay them in moist places, as the oestros bovis; the larvæ of which
exist in the bodies of cattle, where they are nourished during the
winter, and are occasionally extracted by a bird of the crow-kind
called buphaga. These larvæ are also found in the stomachs of horses,
whom they sometimes destroy; another species of them adhere to the
anus of horses, and creep into the lowest bowel, and are called botts;
and another species enters the frontal sinus of sheep, occasioning a
vertigo called the turn. The musca pendula lives in stagnant water;
the larva is suspended by a thread-form respiratory tube; of the musca
chamæleon, the larva lives in fountains, and the fly occasionally
walks upon the water. The musca vomitoria is produced in carcases;
three of these flies consume the dead body of a horse as soon as a
lion. Lin. Syst. Nat.</p>

AMPHIBIOUS ANIMALS.</h4>

<p class="poem20">
  So still the Diodons, amphibious tribe,<br>
  With twofold lungs the sea and air imbibe.<br>
<span class="left50"><span class="smcap">Cant. I.</span> l. 331.</span></p>

<p class="p2">D. D. Garden dissected the amphibious creature called diodon by
Linneus, and was amazed to find that it possessed both external gills
and internal lungs, which he described and prepared and sent to
Linneus; who thence put this animal into the order nantes of his class
amphibia. He adds also, in his account of polymorpha before the class
amphibia, that some of this class breathe by lungs only, and others by
both lungs and gills.</p>

<p>Some amphibious quadrupeds, as the beaver, water rat, and otter, are
said to have the foramen ovale of the heart open, which communicates
from one cavity of it to the other; and that, during their continuance
under water, the blood can thus for a time circulate without passing
through the lungs; but as it cannot by these means acquire oxygen
either from the air or water, these creatures find it frequently
necessary to rise to the surface to respire. As this foramen ovale is
always open in the f&oelig;tus of quadrupeds, till after its birth that
it begins to respire, it has been proposed by some to keep young
puppies three or four times a day for a minute or two under warm water
to prevent this communication from one cavity of the heart to the
other from growing up; whence it has been thought such dogs might
become amphibious. It is also believed that this circumstance has
existed in some divers for pearl; whose children are said to have been
thus kept under water in their early infancy to enable them afterwards
to succeed in their employment.</p>

<p>But the most frequent distinction of the amphibious animals, that live
much in the water, is, that their heart consists but of one cell; and
as they are pale creatures with but little blood, and that colder
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_019" name="page_n_019"></a>(p. 019)</span> and darker coloured, as frogs and lizards, they require less
oxygen than the warmer animals with a greater quantity and more
scarlet blood; and thence, though they have only lungs, they can stay
long under water without great inconvenience; but are all of them,
like frogs, and crocodiles, and whales, necessitated frequently to
rise above the surface for air.</p>

<p>In this circumstance of their possessing a one-celled heart, and
colder and darker blood, they approach to the state of fish; which
thus appear not to acquire so much oxygen by their gills from the
water as terrestrial animals do by their lungs from the atmosphere;
whence it may be concluded that the gills of fish do not decompose the
water which passes through them, and which contains so much more
oxygen than the air, but that they only procure a small quantity of
oxygen from the air which is diffused in the water; which also is
further confirmed by an experiment with the air-pump, as fish soon die
when put in a glass of water into the exhausted receiver, which they
would not do if their gills had power to decompose the water and
obtain the oxygen from it.</p>

<p>The lamprey, petromyzon, is put by Linneus amongst the nantes, which
are defined to possess both gills and lungs. It has seven spiracula,
or breathing holes, on each side of the neck, and by its more perfect
lungs approaches to the serpent kind; Syst. Nat. The means by which it
adheres to stones, even in rapid streams, is probably owing to a
partial vacuum made by its respiring organs like sucking, and may be
compared to the ingenious method by which boys are seen to lift large
stones in the street, by applying to them a piece of strong moist
leather with a string through the centre of it; which, when it is
forcibly drawn upwards, produces a partial vacuum under it, and thus
the stone is supported by the pressure of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The leech, hirudo, and the remora, echeneis, adhere strongly to
objects probably by a similar method. I once saw ten or twelve leeches
adhere to each foot of an old horse a little above his hoofs, who was
grazing in a morass, and which did not lose their hold when he moved
about. The bare-legged travellers in Ceylon are said to be much
infested by leeches; and the sea-leech, hirudo muricata, is said
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_020" name="page_n_020"></a>(p. 020)</span> to adhere to fish, and the remora is said to adhere to ships
in such numbers as to retard their progress.</p>

<p>The respiratory organ of the whale, I suppose, is pulmonary in part,
as he is obliged to come frequently to the surface, whence he can be
pursued after he is struck with the harpoon; and may nevertheless be
in part like the gills of other fish, as he seems to draw in water
when he is below the surface, and emits it again when he rises above
it.</p>

HIEROGLYPHIC CHARACTERS.</h4>

<p class="poem20">
  So erst as Egypt's rude designs explain.<br>
<span class="left50"><span class="smcap">Canto I.</span> l. 351.</span></p>

<p class="p2">The outlines of animal bodies, which gave names to the constellations,
as well as the characters used in chemistry for the metals, and in
astronomy for the planets, were originally hieroglyphic figures, used
by the magi of Egypt before the invention of letters, to record their
discoveries in those sciences.</p>

<p>Other hieroglyphic figures seem to have been designed to perpetuate
the events of history, the discoveries in other arts, and the opinions
of those ancient philosophers on other subjects. Thus their figures of
Venus for beauty, Minerva for wisdom, Mars and Bellona for war,
Hercules for strength, and many others, became afterwards the deities
of Greece and Rome; and together with the figures of Time, Death, and
Fame, constitute the language of the painters to this day.</p>

<p>From the similarity of the characters which designate the metals in
chemistry, and the planets in astronomy, it may be concluded that
these parts of science were then believed to be connected; whence
astrology seems to have been a very early superstition. These, so far,
constitute an universal visible language in those sciences.</p>

<p>So the glory, or halo, round the head is a part of the universal
language of the eye, designating a holy person; wings on the shoulders
denote a good angel; and a tail and hoof denote the figure of an evil
demon; to which may be added the cap of liberty and the tiara of
popedom. It is to be wished that many other universal characters could
be introduced into practice, which might either constitute a more
comprehensive language for painters, or for other arts; as those of
ciphers and signs have done for arithmetic and algebra, and crotchets
for music, and the alphabets for articulate sounds; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_022" name="page_n_022"></a>(p. 022)</span> so a
zigzag line made on white paper by a black-lead pencil, which
communicates with the surface of the mercury in the barometer, as the
paper itself is made constantly to move laterally by a clock, and
daily to descend through the space necessary, has ingeniously produced
a most accurate visible account of the rise and fall of the mercury in
the barometer every hour in the year.</p>

<p>Mr. Grey's Memoria Technica was designed as an artificial language to
remember numbers, as of the eras, or dates of history. This was done
by substituting one consonant and one vowel for each figure of the ten
cyphers used in arithmetic, and by composing words of these letters;
which words Mr. Grey makes into hexameter verses, and produces an
audible jargon, which is to be committed to memory, and occasionally
analysed into numbers when required. An ingenious French botanist,
Monsieur Bergeret, has proposed to apply this idea of Mr. Grey to a
botanical nomenclature, by making the name of each plant to consist of
letters, which, when analysed, were to signify the number of the
class, order, genus, and species, with a description also of some
particular part of the plant, which was designed to be both an audible
and visible language.</p>

<p>Bishop Wilkins in his elaborate "Essay towards a Real Character and a
Philosophical Language," has endeavoured to produce, with the greatest
simplicity, and accuracy, and conciseness, an universal language both
to be written and spoken, for the purpose of the communication of all
our ideas with greater exactness and less labour than is done in
common languages, as they are now spoken and written. But we have to
lament that the progress of general science is yet too limited both
for his purpose, and for that even of a nomenclature for botany; and
that the science of grammar, and even the number and manner of the
pronunciation of the letters of the alphabet, are not yet determined
with such accuracy as would be necessary to constitute Bishop
Wilkins's grand design of an universal language, which might
facilitate the acquirement of knowledge, and thus add to the power and
happiness of mankind.</p>

<p>The immediate cause of the infirmities of age, or of the progress of
life to death, has not yet been well ascertained. The answer to the
question, why animals become feeble and diseased after a time, though
nourished with the same food which increased their growth from
infancy, and afterwards supported them for many years in unimpaired
health and strength, must be sought for from the laws of animal
excitability, which, though at first increased, is afterwards
diminished by frequent repetitions of its adapted stimulus, and at
length ceases to obey it.</p>

<p>1. There are four kinds of stimulus which induce the fibres to
contract, which constitute the muscles or the organs of sense; as,
first, The application of external bodies, which excites into action
the sensorial power of irritation; 2dly, Pleasure and pain, which
excite into action the sensorial power of sensation; 3dly, Desire and
aversion, which excite into action the power of volition; and lastly,
The fibrous contractions, which precede association, which is another
sensorial power; see Zoonomia, Vol. I. Sect. II. 13.</p>

<p>Many of the motions of the organic system, which are necessary to
life, are excited by more than one of these stimuli at the same time,
and some of them occasionally by them all. Thus respiration is
generally caused by the stimulus of blood in the lungs, or by the
sensation of the want of oxygen; but is also occasionally voluntary.
The actions of the heart also, though generally owing to the stimulus
of the blood, are also inflamed by the association of its motions with
those of the stomach, whence sometimes arises an inequality of the
pulse, and with other parts of the system, as with the capillaries,
whence heat of the skin in fevers with a feeble pulse, see Zoonomia.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_024" name="page_n_024"></a>(p. 024)</span> They are also occasionally influenced by sensation, as is
seen in the paleness occasioned by fear, or the blush of shame and
anger; and lastly the motions of the heart are sometimes assisted by
volition; thus in those who are much weakened by fevers, the pulse is
liable to stop during their sleep, and to induce great distress; which
is owing at that time to the total suspension of voluntary power; the
same occurs during sleep in some asthmatic patients.</p>

<p>2. The debility of approaching age appears to be induced by the
inactivity of many parts of the system, or their disobedience to their
usual kinds and quantities of stimulus: thus the pallid appearance of
the skin of old age is owing to the inactivity of the heart, which
ceases to obey the irritation caused by the stimulus of the blood, or
its association with other moving organs with its former energy;
whence the capillary arteries are not sufficiently distended in their
diastole, and consequently contract by their elasticity, so as to
close the canal, and their sides gradually coalesce. Of these, those
which are most distant from the heart, and of the smallest diameters,
will soonest close, and become impervious; hence the hard pulse of
aged patients is occasioned by the coalescence of the sides of the
vasa vasorum, or capillary arteries of the coats of the other
arteries.</p>

<p>The veins of elderly people become turgid or distended with blood, and
stand prominent on the skin; for as these do not possess the
elasticity of the arteries, they become distended with accumulation of
blood; when the heart by its lessened excitability does not contract
sufficiently forcibly, or frequently, to receive, as fast as usual,
the returning blood; and their apparent prominence on the skin is
occasioned by the deficient secretion of fat or mucus in the cellular
membrane; and also to the contraction and coalescence and consequent
less bulk of many capillary arteries.</p>

<p>3. Not only the muscular fibres lose their degree of excitability from
age, as in the above examples; and as may be observed in the tremulous
hands and feeble step of elderly persons; but the organs of sense
become less excitable by the stimulus of external objects; whence the
sight and hearing become defective; the stimulus of the sensorial
power of sensation also less affects the aged, who grieve less for the
loss of friends or for other disappointments; it should nevertheless
be observed, that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_025" name="page_n_025"></a>(p. 025)</span> when the sensorial power of irritation is
much exhausted, or its production much diminished; the sensorial power
of sensation appears for a time to be increased; as in intoxication
there exists a kind of delirium and quick flow of ideas, and yet the
person becomes so weak as to totter as he walks; but this delirium is
owing to the defect of voluntary power to correct the streams of ideas
by intuitive analogy, as in dreams: see Zoonomia: and thus also those
who are enfeebled by habits of much vinous potation, or even by age
alone, are liable to weep at shaking hands with a friend, whom they
have not lately seen; which is owing to defect of voluntary power to
correct their trains of ideas caused by sensation, and not to the
increased quantity of sensation, as I formerly supposed.</p>

<p>The same want of voluntary power to keep the trains of sensitive ideas
consistent, and to compare them by intuitive analogy with the order of
nature, is the occasion of the starting at the clapping to of a door,
or the fall of a key, which occasions violent surprise with fear and
sometimes convulsions, in very feeble hysterical patients, and is not
owing I believe (as I formerly supposed) to increased sensation; as
they are less sensible to small stimuli than when in health.</p>

<p>Old people are less able also to perform the voluntary exertions of
exercise or of reasoning, and lastly the association of their ideas
becomes more imperfect, as they are forgetful of the names of persons
and places; the associations of which are less permanent, than those
of the other words of a language, which are more frequently repeated.</p>

<p>4. This disobedience of the fibres of age to their usual stimuli, has
generally been ascribed to repetition or habit, as those who live near
a large clock, or a mill, or a waterfall, soon cease to attend to the
perpetual noise of it in the day, and sleep dining the night
undisturbed. Thus all medicines, if repeated too frequently, gradually
lose their effect; as wine and opium cease to intoxicate: some
disagreeable tastes as tobacco, by frequent repetition cease to be
disagreeable; grief and pain gradually diminish and at length cease
altogether; and hence life itself becomes tolerable.</p>

<p>This diminished power of contraction of the fibres of the muscles or
organs of sense, which constitutes permanent debility or old age, may
arise from a deficient secretion of sensorial power in the brain, as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_026" name="page_n_026"></a>(p. 026)</span> well as from the disobedience of the muscles and organs of
sense to their usual stimuli; but this less production of sensorial
power must depend on the inactivity of the glands, which compose the
brain, and are believed to separate it perpetually from the blood; and
is thence owing to a similar cause with the inaction of the fibres of
the other parts of the system.</p>

<p>It is finally easy to understand how the fibres may cease to act by
the usual quantity of stimulus after having been previously exposed to
a greater quantity of stimulus, or to one too long continued; because
the expenditure of sensorial power has then been greater than its
production; but it is not easy to explain why the repetition of
fibrous contractions, which during the meridian of life did not expend
the sensorial power faster than it was produced; or only in such a
degree as was daily restored by rest and sleep, should at length in
the advance of life expend too much of it; or otherwise, that less of
it should be produced in the brain; or reside in the nerves; lastly
that the fibres should become less excitable by the usual quantity of
it.</p>

<p>5. But these facts would seem to show, that all parts of the system
are not changed as we advance in life, as some have supposed; as in
that case it might have preserved for ever its excitability; and it
might then perhaps have been easier for nature to have continued her
animals and vegetables for ever in their mature state, than
perpetually by a complicate apparatus to have produced new ones, and
suffer the old ones to perish; for a further account of stimulus and
the consequent animal exertion, see Zoonomia, Vol. I. Sect. 12.</p>


<p class="center p2">II. <i>Means of preventing old age.</i></p>

<p>The means of preventing the approach of age must therefore consist in
preventing the inexcitability of the fibres, or the diminution of the
production of sensorial power.</p>

<p>1. As animal motion cannot be performed without the fluid matter of
heat, in which all things are immersed, and without a sufficient
quantity of moisture to prevent rigidity: nothing seems so well
adapted to both these purposes as the use of the warm bath; and
especially in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_027" name="page_n_027"></a>(p. 027)</span> those, who become thin or emaciated with age,
and who have a hard and dry skin, with hardness of the coat of the
arteries; which feels under the finger like a cord; the patient should
sit in warm water for half an hour every day, or alternate days, or
twice a week; the heat should be about ninety-eight degrees on
Fahrenheit's scale, or of such a warmth, as may be most agreeable to
his sensation; but on leaving the bath he should always be kept so
cool, whether he goes into bed, or continues up, as not sensibly to
perspire.</p>

<p>There is a popular prejudice, that the warm bath relaxes people, and
that the cold bath braces them; which are mechanical terms belonging
to drums and fiddle-strings, but not applicable except metaphorically
to animal bodies, and then commonly mean weakness and strength: during
the continuance in the bath the patient does not lose weight, unless
he goes in after a full meal, but generally weighs heavier as the
absorption is greater than the perspiration; but if he suffers himself
to sweat on his leaving the bath, he will undoubtedly be weakened by
the increased action of the system, and its exhaustion: the same
occurs to those who are heated by exercise, or by wine, or spice, but
not during their continuance in the warm bath: whence we may conclude,
that the warm bath is the most harmless of all those stimuli, which
are greater than our natural habits have accustomed us to; and that it
particularly counteracts the approach of old age in emaciated people
with dry skins.</p>

<p>It may be here observed in favour of bathing, that some fish are
believed to continue to a great age, and continually to enlarge in
size, as they advance in life; and that long after their state of
puberty. I have seen perch full of spawn, which were less than two
inches long; and it is known, that they will grow to six or eight
times that size; it is said, that the whales, which have been caught
of late years, are much less in size than those, which were caught,
when first the whale-fishery was established; as the large ones, which
were supposed to have been some hundred years old, are believed to be
already destroyed.</p>

<p>All cold-blooded amphibious animals more slowly waste their sensorial
power; as they are accustomed to less stimulus from their respiring
less oxygen; and their movements in water are slower than those of
aerial animals from the greater resistance of the element. There
besides <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_028" name="page_n_028"></a>(p. 028)</span> seems to be no obstacle to the growth of aquatic
animals; as by means of the air-bladder, they can make their specific
gravity the same as that of the water in which they swim. And the
moisture of the element seems well adapted to counteract the rigidity
of their fibres; and as their exertions in locomotion, and the
pressure of some parts on others, are so much less than in the bodies
of land animals.</p>

<p>2. But as all excessive stimuli exhaust the sensorial power, and
render the system less excitable for a time till the quantity of
sensorial power is restored by sleep, or by the diminution or absence
of stimulus; which is seen by the weakness of inebriates for a day at
least after intoxication. And as the frequent repetition of this great
and unnatural stimulus of fermented liquors produces a permanent
debility, or disobedience of the system to the usual and natural kinds
and quantities of stimulus, as occurs in those who have long been
addicted to the ingurgitation of fermented liquors.</p>

<p>And as, secondly, the too great deficiency of the quantity of natural
stimuli, as of food, and warmth, or of fresh air, produces also
diseases; as is often seen in the children of the poor in large towns,
who become scrofulous from want of due nourishment, and from cold,
damp, unairy lodgings.</p>

<p>The great and principal means to prevent the approach of old age and
death, must consist in the due management of the quantity of every
kind of stimulus, but particularly of that from objects external to
the moving organ; which may excite into action too great or too small
a quantity of the sensorial power of irritation, which principally
actuates the vital organs. Whence the use of much wine, or opium, or
spice, or of much salt, by their unnatural stimulus induces consequent
debility, and shortens life, on the one hand, by the exhaustion of
sensorial power; so on the other hand, the want of heat, food, and
fresh air, induces debility from defect of stimulus, and a consequent
accumulation of sensorial power, and a general debility of the system.
Whence arise the pains of cold and hunger, and those which are called
nervous; and which are the cause of hysteric, epileptic, and perhaps
of asthmatic paroxysms, and of the cold fits of fever.</p>

<p>3. Though all excesses of increase and decrease of stimulus should be
avoided, yet a certain variation of stimulus seems to prolong the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_029" name="page_n_029"></a>(p. 029)</span> excitability of the system; as during any diminution of the
usual quantity of stimulus, an accumulation of sensorial power is
produced; and in consequence the excitability, which was lessened by
the action of habitual stimulus, becomes restored. Thus those, who are
uniformly habituated to much artificial heat, as in warm parlours in
the winter months, lose their irritability in some degree, and become
feeble like hot-house plants; but by frequently going for a time into
the cold air, the sensorial power of irritability is accumulated and
they become stronger.</p>

<p>Whence it may be deduced, that the variations of the cold and heat of
this climate contribute to strengthen its inhabitants, who are more
active and vigorous, and live longer, than those of either much warmer
or much colder latitudes.</p>

<p>This accumulation of sensorial power from diminution of stimulus any
one may observe, who in severe weather may sit by the fire-side till
he is chill and uneasy with the sensation of cold; but if he walks
into the frosty air for a few minutes, an accumulation of sensorial
power is produced by diminution of the stimulus of heat, and on his
returning into the room where he was chill before, his whole skin will
now glow with warmth.</p>

<p>Hence it may be concluded, that the variations of the quantity of
stimuli within certain limits contribute to our health; and that those
houses which are kept too uniformly warm, are less wholesome than
where the inhabitants are occasionally exposed to cold air in passing
from one room to another.</p>

<p>Nevertheless to those weak habits with pale skins and large pupils of
the eyes, whose degree of irritability is less than health requires,
as in scrofulous, hysterical, and some consumptive constitutions, a
climate warmer than our own may be of service, as a greater stimulus
of heat may be wanted to excite their less irritability. And also a
more uniform quantity of heat may be serviceable to consumptive
patients than is met with in this country, as the lungs cannot be
clothed like the external skin, and are therefore subject to greater
extremes of heat and cold in passing in winter from a warm room into
the frosty air.</p>

<p>4. It should nevertheless be observed, that there is one kind of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_030" name="page_n_030"></a>(p. 030)</span> stimulus, which though it be employed in quantity beyond its
usual state, seems to increase the production of sensorial power
beyond the expenditure of it (unless its excess is great indeed) and
thence to give permanent strength and energy to the system; I mean
that of volition. This appears not only from the temporary strength of
angry or insane people, but because insanity even cures some diseases
of debility, as I have seen in dropsy, and in some fevers; but it is
also observable, that many who have exerted much voluntary effort
during their whole lives, have continued active to great age. This
however may be conceived to arise from these great exertions being
performed principally by the organs of sense, that is by exciting and
comparing ideas; as in those who have invented sciences, or have
governed nations, and which did not therefore exhaust the sensorial
power of those organs which are necessary to life, but perhaps rather
prevented them from being sooner impaired, their sensorial power not
having been so frequently exhausted by great activity, for very
violent exercise of the body, long continued, forwards old age; as is
seen in post-horses that are cruelly treated, and in many of the poor,
who with difficulty support their families by incessant labour.</p>

<a id="notes7_3" name="notes7_3"></a>
<p class="center p2">III. <i>Theory of the Approach of Age.</i></p>

<p>The critical reader is perhaps by this time become so far interested
in this subject as to excuse a more prolix elucidation of it.</p>

<p>In early life the repetition of animal actions occasions them to be
performed with greater facility, whether those repetitions are
produced by volition, sensation, or irritation; because they soon
become associated together, if as much sensorial power is produced
between every reiteration of action, as is expended by it.</p>

<p>But if a stimulus be repeated at uniform intervals of time, the
action, whether of our muscles or organs of sense, is performed with
still greater facility and energy; because the sensorial power of
association mentioned above, is combined with the sensorial power of
irritation, and forms part of the diurnal chain of animal motions;
that <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_031" name="page_n_031"></a>(p. 031)</span> is, in common language, the acquired habit assists the
power of the stimulus; see Zoonomia, Vol. I. Sect. XXII. 2. and Sect.
XII. 3. 3.</p>

<p>On this circumstance depends the easy motions of the fingers in
performing music, and of the feet and arms in dancing and fencing, and
of the hands in the use of tools in mechanic arts, as well as all the
vital motions which animate and nourish organic bodies.</p>

<p>On the contrary, many animal motions by perpetual repetition are
performed with less energy; as those who live near a waterfall, or a
smith's forge, after a time, cease to hear them. And in those
infectious diseases which are attended with fever, as the small-pox
and measles, violent motions of the system are excited, which at
length cease, and cannot again be produced by application of the same
stimulating material; as when those are inoculated for the small-pox,
who have before undergone that malady. Hence the repetition, which
occasions animal actions for a time to be performed with greater
energy, occasions them at length to become feeble, or to cease
entirely.</p>

<p>To explain this difficult problem we must more minutely consider the
catenations of animal motions, as described in Zoonomia, Vol. I. Sect.
XVII. The vital motions, as suppose of the heart and arterial system,
commence from the irritation occasioned by the stimulus of the blood,
and then have this irritation assisted by the power of association; at
the same time an agreeable sensation is produced by the due actions of
the fibres, as in the secretions of the glands, which constitutes the
pleasure of existence; this agreeable sensation is intermixed between
every link of this diurnal chain of actions, and contributes to
produce it by what is termed animal causation. But there is also a
degree of the power of volition excited in consequence of this vital
pleasure, which is also intermixed between the links of the chain of
fibrous actions; and thus also contributes to its uniform easy and
perpetual production.</p>

<p>The effects of surprise and novelty must now be considered by the
patient reader, as they affect the catenations of action; and, I hope,
the curiosity of the subject will excuse the prolixity of this account
of it. When any violent stimulus breaks the passing current or
catenation of our ideas, surprise is produced, which is accompanied
with <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_032" name="page_n_032"></a>(p. 032)</span> pain or pleasure, and consequent volition to examine
the object of it, as explained in Zoonomia, Vol. I. Sect. XVIII. 17,
and which never affects us in sleep. In our waking hours whenever an
idea of imagination occurs, which is incongruous to our former
experience, we feel another kind of surprise, and instantly dissever
the train of imagination by the power of volition, and compare the
incongruous idea with our previous knowledge of nature, and reject it
by an act of reasoning, of which we are unconscious, termed in
Zoonomia, "Intuitive Analogy," Vol. I Sect. XVII. 7.</p>

<p>The novelty of any idea may be considered as affecting us with another
kind of surprise, or incongruity, as it differs from the usual train
of our ideas, and forms a new link in this perpetual chain; which, as
it thus differs from the ordinary course of nature, we instantly
examine by the voluntary efforts of intuitive analogy; or by
reasoning, which we attend to; and compare it with the usual
appearances of nature.</p>

<p>These ideas which affect us with surprise, or incongruity, or novelty,
are attended with painful or pleasurable sensation; which we mentioned
before as intermixing with all catenations of animal actions, and
contributing to strengthen their perpetual and energetic production;
and also exciting in some degree the power of volition, which also
intermixes with the links of the chain of animal actions, and
contributes to produce it.</p>

<p>Now by frequent repetition the surprise, incongruity, or novelty
ceases; and, in consequence, the pleasure or pain which accompanied
it, and also the degree of volition which was excited by that
sensation of pain or pleasure; and thus the sensorial power of
sensation and of volition are subducted from the catenation of vital
actions, and they are in consequence produced much weaker, and at
length cease entirely. Whence we learn why contagious matters induce
their effects on the circulation but once; and why, in process of
time, the vital movements are performed with less energy, and at
length cease; whence the debilities of age, and consequent death.</p>

REPRODUCTION.</h4>

<p class="poem20">
  But Reproduction with ethereal fires<br>
  New life rekindles, ere the first expires.<br>
<span class="left50"><span class="smcap">Canto II.</span> l. 13.</span></p>

<p class="p2">I. The reproduction or generation of living organized bodies, is the
great criterion or characteristic which distinguishes animation from
mechanism. Fluids may circulate in hydraulic machines, or simply move
in them, as mercury in the barometer or thermometer, but the power of
producing an embryon which shall gradually acquire similitude to its
parent, distinguishes artificial from natural organization.</p>

<p>The reproduction of plants and animals appears to be of two kinds,
solitary and sexual; the former occurs in the formation of the buds of
trees, and the bulbs of tulips; which for several successions generate
other buds, and other bulbs, nearly similar to the parent, but
constantly approaching to greater perfection, so as finally to produce
sexual organs, or flowers, and consequent seeds.</p>

<p>The same occurs in some inferior kinds of animals; as the aphises in
the spring and summer are viviparous for eight or nine generations,
which successively produce living descendants without sexual
intercourse, and are themselves, I suppose, without sex; at length in
the autumn they propagate males and females, which copulate and lay
eggs, which lie dormant during the winter, and are hatched by the
vernal sun; while the truffle, and perhaps mushrooms amongst
vegetables, and the polypus and tænia amongst insects, perpetually
propagate themselves by solitary reproduction, and have not yet
acquired male and female organs.</p>

<p>Philosophers have thought these viviparous aphides, and the tænia, and
volvox, to be females; and have supposed them to have been impregnated
long before their nativity within each other; so the tænia and volvox
still continue to produce their offspring without sexual <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_034" name="page_n_034"></a>(p. 034)</span>
intercourse. One extremity of the tænia, is said by Linneus to grow
old, whilst at the other end new ones are generated proceeding to
infinity like the roots of grass. The volvox globator is transparent,
and carries within itself children and grandchildren to the fifth
generation like the aphides; so that the tænia produces children and
grandchildren longitudinally in a chain-like series, and the volvox
propagates an offspring included within itself to the fifth
generation; Syst. Nat.</p>

<p>Many microscopic animals, and some larger ones, as the hydra or
polypus, are propagated by splitting or dividing; and some still
larger animals, as oysters, and perhaps eels, have not yet acquired
sexual organs, but produce a paternal progeny, which requires no
mother to supply it with a nidus, or with nutriment and oxygenation;
and, therefore, very accurately resemble the production of the buds of
trees, and the wires of some herbaceous plants, as of knot-grass and
of strawberries, and the bulbs of other plants, as of onions and
potatoes; which is further treated of in Phytologia, Sect. VII.</p>

<p>The manner in which I suspect the solitary reproduction of the buds of
trees to be effected, may also be applied to the solitary generation
of the insects mentioned above, and probably of many others, perhaps
of all the microscopic ones. It should be previously observed, that
many insects are hermaphrodite, possessing both male and female organs
of reproduction, as shell-snails and dew-worms; but that these are
seen reciprocally to copulate with each other, and are believed not to
be able to impregnate themselves; which belongs, therefore, to sexual
generation, and not to the solitary reproduction of which I am now
speaking.</p>

<p>As in the chemical production of any new combination of matter, two
kinds of particles appear to be necessary; one of which must possess
the power of attraction, and the other the aptitude to be attracted,
as a magnet and a piece of iron; so in vegetable or animal
combinations, whether for the purpose of nutrition or for
reproduction, there must exist also two kinds of organic matter; one
possessing the appetency to unite, and the other the propensity to be
united; (see Zoonomia, octavo edition, Sect. XXXIX. 8.) Hence in the
generation of the buds of trees, there are probably two kinds of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_035" name="page_n_035"></a>(p. 035)</span> glands, which acquire from the vegetable blood, and deposite
beneath the cuticle of the tree two kinds of formative organic matter,
which unite and form parts of the new vegetable embryon; which again
uniting with other such organizations form the caudex, or the plumula,
or the radicle, of a new vegetable bud.</p>

<p>A similar mode of reproduction by the secretion of two kinds of
organic particles from the blood, and by depositing them either
internally as in the vernal and summer aphis or volvox, or externally
as in the polypus and tænia, probably obtains in those animals; which
are thence propagated by the father only, not requiring a cradle, or
nutriment, or oxygenation from a mother; and that the five
generations, said to be seen in the transparent volvox globator within
each other, are perhaps the successive progeny to be delivered at
different periods of time from the father, and erroneously supposed to
be mothers impregnated before their nativity.</p>

<p class="p2">II. Sexual as well as solitary reproduction appears to be effected by
two kinds of glands; one of which collects or secretes from the blood
formative organic particles with appetencies to unite, and the other
formative organic particles with propensities to be united. These
probably undergo some change by a kind of digestion in their
respective glands; but could not otherwise unite previously in the
mass of blood from its perpetual motion.</p>

<p>The first mode of sexual reproduction seems to have been by the
formation of males into hermaphrodites; that is, when the numerous
formative glands, which existed in the caudex of the bud of a tree, or
on the surface of a polypus, became so united as to form but two
glands; which might then be called male and female organs. But they
still collect and secrete their adapted particles from the same mass
of blood as in snails and dew-worms, but do not seem to be so placed
as to produce an embryon by the mixture of their secreted fluids, but
to require the mutual assistance of two hermaphrodites for that
purpose.</p>

<p>From this view-of the subject, it would appear that vegetables and
animals were at first propagated by solitary generation, and
afterwards by hermaphrodite sexual generation; because most vegetables
possess at this day both male and female organs in the same flower,
which <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_036" name="page_n_036"></a>(p. 036)</span> Linneus has thence well called hermaphrodite flowers;
and that this hermaphrodite mode of reproduction still exists in many
insects, as in snails and worms; and, finally, because all the male
quadrupeds, as well as men, possess at this day some remains of the
female apparatus, as the breasts with nipples, which still at their
nativity are said to be replete with a kind of milk, and the nipples
swell on titillation.</p>

<p>Afterwards the sexes seem to have been formed in vegetables as in
flowers, in addition to the power of solitary reproduction by buds. So
in animals the aphis is propagated both by solitary reproduction as in
spring, or by sexual generation as in autumn; then the vegetable sexes
began to exist in separate plants, as in the classes mon&oelig;cia and
di&oelig;cia, or both of them in the same plant also, as in the class
polygamia; but the larger and more perfect animals are now propagated
by sexual reproduction only, which seems to have been the
chef-d'&oelig;uvre, or capital work of nature; as appears by the
wonderful transformations of leaf-eating caterpillars into
honey-eating moths and butterflies, apparently for the sole purpose of
the formation of sexual organs, as in the silk-worm, which takes no
food after its transformation, but propagates its species and dies.</p>


<p class="p2 center">III. <i>Recapitulation.</i></p>

<p>The microscopic productions of spontaneous vitality, and the next most
inferior kinds of vegetables and animals, propagate by solitary
generation only; as the buds and bulbs raised immediately from seeds,
the lycoperdon tuber, with probably many other fungi, and the polypus,
volvox, and tænia. Those of the next order propagate both by solitary
and sexual reproduction, as those buds and bulbs which produce flowers
as well as other buds or bulbs; and the aphis, and probably many other
insects. Whence it appears, that many of those vegetables and animals,
which are produced by solitary generation, gradually become more
perfect, and at length produce a sexual progeny.</p>

<p>A third order of organic nature consists of hermaphrodite vegetables
and animals, as in those flowers which have anthers and stigmas in the
same corol; and in many insects, as leeches, snails, and worms;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_037" name="page_n_037"></a>(p. 037)</span> and perhaps all those reptiles which have no bones,
according to the observation of M. Poupart, who thinks, that the
number of hermaphrodite animals exceeds that of those which are
divided into sexes; Mém. de l'Acad. des Sciences. These hermaphrodite
insects I suspect <i>to</i> be incapable of impregnating themselves for
reasons mentioned in Zoonomia, Sect. XXXIX. 6. 2.</p>

<p>And, lastly, the most perfect orders of animals are propagated by
sexual intercourse only; which, however, does not extend to
vegetables, as all those raised from seed produce some generations of
buds or bulbs, previous to their producing flowers, as occurs not only
in trees, but also in the annual plants. Thus three or four joints of
wheat grow upon each other, before that which produces a flower; which
joints are all separate plants growing over each other, like the buds
of trees, previous to the uppermost; though this happens in a few
months in annual plants, which requires as many years in the
successive buds of trees; as is further explained in Phytologia, Sect.
IX. 3. 1.</p>


<p class="p2 center">IV. <i>Conclusion.</i></p>

<p>Where climate is favourable, and salubrious food plentiful, there is
reason to believe, that the races of animals perpetually improve by
reproduction. The smallest microscopic animals become larger ones in a
short time, probably by successive reproductions, as is so distinctly
seen in the buds of seedling apple-trees, and in the bulbs of tulips
raised from seed; both which die annually, and leave behind them one
or many, which are more perfect than themselves, till they produce a
sexual progeny, or flowers. To which may be added, the rapid
improvement of our domesticated dogs, horses, rabbits, pigeons, which
improve in size, or in swiftness, or in the sagacity of the sense of
smell, or in colour, or other properties, by sexual reproduction.</p>

<p>The great Linneus having perceived the changes produced in the
vegetable world by sexual reproduction, has supposed that not more
than about sixty plants were at first created, and that all the others
have been formed by their solitary or sexual reproductions; and adds,
Suadent hæc Creatoris leges a simplicibus ad composita; Gen. Plant.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_038" name="page_n_038"></a>(p. 038)</span> preface to the natural orders, and Amenit. Acad. VI. 279.
This mode of reasoning may be extended to the most simple productions
of spontaneous vitality.</p>

<p>There is one curious circumstance of animal life analogous in some
degree to this wonderful power of reproduction; which is seen in the
propagation of some contagious diseases. Thus one grain of variolous
matter, inserted by inoculation, shall in about seven days stimulate
the system into unnatural action; which in about seven days more
produces ten thousand times the quantity of a similar material thrown
out on the skin in pustules!</p>

<p>The mystery of reproduction, which alone distinguishes organic life
from mechanic or chemic action, is yet wrapt in darkness. During the
decomposition of organic bodies, where there exists a due degree of
warmth with moisture, new microscopic animals of the most minute kind
are produced; and these possess the wonderful power of reproduction,
or of producing animals similar to themselves in their general
structure, but with frequent additional improvements; which the
preceding parent might in some measure have acquired by his habits of
life or accidental situation.</p>

<p>But it may appear too bold in the present state of our knowledge on
this subject, to suppose that all vegetables and animals now existing
were originally derived from the smallest microscopic ones, formed by
spontaneous vitality? and that they have by innumerable reproductions,
during innumerable centuries of time, gradually acquired the size,
strength, and excellence of form and faculties, which they now
possess? and that such amazing powers were originally impressed on
matter and spirit by the great Parent of Parents! Cause of Causes! Ens
Entium!</p>

STORGE.</h4>

<p class="poem20">
  And Heaven-born <span class="smcap">Storge</span> weaves the social chain.<br>
<span class="left50"><span class="smcap">Canto II.</span> l. 92.</span></p>

<p class="p2">The Greek word Storge is used for the affection of parents to
children; which was also visibly represented by the Stork or Pelican
feeding her young with blood taken from her own wounded bosom. A
number of Pelicans form a semicircle in shallow parts of the sea near
the coast, standing on their long legs; and thus including a shoal of
small fish, they gradually approach the shore; and seizing the fish as
they advance, receive them into a pouch under their throats; and
bringing them to land regurgitate them for the use of their young, or
for their future support. Adanson, Voyage to Senegal. In this country
the parent Pigeons both male and female swallow the grain or other
seeds, which they collect for their young, and bring it up mixed with
a kind of milk from their stomachs, with their bills inserted into the
mouths of the young doves. J. Hunter's works.</p>

<p>The affection of the parent to the young in experienced mothers may be
in part owing to their having been relieved by them from the burden of
their milk; but it is difficult to understand, how this affection
commences in those mothers of the bestial world, who have not
experienced this relief from the sucking of their offspring; and still
more so to understand how female birds were at first induced to
incubate their eggs for many weeks; and lastly how caterpillars, as of
the silk-worm, are induced to cover themselves with a well-woven house
of silk before their transformation.</p>

<p>These as well as many other animal facts, which are difficult to
account for, have been referred to an inexplicable instinct; which is
supposed to preclude any further investigation: but as animals seem to
have undergone great changes, as well as the inanimate parts of the
earth, and are probably still in a state of gradual improvement; it is
not unreasonable to conclude, that some of these actions both of large
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_040" name="page_n_040"></a>(p. 040)</span> animals and of insects, may have been acquired in a state
preceding their present one; and have been derived from the parents to
their offspring by imitation, or other kind of tradition; thus the
eggs of the crocodile are at this day hatched by the warmth of the sun
in Egypt; and the eggs of innumerable insects, and the spawn of fish,
and of frogs, in this climate are hatched by the vernal warmth: this
might be the case of birds in warm climates, in their early state of
existence; and experience might have taught them to incubate their
eggs, as they became more perfect animals, or removed themselves into
colder climates: thus the ostrich is said to sit upon its eggs only in
the night in warm situations, and both day and night in colder ones.</p>

<p>This love of the mother in quadrupeds to the offspring, whom she licks
and cleans, is so allied to the pleasure of the taste or palate, that
nature seems to have had a great escape in the parent quadruped not
devouring her offspring. Bitches, and cats, and sows, eat the
placenta; and if a dead offspring occurs, I am told, that also is
sometimes eaten, and yet the living offspring is spared; and by that
nice distinction the progenies of those animals are saved from
destruction!</p>

<p>"Certior factus sum a viro rebus antiquissimis docto, quod legitur in
Berosi operibus homines ante diluvium mulierum puerperarum placentam
edidisse, quasi cibum delicatum in epulis luxuriosis; et quod hoc
nefandissimo crimine movebatur Deus diluvio submergere terrarum
incolas." <span class="smcap">Anon.</span></p>

<p>It may be finally concluded, that this affection from the parent to
the progeny existed before animals were divided into sexes, and
produced the beginning of sympathetic society, the source of which may
perhaps be thus well accounted for; whenever the glandular system is
stimulated into greater natural action within certain limits, an
addition of pleasure is produced along with the increased secretion;
this pleasure arising from the activity of the system is supposed to
constitute the happiness of existence, in contradistinction to the
ennui or tædium vitæ; as shown in Zoonomia, Sect. XXXIII. 1.</p>

<p>Hence the secretion of nutritious juices occasioned by the stimulus of
an embryon or egg in the womb gives pleasure to the parent for a
length of time; whence by association a similar pleasure may be
occasioned to the parent by seeing and touching the egg or fetus after
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_041" name="page_n_041"></a>(p. 041)</span> its birth; and in lactescent animals an additional pleasure
is produced by the new secretion of milk, as well as by its emission
into the sucking lips of the infant. This appears to be one of the
great secrets of Nature, one of those fine, almost invisible cords,
which have bound one animal to another.</p>

<p>The females of lactiferous animals have thus a passion or inlet of
pleasure in their systems more than the males, from their power of
giving suck to their offspring; the want of the object of this
passion, either owing to the death of the progeny, or to the unnatural
fashion of their situation in life, not only deprives them of this
innocent and virtuous source of pleasure; but has occasioned diseases,
which have been fatal to many of them.</p>

<span class="left50"><span class="smcap">Canto II.</span> l. 140.</span></p>

<p class="p2">The mosaic history of Paradise and of Adam and Eve has been thought by
some to be a sacred allegory, designed to teach obedience to divine
commands, and to account for the origin of evil, like Jotham's fable
of the trees; Judges ix. 8. or Nathan's fable of the poor man and his
lamb; 2 Sam. xii. 1. or like the parables in the New Testament; as
otherwise knowledge could not be said to grow upon one tree, and life
upon another, or a serpent to converse; and lastly that this account
originated with the magi or philosophers of Egypt, with whom Moses was
educated, and that this part of the history, where Eve is said to have
been made from a rib of Adam might have been an hieroglyphic design of
the Egyptian philosophers, showing their opinion that Mankind was
originally of both sexes united, and was afterwards divided into males
and females: an opinion in later times held by Plato, and I believe by
Aristotle, and which must have arisen from profound inquiries into the
original state of animal existence.</p>

HEREDITARY DISEASES.</h4>

<p class="poem20">
  The feeble births acquired diseases chase,<br>
  Till Death extinguish the degenerate race.<br>
<span class="left50"><span class="smcap">Canto II.</span> l. 165.</span></p>

<p class="p2">As all the families both of plants and animals appear in a state of
perpetual improvement or degeneracy, it becomes a subject of
importance to detect the causes of these mutations.</p>

<p>The insects, which are not propagated by sexual intercourse, are so
few or so small, that no observations have been made on their
diseases; but hereditary diseases are believed more to affect the
offspring of solitary than of sexual generation in respect to
vegetables; as those fruit trees, which have for more than a century
been propagated only by ingrafting, and not from seeds, have been
observed by Mr. Knight to be at this time so liable to canker, as not
to be worth cultivation. From the same cause I suspect the degeneracy
of some potatoes and of some strawberries to have arisen; where the
curled leaf has appeared in the former, and barren flowers in the
latter.</p>

<p>This may arise from the progeny by solitary reproduction so much more
exactly resembling the parent, as is well seen in grafted trees
compared with seedling ones; the fruit of the former always resembling
that of the parent tree, but not so of the latter. The grafted scion
also accords with the branch of the tree from whence it was taken, in
the time of its bearing fruit; for if a scion be taken from a bearing
branch of a pear or apple tree, I believe, it will produce fruit even
the next year, or that succeeding; that is, in the same time that it
would have produced fruit, if it had continued growing on the parent
tree; but if the parent pear or apple tree has been cut down or
headed, and scions are then, taken from the young shoots of the stem,
and ingrafted; I believe those grafted trees will continue to grow for
ten or twelve years, before they bear fruit, almost as long as
seedling trees, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_044" name="page_n_044"></a>(p. 044)</span> that is they will require as much time, as
those new shoots from the lopped trunk would require, before they
produce fruit. It should thence be inquired, when grafted fruit trees
are purchased, whether the scions were taken from bearing branches, or
from the young shoots of a lopped trunk; as the latter, I believe, are
generally sold, as they appear stronger plants. This greater
similitude of the progeny to the parent in solitary reproduction must
certainly make them more liable to hereditary diseases, if such have
been acquired by the parent from unfriendly climate or bad
nourishment, or accidental injury.</p>

<p>In respect to the sexual progeny of vegetables it has long been
thought, that a change of seed or of situation is in process of time
necessary to prevent their degeneracy; but it is now believed, that it
is only changing for seed of a superior quality, that will better the
product. At the same time it may be probably useful occasionally to
intermix seeds from different situations together; as the anther-dust
is liable to pass from one plant to another in its vicinity; and by
these means the new seeds or plants may be amended, like the marriages
of animals into different families.</p>

<p>As the sexual progeny of vegetables are thus less liable to hereditary
diseases than the solitary progenies; so it is reasonable to conclude,
that the sexual progenies of animals may be less liable to hereditary
diseases, if the marriages are into different families, than if into
the same family; this has long been supposed to be true, by those who
breed animals for sale; since if the male and female be of different
temperaments, as these are extremes of the animal system, they may
counteract each other; and certainly where both parents are of
families, which are afflicted with the same hereditary disease, it is
more likely to descend to their posterity.</p>

<p>The hereditary diseases of this country have many of them been the
consequence of drinking much fermented or spirituous liquor; as the
gout always, most kinds of dropsy, and, I believe, epilepsy, and
insanity. But another material, which is liable to produce diseases in
its immoderate use, I believe to be common salt; the sea-scurvy is
evidently caused by it in long voyages; and I suspect the scrofula,
and consumption, to arise in the young progeny from the debility of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_045" name="page_n_045"></a>(p. 045)</span> the lymphatic and venous absorption produced in the parent
by this innutritious fossile stimulus. The petechiæ and vibices in the
sea-scurvy and occasional hæmorrhages evince the defect of venous
absorption; the occasional hæmoptoe at the commencement of pulmonary
consumption, seems also to arise from defect of venous absorption; and
the scrofula, which arises from the inactivity of the lymphatic
absorbent system, frequently exists along with pulmonary as well as
with mesenteric consumption. A tendency to these diseases is certainly
hereditary, though perhaps not the diseases themselves; thus a less
quantity of ale, cyder, wine, or spirit, will induce the gout and
dropsy in those constitutions, whose parents have been intemperate in
the use of those liquors; as I have more than once had occasion to
observe.</p>

<p>Finally the art to improve the sexual progeny of either vegetables or
animals must consist in choosing the most perfect of both sexes, that
is the most beautiful in respect to the body, and the most ingenious
in respect to the mind; but where one sex is given, whether male or
female, to improve a progeny from that person may consist in choosing
a partner of a contrary temperament.</p>

<p>As many families become gradually extinct by hereditary diseases, as
by scrofula, consumption, epilepsy, mania, it is often hazardous to
marry an heiress, as she is not unfrequently the last of a diseased
family.</p>

CHEMICAL THEORY OF ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM.</h4>

<p class="poem20">
  Then mark how two electric streams conspire<br>
  To form the resinous and vitreous fire.<br>
<span class="left50"><span class="smcap">Canto III.</span> l. 21.</span></p>

<p class="p2 center">I. <i>Of Attraction and Repulsion.</i></p>

<p>The motions, which accomplish the combinations and decompositions of
bodies, depend on the peculiar attractions and repulsions of the
particles of those bodies, or of the sides and angles of them; while
the motions of the sun and planets, of the air and ocean, and of all
bodies approaching to a general centre or retreating from it, depend
on the general attraction or repulsion of those masses of matter. The
peculiar attractions above mentioned are termed chemical affinities,
and the general attraction is termed gravitation; but the peculiar
repulsions of the particles of bodies, or the general repulsion of the
masses of matter, have obtained no specific names, nor have been
sufficiently considered; though they appear to be as powerful agents
as the attractions.</p>

<p>The motions of ethereal fluids, as of magnetism and electricity, are
yet imperfectly understood, and seem to depend both on chemical
affinity, and on gravitation; and also on the peculiar repulsions of
the particles of bodies, and on the general repulsion of the masses of
matter.</p>

<p>In what manner attraction and repulsion are produced has not yet been
attempted to be explained by modern philosophers; but as nothing can
act, where it does not exist, all distant attraction of the particles
of bodies, as well as general gravitation, must be ascribed to some
still finer ethereal fluid; which fills up all space between the suns
and their planets, as well as the interstices of coherent matter.
Repulsion in the same manner must consist of some finer ethereal
fluid; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_047" name="page_n_047"></a>(p. 047)</span> which at first projected the planets from the sun,
and I suppose prevents their return to it; and which occasionally
volatilizes or decomposes solid bodies into fluid or aerial ones, and
perhaps into ethereal ones.</p>

<p>May not the ethereal matter which constitutes repulsion, be the same
as the matter of heat in its diffused state; which in its quiescent
state is combined with various bodies, as appears from many chemical
explosions, in which so much heat is set at liberty? The ethereal
matter, which constitutes attraction, we are less acquainted with; but
it may also exist combined with bodies, as well as in its diffused
state; since the specific gravities of some metallic mixtures are said
not to accord with what ought to result from the combination of their
specific gravities, which existed before their mixture; but their
absolute gravities have not been attended to sufficiently; as these
have always been supposed to depend on their quantity of matter, and
situation in respect to the centre of the earth.</p>

<p>The ethereal fluids, which constitute peculiar repulsions and
attractions, appear to gravitate round the particles of bodies mixed
together; as those, which constitute the general repulsion or
attraction, appear to gravitate round the greater masses of matter
mixed together; but that which constitutes attraction seems to exist
in a denser state next to the particles or masses of matter; and that
which constitutes repulsion to exist more powerfully in a sphere
further from them; whence many bodies attract at one distance, and
repel at another. This may be observed by approaching to each other
two electric atmospheres round insulated cork-balls; or by pressing
globules of mercury, which roll on the surface, till they unite with
it; or by pressing the drops of water,' which stand on a cabbage leaf,
till they unite with it, and hence light is reflected from the surface
of a mirror without touching it.</p>

<p>Thus the peculiar attractions and repulsions of the particles of
bodies, and the general ones of the masses of matter, perpetually
oppose and counteract each other; whence if the power of attraction
should cease to act, all matter would be dissipated by the power of
repulsion into boundless space; and if heat, or the power of
repulsion, should cease to act, the whole world would become one solid
mass, condensed into a point.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_048" name="page_n_048"></a>(p. 048)</span> II. <i>Preliminary Propositions.</i></p>

<p>The following propositions concerning Electricity and Galvanism will
either be proved by direct experiments, or will be rendered probable
by their tending to explain or connect the variety of electric facts,
to which they will be applied.</p>

<p>1. There are two kinds of electric ether, which exist either
separately or in combination. That which is accumulated on the surface
of smooth glass, when it is rubbed with a cushion, is here termed
vitreous ether; and that which is accumulated on the surface of resin
or sealing-wax, when it is rubbed with a cushion, is here termed
resinous ether; and a combination of them, as in their usual state,
may be termed neutral electric ethers.</p>

<p>2. Atmospheres of vitreous or of resinous or of neutral electricity
surround all separate bodies, are attracted by them, and permeate
those, which are called conductors, as metallic and aqueous and
carbonic ones; but will not permeate those, which are termed
nonconductors, as air, glass, silk, resin, sulphur.</p>

<p>3. The particles of vitreous electric ether strongly repel each other
as they surround other bodies; but strongly attract the particles of
resinous electric ether: in similar manner the particles of the
resinous ether powerfully repel each other, and as powerfully attract
those of the vitreous ether. Hence in their separate state they appear
to occupy much greater space, as they, gravitate round insulated
bodies, and are then only cognizable by our senses or experiments.
They rush violently together through conducting substances, and then
probably possess much less space in this their combined state. They
thus resemble oxygen gas and nitrous gas; which rush violently
together when in contact; and occupy less space when united, than
either of them possessed separately before their union. When the two
electric ethers thus unite, a chemical explosion occurs, like an
ignited train of gunpowder; as they give out light and heat; and rend
or fuse the bodies they occupy; which cannot be accounted for on the
mechanical theory of Dr. Franklin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_049" name="page_n_049"></a>(p. 049)</span> 4. Glass holds within it in combination much resinous
electric ether, which constitutes a part of it, and which more
forcibly attracts vitreous electric ether from surrounding bodies,
which stands on it mixed with a less proportion of resinous ether like
an atmosphere, but cannot unite with the resinous ether, which is
combined with the glass; and resin, on the contrary, holds within it
in combination much vitreous electric ether, which constitutes a part
of it, and which more forcibly attracts resinous electric ether from
surrounding bodies, which stands on it mixed with a less proportion of
vitreous ether like an atmosphere, but cannot unite with the vitreous
ether, which is combined with the resin.</p>

<p>As in the production of vitrification, those materials are necessary
which contain much oxygen, as minium, and manganese; there is probably
much oxygen combined with glass, which may thence be esteemed a solid
acid, as water may be esteemed a fluid one. It is hence not
improbable, that one kind of electric ether may also be combined with
it, as it seems to affect the oxygen of water in the Galvanic
experiments. The combination of the other kind of electric ether with
wax or sulphur, is countenanced from those bodies, when heated or
melted, being said to part with much electricity as they cool, and as
it appears to affect the hydrogen in the decomposition of water by
Galvanism.</p>

<p>5. Hence the nonconductors of electricity are of two kinds; such as
are combined with vitreous ether, as resin, and sulphur; and such as
are combined with resinous ether, as glass, air, silk. But both these
kinds of nonconductors are impervious to either of the electric
ethers; as those ethers being already combined with other bodies will
not unite with each other, or be removed from their situations by each
other. Whereas the perfect conducting bodies, as metals, water,
charcoal, though surrounded with electric atmospheres, as they have
neither of the electric ethers combined with them, suffer them to
permeate and pass through them, whether separately or in their neutral
state of reciprocal combination.</p>

<p>But it is probable, that imperfect conductors may possess more or less
of either the vitreous or resinous ether combined with them, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_050" name="page_n_050"></a>(p. 050)</span>
since their natural atmospheres are dissimilar as mentioned below; and
that this makes them more or less imperfect conductors.</p>

<p>6. Those bodies which are perfect conductors, have probably neutral
electric atmospheres gravitating round them consisting of an equal or
saturated mixture of the two electric ethers, whereas the atmospheres
round the nonconducting bodies probably consist of an unequal mixture
of the electric ethers, as more of the vitreous one round glass, and
more of the resinous one round resin; and, it is probable, that these
mixed atmospheres, which surround imperfect conducting bodies, consist
also of different proportions of the vitreous and resinous ethers,
according to their being more or less perfect conductors. These minute
degrees of the difference of these electric atmospheres are evinced by
Mr. Bennet's Doubler of Electricity, as shown in his work, and are
termed by him Adhesive Electric Atmospheres, to distinguish them from
those accumulated by art; thus the natural adhesive electricity of
silver is more of the vitreous kind compared with that of zinc, which
consists of a greater proportion of the resinous; that is, in his
language, silver is positive and zinc negative. This experiment I have
successfully repeated with Mr. Bennet's Doubler along with Mr.
Swanwick.</p>

<p>7. Great accumulation or condensation of the separate electric ethers
attract each other so strongly, that they will break a passage through
nonconducting bodies, as through a plate of glass, or of air, and will
rend bodies which are less perfect conductors, and give out light and
heat like the explosion of a train of gunpowder; whence, when a strong
electric shock is passed through a quire of paper, a bur, or elevation
of the sheets, is seen on both sides of it occasioned by the
explosion. Whence trees and stone walls are burst by lightning, and
wires are fused, and inflammable bodies burnt, by the heat given out
along with the flash of light, which cannot be explained by the
mechanic theory.</p>

<p>8. When artificial or natural accumulations of these separate ethers
are very minute in quantity or intensity, they pass slowly and with
difficulty from one body to another, and require the best conductors
for this purpose; whence many of the phenomena of the torpedo or
gymnotus, and of Galvanism. Thus after having discharged a coated
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_051" name="page_n_051"></a>(p. 051)</span> jar, if the communicating wire has been quickly withdrawn, a
second small shock may be taken after the principal discharge, and
this repeatedly two or three times.</p>

<p>Hence the charge of the Galvanic pile being very minute in quantity or
intensity, will not readily pass through the dry cuticle of the hands,
though it so easily passes through animal flesh or nerves, as this
combination of charcoal with water seems to constitute the most
perfect conductor yet known.</p>

<p>9. As light is reflected from the surface of a mirror before it
actually touches it, and as drops of water are repelled from cabbage
leaves without touching them, and as oil lies on water without
touching it, and also as a fine needle may be made to lie on water
without touching it, as shown by Mr. Melville in the Literary Essays
of Edinburgh; there is reason to believe, that the vitreous and
resinous electric ethers are repelled by, or will not pass through,
the surfaces of glass or resin, to which they are applied. But though
neither of these electric ethers passes through the surfaces of glass
or resin, yet their attractive or repulsive powers pass through them:
as the attractive or repulsive power of the magnet to iron passes
through the atmosphere, and all other bodies which exist between them.
So an insulated cork-ball, when electrised either with vitreous or
resinous ether, repels another insulated cork-ball electrised with the
same kind of ether, through half an inch of common air, though these
electric atmospheres do not unite.</p>

<p>Whence it may be concluded, that the general attractive and repulsive
ethers accompany the electric ethers as well as they accompany all
other bodies; and that the electric ethers do not themselves attract
or repel through glass or resin, as they cannot pass through them, but
strongly attract each other when they come into contact, rush
together, and produce an explosion of the sudden liberation of heat
and light.</p>


<p class="p2 center">III. <i>Effect of Metallic Points.</i></p>

<p>1. When a pointed wire is presented by a person standing on the ground
to an insulated conductor, on which either vitreous or resinous
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_052" name="page_n_052"></a>(p. 052)</span> electricity is accumulated, the accumulated electricity will
pass off at a much greater distance than if a metallic knob be fixed
on the wire and presented in its stead.</p>

<p>2. The same occurs if the metallic point be fixed on the electrised
conductor, and the finger of a person standing on the ground be
presented to it, the accumulated electricity will pass off at a much
greater distance, and indeed will soon discharge itself by
communicating the accumulated electricity to the atmosphere.</p>

<p>3. If a metallic point be fixed on the prime conductor, and the flame
of a candle be presented to it, on electrising the conductor either
with vitreous or resinous ether, the flame of the candle is blown from
the point, which must be owing to the electric fluid in its passage
from the point carrying along with it a stream of atmospheric air.</p>

<p>The manner in which the accumulated electricity so readily passes off
by a metallic point may be thus understood; when a metallic point
stands erect from an electrised metallic plane, the accumulated
electricity which exists on the extremity of the point, is attracted
less than that on the other parts of the electrised surface. For the
particle of electric matter immediately over the point is attracted by
that point only, whereas the particles of electric matter over every
other part of the electrised plane, is not only attracted by the parts
of the plane immediately under them, but also laterally by the
circumjacent parts of it; whence the accumulated electric fluid is
pushed off at this point by that over the other parts being more
strongly attracted to the plane.</p>

<p>Thus if a light insulated horizontal fly be constructed of wire with
points fixed as tangents to the circle, it will revolve the way
contrary to the direction of the points as long as it continues to be
electrised. For the same reason as when a circle of cork, with a point
of the cork standing from it like a tangent, is smeared with oil, and
thrown upon a lake, it will continue to revolve backwards in respect
to the direction of the point till all the oil is dispersed upon the
lake, as first observed by Dr. Franklin; for the oil being attracted
to all the other parts of the cork-circle more than towards the
pointed tangent, that part over the point is pushed off and diffuses
itself on the water, over which it passes without touching, and
consequently without friction; and thus the cork revolves in the
contrary direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_053" name="page_n_053"></a>(p. 053)</span> As the flame of a candle is blown from a point fixed on an
electrised conductor, whether vitreous or resinous electricity is
accumulated on it, it shows that in both cases electricity passes from
the point, which is a forcible argument against the mechanical theory
of positive and negative electricity; because then the flame should be
blown towards the point in one case, and from it in the other.</p>

<p>So the electric fly, as it turns horizontally, recedes from the
direction of the points of the tangents, whether it be electrised with
vitreous or resinous electricity; whereas if it was supposed to
receive electricity, when electrised by resin, and to part with it
when electrised by glass, it ought to revolve different ways; which
also forcibly opposes the theory of positive and negative electricity.</p>

<p>As an electrised point with either kind of electricity causes a stream
of air to pass from it in the direction of the point, it seems to
affect the air much in the same manner as the fluid matter of heat
affects it; that is, it will not readily pass through it, but will
adhere to the particles of air, and is thus carried away with them.</p>

<p>From this it will also appear, that points do not attract electricity,
properly speaking, but suffer it to depart from them; as it is there
less attracted to the body which it surrounds, than by any other part
of the surface.</p>

<p>And as a point presented to an electrised conductor facilitates the
discharge of it, and blows the flame of a candle towards the
conductor, whether vitreous or resinous electricity be accumulated
upon it; it follows, that in both cases some electric matter passes
from the point to the conductor, and that hence there are two electric
ethers; and that they combine or explode when they meet together, and
give out light and heat, and occupy less space in this their combined
state, like the union of nitrous gas with oxygen gas.</p>


<p class="p2 center">IV. <i>Accumulation of Electric Ethers by Contact.</i>

<p>The electric ethers may be separately accumulated by contact of
conductors with nonconductors, by vicinity of the two ethers, by heat,
and by decomposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_054" name="page_n_054"></a>(p. 054)</span> Glass is believed to consist in part of consolidated resinous
ether, and thence to attract an electric atmosphere round it, which
consists of a greater proportion of vitreous ether compared to the
quantity of the resinous, as mentioned in Proposition No. 4. This
atmosphere may stand off a line from the surface of the glass, though
its attractive or repulsive power may extend to a much greater
distance; and a more equally mixed electric atmosphere may stand off
about the same distance from the surface of a cushion.</p>

<p>Now when a cushion is forcibly pressed upon the surface of a glass
cylinder or plane, the atmosphere of the cushion is forced within that
of the glass, and consequently the vitreous part of it is brought
within the sphere of the attraction of the resinous ether combined
with the glass, and therefore becomes attracted by it in addition to
the vitreous part of the spontaneous atmosphere of the glass; and the
resinous part of the atmosphere of the cushion is at the same time
repelled by its vicinity to the combined resinous ether of the glass.
From both which circumstances a vitreous ether alone surrounds the
part of the glass on which the cushion is forcibly pressed; which does
not, nevertheless, resemble an electrised coated jar; as this
accumulation of vitreous ether on one side of the glass is not so
violently condensed, or so forcibly attracted to the glass by the
loose resinous ether on the other side of it, as occurs in the charged
coated jar.</p>

<p>Hence as weak differences of the kinds or quantities of electricity do
not very rapidly change place, if the cushion be suddenly withdrawn,
with or without friction, I suppose an accumulation of vitreous
electric ether will be left on the surface of the glass, which will
diffuse itself on an insulated conductor by the assistance of points,
or will gradually be dissipated in the air, probably like odours by
the repulsion of its own particles, or may be conducted away by the
surrounding air as it is repelled from it, or by the moisture or other
impurities of the atmosphere. And hence I do not suppose the friction
of the glass-globe to be necessary, except for the purpose of more
easily removing the parts of the surface from the pressure of the
cushion to the points of the prime conductor, and to bring them more
easily into reciprocal contact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_055" name="page_n_055"></a>(p. 055)</span> When sealing wax or sulphur is rubbed by a cushion, exactly
the same circumstance occurs, but with the different ethers; as the
resinous ether of the spontaneous atmosphere of the cushion, when it
is pressed within the spontaneous atmosphere of the sealing wax, is
attracted by the solid vitreous ether, which is combined with it; and
at the same time the vitreous ether of the cushion is repelled by it;
and hence an atmosphere of resinous ether alone exists between the
sealing wax and the cushion thus pressed together. It is nevertheless
possible, that friction on both sealing wax and glass may add some
facility to the accumulations of their opposite ethers by the warmth
which it occasions. As most electric machines succeed best after being
warmed, I think even in dry frosty seasons.</p>

<p>Though when a cushion is applied to a smooth surfaced glass, so as to
intermix their electric atmospheres, the vitreous ether of the cushion
is attracted by the resinous ether combined with the glass; but does
not intermix with it, but only adheres to it: and as the glass turns
round, the vitreous electric atmosphere stands on the solid resinous
electric ether combined with the glass; and is taken away by the
metallic points of the prime conductor.</p>

<p>Yet if the surface of the glass be roughened by scratching it with a
diamond or with hard sand, a new event occurs; which is, that the
vitreous ether attracted from the cushion by the resinous ether
combined with the glass becomes adhesive to it; and stands upon the
roughened glass, and will not quit the glass to go to the prime
conductor; whence the surface of the glass having a vitreous electric
atmosphere united, as it were, to its inequalities, becomes similar to
resin; and will now attract resinous electric ether, like a stick of
sealing wax, without combining with it. Whence this curious and
otherwise unintelligible phenomenon, that smooth surfaced glass will
give vitreous electric ether to an insulated conductor, and glass with
a roughened surface will give resinous ether to it.</p>


<p class="p2 center">V. <i>Accumulation of electric ethers by vicinity.</i></p>

<p>Though the contact of a cushion on the whirling glass is the easiest
method yet in use for the accumulation of the vitreous electric ether
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_056" name="page_n_056"></a>(p. 056)</span> on an insulated conductor; yet there are other methods of
effecting this, as by the vicinity of the two electric ethers with a
nonconductor between them.</p>

<p>Thus I believe a great quantity of both vitreous and resinous electric
ether may be accumulated in the following manner. Let a glass jar be
coated within in the usual manner; but let it have a loose external
coating, which can easily be withdrawn by an insulating handle. Then
charge the jar, as highly as it may be, by throwing into it vitreous
electric ether; and in this state hermetically seal it, if
practicable, otherwise close it with a glass stopple and wax. When the
external coating is drawn off by an insulating handle, having
previously had a communication with the earth, it will possess an
accumulation of resinous electric ether; and then touching it with
your finger, a spark will be seen, and there will cease to be any
accumulated ether.</p>

<p>Thus by alternately replacing this loose coating, and withdrawing it
from the sealed charged jar, by means of an insulating handle; and by
applying it to one insulated conductor, when it is in the vicinity of
the jar; and to another insulated conductor, when it is withdrawn;
vitreous electric ether may be accumulated on one of them, and
resinous on the other; and thus I suspect an immense quantity of both
ethers may be produced without friction or much labour, if a large
electric battery was so contrived; and that it might be applied to
many mechanical purposes, where other explosions are now used, as in
the place of steam engines, or to rend rocks, or timber, or destroy
invading armies!</p>

<p>The principle of this mode of accumulating the two electric ethers in
some measure resembles that of Volta's Electrophorus and Bennet's
Doubler.</p>


<p class="p2 center">VI. <i>Accumulation of electric ethers by heat and by decomposition.</i></p>

<p>When glass or amber is heated by the fire in a dry season, I suspect
that it becomes in some degree electric; as either of the electric
ethers which is combined with them may have its combination with those
materials loosened by the application of heat; and that on <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_057" name="page_n_057"></a>(p. 057)</span>
this account they may more forcibly attract the opposite one from the
air in their vicinity.</p>

<p>It has long been known, that a siliceous stone called the tourmalin,
when its surfaces are polished, if it be laid down before the fire,
will become electrified with vitreous, or what is called positive
electricity on its upper surface; and resinous, or what is called
negative electricity on its under surface; which I suppose lay in
contact with somewhat which supported it near the fire.</p>

<p>In this experiment I suppose the tourmalin to be naturally combined
with resinous electric ether like glass; which on one side next
towards the fire by the increase of its attractive power, owing to the
heat having loosened its combination with the earth of the stone, more
strongly attracts vitreous electric ether from the atmosphere; which
now stands on its surface: and then as the lower surface of the stone
lies in contact with the hearth, the less quantity of vitreous ether
is there repelled by the greater quantity of it on the upper surface;
while the resinous ether is attracted by it: and the stone is thus
charged like a coated jar with vitreous electric ether condensed on
one side of it, and resinous on the other.</p>

<p>So cats, as they lie by the fire in a frosty day, become so electric
as frequently to give a perceptible spark to one's finger from their
ears without friction.</p>

<p>A fourth method of separating the two ethers would seem to be by the
decomposition of metallic bodies, as in the experiment with Volta's
Galvanic pile; which is said by Mr. Davy to act so much more
powerfully, when an acid is added to the water used in the experiment;
as will be spoken of below.</p>

<p>From experiments made by M. Saussure on the electricity of evaporated
water from hot metallic vessels, and from those of china and glass, he
found when the vessel was calcined or made rusty by the evaporating
water, that the electricity of it was positive (or vitreous), and that
from china or glass was negative (or resinous), Encyclop. Britan. Art.
Elect. No. 206, which seems also to show, that vitreous electric ether
was given out or produced by the corrosion of metals, and resinous
ether from the evaporation of water.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_058" name="page_n_058"></a>(p. 058)</span> VII. <i>The spark from the conductor, and of electric light.</i></p>

<p>When either the vitreous or resinous electric ether is accumulated on
an insulated conductor, and an uninsulated conductor, as the finger of
an attendant, is applied nearly in contact with it, what happens? The
attractive and repulsive powers of the accumulated electric ether pass
through the nonconducting plate of air, and if it be of the vitreous
kind, it attracts the resinous electric ether of the finger towards
it, and repels the vitreous electric ether of the finger from it.</p>

<p>Hence there exists for an instant a charged plate of air between the
finger and the prime conductor, with an accumulation of vitreous ether
on one side of it, and of resinous ether on the other side of it; and
lastly these two kinds of electric ethers suddenly unite by their
powerful attraction of each other, explode, and give out heat and
light, and rupture the plate of nonconducting air, which separated
them.</p>

<p>The rupture or disjunction of the plate of air is known by the sound
of the spark, as of thunder; which shows that a vacuum of air was
previously produced by the explosion of the electric fluids, and a
vibration of the air in consequence of the sudden joining again of the
sides of the vacuum.</p>

<p>The light which attends electric sparks and shocks, is not accounted
for by the Theory of Dr. Franklin. I suspect that it is owing to the
combination of the two electric ethers, from which as from all
chemical explosions both light and heat are set at liberty, and
because a smell is said to be perceptible from electric sparks, and
even a taste which must be deduced from new combinations, or
decompositions, as in other explosions: add to this that the same
thing occurs, when electric shocks are passed through eggs in the
dark, or through water, a luminous line is seen like the explosion of
a train of gunpowder; lastly, whether light is really produced in the
passage of the Galvanic electricity through the eyes, or that the
sensation alone of light is perceived by its stimulating the optic
nerve, has not yet been investigated; but I suspect the former, as it
emits light from its explosion <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_059" name="page_n_059"></a>(p. 059)</span> even in passing through eggs
and through water, as mentioned above.</p>


<p class="p2 center">VIII. <i>The shock from the coated jar, and of electric condensation.</i></p>

<p>1. When a glass jar is coated on both sides, and either vitreous or
resinous electricity is thrown upon the coating on one side, and there
is a communication to the earth from the other side, the same thing
happens as in the plate of air between the finger and prime conductor
above described; that is, the accumulated electricity, if it be of the
vitreous kind, on one coating of the glass jar will attract the
resinous part of the electricity, which surrounds or penetrates the
coating on the other side of the jar, and also repel the vitreous part
of it; but this occurs on a much more extensive surface than in the
instance of the plate of air between the finger and prime conductor.</p>

<p>The difference between electric sparks and shocks consists in this
circumstance, that in the former the insulating medium, whether of
air, or of thin glass, is ruptured in one part, and thus a
communication is made between the vitreous and resinous ethers, and
they unite immediately, like globules of quicksilver, when pressed
forcibly together: but in the electric shock a communication is made
by some conducting body applied to the other extremities of the
vitreous, and of the resinous atmospheres, through which they pass and
unite, whether both sides of the coated jar are insulated, or only one
side of it.</p>

<p>And in this line, as they reciprocally meet, they appear to explode
and give out light and heat, and a new combination of the two ethers
is produced, as a residuum after the explosion, which probably
occupies much less space than either the vitreous or resinous ethers
did separately before. At the same time there may be another
unrestrainable ethereal fluid yet unobserved, given out from this
explosion, which rends oak trees, bursts stone-walls, lights
inflammable substances, and fuses metals, or dissipates them in a
calciform smoak, along with which great light and much heat are
emitted, or these effects are produced by the heat and light only thus
set at liberty by their synchronous and sudden evolution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_060" name="page_n_060"></a>(p. 060)</span> 2. The curious circumstance of electric condensation appears
from the violence of the shock of the coated jar compared with the
strongest spark from an insulated conductor, though the latter
possesses a much greater surface; when vitreous electric ether is
thrown on one side of a coated jar, it attracts the resinous electric
ether of the other side of the coated jar; and the same occurs, when
resinous ether is thrown on one side of it, it attracts the vitreous
ether of the other side of it, and thus the vitreous electric ether on
one side of the jar, and the resinous ether on the other side of it
become condensed, that is accumulated in less space, by their
reciprocal attraction of each other.</p>

<p>This condensation of the two electric ethers owing to their reciprocal
attraction appears from another curious event, that the thinner the
glass jar is, the stronger will the charge be on the same quantity of
surface, as then the two ethers approaching nearer without their
intermixing attract each other stronger, and consequently condense
each other more. And when the glass jar is very thin the reciprocal
attractive powers of the vitreous and resinous ether attract each
other so violently as at length to pass through the glass by rupturing
it, in the same manner as a less forcible attraction of them ruptures
and passes through the plate of air in the production of sparks from
the prime conductor.</p>

<p>As these two ethers on each side of a charged coated jar so powerfully
attract each other, when a communication is made between them by some
conducting substance as in the common mode of discharging an
electrised coated jar, they reciprocally pass to each other for the
purpose of combining, as some chemical fluids are known to do; as when
nitrous gas and oxygen gas are mixed together; whence as these fluids
pass both ways to intermix with each other, and then explode; a bur
appears on each side of a quire of paper well pressed together, when a
strong electric shock is passed through it; which is occasioned by
their explosion, like a train of gunpowder, and consequent emission of
some other ethereal fluid, either those of heat and light or of some
new one not yet observed. Whence it becomes difficult to explain,
according to the theory of Dr. Franklin, which way the electric fluid
passed; and which side of the coated jar contained positive and which
the negative charge according to that doctrine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_061" name="page_n_061"></a>(p. 061)</span> But the theory of the ingenious Dr. Franklin failed also in
explaining other phenomena of the coated jar; since if the positive
electricity accumulated on one side of the jar repelled the
electricity from the coating on the other side of it, so as to produce
an electric vacuum; why should it be so eager, when a communication is
made by some conducting body, to run into that vacuum by its
attraction or gravitation, which has been made by its repulsion; as
thus it seems to be violently attracted by the vacuum, from which it
had previously repelled a fluid similar to itself, which is not easily
to be comprehended.</p>

<p>3. There is another mode by which either vitreous or resinous electric
ether is capable of condensation; which consists in contracting the
volume, so as to diminish the surface of the electrised body; as was
ingeniously shown by Dr. Franklin's experiment of electrising a silver
tankard with a length of chain rolled up within it; and then drawing
up the chain by a silk string, which weakened the electric attraction
of the tankard; which was strengthened again by returning the chain
into it; thus the condensation of an electrised cloud is believed to
condense the electric ether, which it contains, and thus to occasion
the lightning passing from one cloud to another, or from a cloud into
the earth.</p>

<p>This experiment of the chain and tankard is said to succeed as well
with what is termed negative electricity in the theory of Dr.
Franklin, as with what is termed positive electricity; but in that
theory the negative electricity means a less quantity or total
deprivation or vacuity of that fluid; now to condense negative
electricity by lowering the suspended chain into the tankard ought to
make it less negative; whereas in this experiment I am told it becomes
more so, as appears by its stronger repulsion of cork balls suspended
on silk strings, and previously electrised by rubbed sealing wax: and
if the negative electricity be believed to be a perfect vacuum of it,
the condensation of a vacuum of electricity is totally
incomprehensible; and this experiment alone seems to demonstrate the
existence of two electric ethers.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_062" name="page_n_062"></a>(p. 062)</span> IX. <i>Of Galvanic Electricity.</i></p>

<p>1. The conductors of electricity, as well as the nonconductors of it,
have probably a portion of the vitreous and resinous ethers combined
with them, and have also another portion of these ethers diffused
round them, which forms their natural or spontaneous adhesive
atmospheres; and which exists in different proportions round them
correspondent in quantity to those which are combined with them, but
opposite in kind.</p>

<p>These adhesive spontaneous atmospheres of electricity are shown to
consist of different proportions or quantities of the electric ethers
by Mr. Bennet's Doubler of Electricity, as mentioned in his work
called New Experiments on Electricity, sold by Johnson. In this work,
p. 91, the blade of a steel knife was evidently, in his language,
positive, compared to a soft iron wire which was comparatively
negative; so the adhesive electricity of gold, silver, copper, brass,
bismuth, mercury, and various kinds of wood and stone, were what he
terms positive or vitreous; and that of tin and zinc, what he terms
negative or resinous.</p>

<p>Where these spontaneous atmospheres of diffused electricity
surrounding two conducting bodies, as two pieces of silver, are
perfectly similar, they probably do not intermix when brought into the
vicinity of each other; but if these spontaneous atmospheres of
diffused electricity are different in respect to the proportion of the
two ethers, or perhaps in respect to their quantity, in however small
degree either of these circumstances exists, they may be made to unite
but with some difficulty; as the two metallic plates, suppose one of
silver, and another of zinc, which they surround, must be brought into
absolute or adhesive contact; or otherwise these atmospheres may be
forced together so as to be much flattened, and compress each other
where they meet, like small globules of quicksilver when pressed
together, but without uniting.</p>

<p>This curious phenomenon may be seen in more dense electric atmospheres
accumulated by art, as in the following experiment ascribed to Mr.
Canton. Lay a wooden skewer the size of a goose-quill <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_063" name="page_n_063"></a>(p. 063)</span>
across a dry wine-glass, and another across another wine-glass; let
the ends of them touch each other, as they lie in a horizontal line;
call them X and Y; approach a rubbed glass-tube near the external end
of the skewer X, but not so as to touch it; then separate the two
skewers by removing the wine-glasses further from each other; and
lastly, withdraw the rubbed glass-tube, and the skewer X will now be
found to possess resinous electricity, which has been generally called
negative or minus electricity; and the skewer Y will be found to
possess vitreous, or what is generally termed positive or plus
electricity.</p>

<p>The same phenomenon will occur if rubbed sealing wax be applied near
to, but not in contact with, the skewer X, as the skewer X will then
be left with an atmosphere of vitreous ether, and the skewer Y with
one of resinous ether. These experiments also evince the existence of
two electric fluids, as they cannot be understood from an idea of one
being a greater or less quantity of the same material; as a vacuum of
electric ether, brought near to one end of the skewer, cannot be
conceived so to attract the ether as to produce a vacuum at the other
end.</p>

<p>In this experiment the electric atmospheres, which are nearly of
similar kinds, do not seem to touch, as there may remain a thin plate
of air between them, in the same manner as small globules of mercury
may be pressed together so as to compress each other, long before they
intermix; or as plates of lead or brass require strongly to be pressed
together before they acquire the attraction of cohesion; that is,
before they come into real contact.</p>

<p>2. It is probable, that all bodies are more or less perfect
conductors, as they have less or more of either of the electric ethers
combined with them; as mentioned in Preliminary Proposition, No. VI.
as they may then less resist the passage of either of the ethers
through them. Whence some conducting bodies admit the junction of
these spontaneous electric atmospheres, in which the proportions or
quantities of the two ethers are not very different, with greater
facility than others.</p>

<p>Thus in the common experiments, where the vitreous or resinous ether
is accumulated by art, metallic bodies have been esteemed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_064" name="page_n_064"></a>(p. 064)</span>
the best conductors, and next to these water, and all other moist
bodies; but it was lately discovered, that dry charcoal, recently
burnt, was a more perfect conductor than metals; and it appears from
the experiments discovered by Galvani, which have thence the name of
Galvanism, that animal flesh, and particularly perhaps the nerves of
animals, both which are composed of much carbon and water, are the
most perfect conductors yet discovered; that is, that they give the
least resistance to the junction of the spontaneous electric
atmospheres, which exist round metallic bodies, and which differ very
little in respect to the proportions of their vitreous and resinous
ingredients.</p>

<p>Thus also, though where the accumulated electricities are dense, as in
charging a coated glass-jar, the glass, which intervenes, may be of
considerable thickness, and may still become charged by the stronger
attraction of the secondary electric ethers; but where the spontaneous
adhesive electric atmospheres are employed to charge plates of air, as
in the Galvanic pile, or probably to charge thin animal membranes or
cuticles, as perhaps in the shock given by the torpedo or gymnotus, it
seems necessary that the intervening nonconducting plate must be
extremely thin, that it may become charged by the weaker attraction of
these small quantities or difference of the spontaneous electric
atmospheres; and in this circumstance only, I suppose, the shocks from
the Galvanic pile, and from the torpedo and gymnotus, differ from
those of the coated jar.</p>

<p>3. When atmospheres of electricity, which do not differ much in the
quantity or proportion of their vitreous and resinous ethers, approach
each other, they are not easily or rapidly united; but the predominant
vitreous or resinous ether of one of them repels the similar ether of
the opposed atmosphere, and attracts the contrary kind of ether.</p>

<p>The slowness or difficulty with, which atmospheres, which differ but
little in kind or in density, unite with each other, appears not only
from the experiment of Mr. Canton above related, but also from the
repeated smaller shocks, which may be taken from a charged coated jar
after the first or principal discharge, if the conducting medium has
not been quickly removed, as is also mentioned above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_065" name="page_n_065"></a>(p. 065)</span> Hence those atmospheres of either kind of electric matter,
which differ but very little from each other in kind or quantity,
require the most perfect conductors to cause them to unite. Thus it
appears by Mr. Bennet's doubler, as mentioned in the Preliminary
Proposition, No. VI. that the natural adhesive atmosphere round silver
contains more vitreous electricity than that naturally round zinc; but
when thin plates of these metals, each about an ounce in weight, are
laid on each other, or moderately pressed together, their atmospheres
do not unite. For metallic plates, which when laid on each other, do
not adhere, cannot be said to be in real contact, of which their not
adhering is a proof; and in consequence a thin plate of air, or of
their own repulsive ethers exists between them.</p>

<p>Hence when two plates of zinc and silver are thus brought in to the
vicinity of each other, the plate of air between them, as they are not
in adhesive contact, becomes like a charged coated jar; and if these
two metallic plates are touched by your dry hands, they do not unite
their electricities, as the dry cuticle is not a sufficiently good
conductor; but if one of the metals be put above, and another under
the tongue, the saliva and moist mucous membrane, muscular fibres, and
nerves, supply so good a conductor, that this very minute electric
shock is produced, and a kind of pungent taste is perceived.</p>

<p>When a plate or pencil of silver is put between the upper lip and the
gum, and a plate or pencil of zinc under the tongue, a sensation of
light is perceived in the eyes, as often as the exterior extremities
of these metals are brought into contact; which is owing in like
manner to the discharge of a very minute electric shock, which would
not have been produced but by the intervention of such good conductors
as moist membranes, muscular fibres, and nerves.</p>

<p>In this situation, a sensation of light is produced in the eyes; which
seems to show, that these ethers pass through nerves more easily, than
through muscular flesh simply; since the passage of them through the
retina of the eyes from the upper gum to the parts beneath the tongue
is a more distant one, than would otherwise appear necessary. It is
not so easy to give the sensation of light in the eyes by passing a
small shock of artificially accumulated electricity through, the eyes
(though this may, I believe, be done) because this artificial
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_066" name="page_n_066"></a>(p. 066)</span> accumulated electricity, as it passes with greater velocity
than the spontaneous accumulations of it, will readily permeate the
muscles or other moist parts of animal bodies; whereas the spontaneous
accumulations of electricity seem to require the best of all
conductors, as animal nerves, to facilitate their passage.</p>

<p>4. In the Galvanic pile of Volta this electric shock becomes so much
increased, as to pass by less perfect conductors, and to give shocks
to the arms of the conducting person, if the cuticle of his hands be
moistened, and even to show sparks like the coated jar; which appears
to be effected in this manner. When a plate of silver is laid
horizontally on a plate of zinc, the plate of air between them becomes
charged like a coated jar; as the silver, naturally possessing more
vitreous electric ether, repels the vitreous ether, which the zinc
possesses in less quantity, and attracts the resinous ether of the
zinc. Whence the inferior surface of the plate of zinc abounds now
with vitreous ether, and its upper surface with resinous ether.
Beneath this pair of plates lay a cloth moistened with water, or with
some better conductor, as salt and water, or a slight acid mixed with
water, or volatile alcali of ammoniac mixed with water, and this
vitreous electric ether on the lower surface of the zinc plate will be
given to the second silver plate which lies beneath it; and thus this
second silver plate will possess not only its own natural vitreous
atmosphere, which was denser or in greater quantity than that of the
zinc plate next beneath it, but now acquires an addition of vitreous
ether from the zinc plate above it, conducted to it through the moist
cloth.</p>

<p>This then will repel more vitreous ether from the second zinc plate
into the third silver one; and so on till the plates of air between
the zincs and silvers are all charged, and each stronger and stronger,
as they descend in the pile.</p>

<p>If the reader still prefers the Franklinian theory of positive and
negative electricity, he will please to put the word positive for
vitreous, and negative for resinous, and he will find the theory of
the Galvanic pile equally thus accounted for.</p>

<p>5. When a Galvanic pile is thus placed, and a communication between
the two ends of it is made by wires, so that the electric shocks pass
through water, the water becomes decomposed in some measure, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_067" name="page_n_067"></a>(p. 067)</span>
and oxygen is liberated from it at the point of one wire, and hydrogen
at the point of the other; and this though a syphon of water be
interposed between them. This curious circumstance seems to evince the
existence of two electric ethers, which enter the water at different
ends of the syphon, and have chemical affinities to the component
parts of it; the resinous ether sets at liberty the hydrogen at one
end, and the vitreous ether the oxygen at the other end of the
conducting medium.</p>

<p>Hence it must appear, that the longer the Galvanic pile, or the
greater the number of the alternate pieces of silver and zinc that it
consists of, the stronger will be the Galvanic shock; but there is
another circumstance, difficult to explain, which is the perpetual
decomposition of water by the Galvanic pile; when water is made the
conducting medium between the two extremities of the pile.</p>

<p>As no conductors of electricity are absolutely perfect, there must be
produced a certain accumulation of vitreous ether on one side of each
charged plate of the Galvanic pile, and of resinous ether on the other
side of it, before the discharge takes place, even though the
conducting medium be in apparent contact. When the discharge does take
place, the whole of the accumulated electricity explodes and vanishes;
and then an instant of time is required for the silver and zinc again
to attract from the air, or other bodies in their vicinity, their
spontaneous natural atmospheres, and then another discharge ensues;
and so repeatedly and perpetually till the surface of one of the
metallic plates becomes so much oxydated or calcined, that it ceases
to act.</p>

<p>Hence a perpetual motion may be said to be produced, with an incessant
decomposition of water into the two gasses of oxygen and hydrogen;
which must probably be constantly proceeding on all moist Surfaces,
where a chain of electric conductors exists, surrounded with different
proportions of the two electric ethers. Whence the ceaseless
liberation of oxygen from the water has oxydated or calcined the ores
of metals near the surface of the earth, as of manganese, of zinc into
lapis calaminaris, of iron into various ochres, and other calciform
ores. From this source also the corrosion of some metals may be
traced, when they are immersed in water in the vicinity of each
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_068" name="page_n_068"></a>(p. 068)</span> other, as when the copper sheathing of ships was held on by
iron nails. And hence another great operation of nature is probably
produced, I mean the restoration of oxygen to the atmosphere from the
surface of the earth in dewy mornings, as well as from the
perspiration of vegetable leaves; which atmospheric oxygen is hourly
destructible by the respiration of animals and plants, by combustion,
and by other oxydations.</p>

<p>6. The combination of the electric ethers with metallic bodies, before
mentioned appears from the Galvanic pile; since, according to the
experiments of Mr. Davy, when an acid is mixed with the water placed
between the alternate pairs of silver and zinc plates, a much greater
electric shock is produced by the same pile; and an anonymous writer
in the Phil. Magaz. No. 36, for May 1801, asserts, that when the
intervening cloths or papers are moistened with pure alcali, as a
solution of pure ammonia, the effect is greater than by any other
material. It must here be observed, that both the acid and the
alcaline solution, or common salt and water, and even water alone, in
these experiments much erodes the plates of zinc, and somewhat
tarnishes those of silver. Whence it would appear, that as by the
repeated explosions of the two electric ethers in the conducting
water, both oxygen and hydrogen are liberated; the oxygen erodes the
zinc plates, and thus increases the Galvanic shock by liberating their
combined electric ethers: and that this erosion is much increased by a
mixture either of acid or of volatile alcali with the water. Further
experiments are wanting on this subject to show whether metallic
bodies emit either or both of the electric ethers at the time of their
solution or erosion in acids or in alcalies.</p>


<p class="p2 center">X. <i>Of the two Magnetic Ethers.</i></p>

<p>1. Magnetism coincides with electricity in so many important points,
that the existence of two magnetic ethers, as well as of two electric
ones, becomes highly probable. We shall suppose, that in a common bar
of iron or steel the two magnetic ethers exist intermixed or in their
neutral state; which for the greater ease of speaking of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_069" name="page_n_069"></a>(p. 069)</span>
them may be called arctic ether and antarctic ether; and in this state
like the two electric fluids they are not cognizable by our senses of
experiments.</p>

<p>When these two magnetic ethers are separated from each other, and the
arctic ether is accumulated on one end of an iron or steel bar, which
is then called the north pole of the magnet, and the antarctic ether
is accumulated on the other end of the bar, and is then termed the
south pole of the magnet; they become capable of attracting other
pieces of iron or steel, and are thus cognizable by experiments.</p>

<p>It seems probable, that it is not the magnetic ether itself which
attracts or repels particles of iron, but that an attractive and
repulsive ether attends the magnetic ethers, as was shown to attend
the electric ones in No. II. 9. of this Note; because magnetism does
not pass through other bodies, as it does not escape from magnetised
steel when in contact with other bodies; just as the electric fluids
do not pass through glass, but the attractive and repellent ethers,
which attend both the magnetic and electric ethers, pass through all
bodies.</p>

<p>2. The prominent articles of analogical coincidence between magnetism
and electricity are first, that when one end of an iron bar possesses
an accumulation of arctic magnetic ether, or northern polarity; the
other end possesses an accumulation of antarctic magnetic ether, or
southern polarity; in the same manner as when vitreous electric ether
is accumulated on one side of a coated glass jar, resinous electric
ether becomes accumulated on the other side of it; as the vitreous and
resinous ethers strongly attract each other, and strongly repel the
ethers of the same denomination, but are prevented from intermixing by
the glass plane between them; so the arctic and antarctic ethers
attract each other, and repel those of similar denomination, but are
prevented from intermixing by the iron or steel being a bad conductor
of them; they will, nevertheless, sooner combine, when the bar is of
soft iron, than when it is of hardened steel; and then they slowly
combine without explosion, that is, without emitting heat and light
like the electric ethers, and therefore resemble a mixture of oxygen
and pure ammonia; which unite silently producing a neutral fluid
without emitting any other fluids previously combined with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_070" name="page_n_070"></a>(p. 070)</span> Secondly, If the north pole of a magnetic bar be approached
near to the eye of a sewing needle, the arctic ether of the magnet
attracts the antarctic ether, which resides in the needle towards the
eye of it, and repels the arctic ether, which resides in the needle
towards the point, precisely in the same manner as occurs in
presenting an electrised, glass tube, or a rubbed stick of sealing wax
to one extremity of two skewers insulated horizontally on wine-glasses
in the experiment ascribed to Mr. Canton, and described in No. IX. 1,
of this Additional Note, and also so exactly resembles the method of
producing a separation and consequent accumulation of the two electric
ethers by pressing a cushion on glass or on sealing wax, described in
No. 4 of this Note, that their analogy is evidently apparent.</p>

<p>Thirdly, When much accumulated electricity is approached to one end of
a long glass tube by a charged prime conductor, there will exist many
divisions of the vitreous and resinous electricity alternately; as the
vitreous ether attracts the resinous ether from a certain distance on
the surface of the glass tube, and repels the vitreous ether; but, as
this surface is a bad conductor, these reciprocal attractions and
repulsions do not extend very far along it, but cease and recur in
various parts of it. Exactly similar to this, when a magnetic bar is
approximated to the end of a common bar of iron or steel, as described
in Mr. Cavallo's valuable Treatise on Magnetism; the arctic ether of
the north pole of the magnetic bar attracts the antarctic ether of the
bar of common iron towards the end in contact, and repels the arctic
ether; but, as iron and steel are as bad conductors of magnetism, as
glass is of electricity, this accumulation of arctic ether extends but
a little way, and then there exists an accumulation of antarctic
ether; and thus reciprocally in three or four divisions of the bar,
which now becomes magnetised, as the glass tube became electrised.</p>

<p>Another striking feature, which shows the sisterhood of electricity
and magnetism, consists in the origin of both of them from the earth,
or common mass of matter. The eduction of electricity from the earth
is shown by an insulated cushion soon ceasing to supply either the
vitreous or resinous ether to the whirling globe of glass or of
sulphur; the eduction of magnetism from the earth appears from the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_071" name="page_n_071"></a>(p. 071)</span> following experiment: if a bar of iron be set upright on the
earth in this part of the world, it becomes in a short time
magnetical; the lower end possessing northern polarity, or arctic
ether, and the higher end in consequence possessing southern polarity
or antarctic ether; which may be well explained, if we suppose with
Mr. Cavallo, that the earth itself is one great magnet, with its
southern polarity or antarctic ether at the northern end of its axis;
and, in consequence, that it attracts the arctic ether of the iron bar
into that end of it which touches the earth, and repels the antarctic
ether of the iron bar to the other end of it, exactly the same as when
the southern pole of an artificial magnet is brought into contact with
one end of a sewing needle.</p>

<p>3. The magnetic and electric ethers agree in the characters above
mentioned, and perhaps in many others, but differ in the following
ones. The electric ethers pass readily through metallic, aqueous, and
carbonic bodies, but do not permeate vitreous or resinous ones; though
on the surfaces of these they are capable of adhering, and of being
accumulated by the approach or contact of other bodies; while the
magnetic ethers will not permeate any bodies, and are capable of being
accumulated only on iron and steel by the approach or contact of
natural or artificial magnets, or of the earth; at the same time the
attractive and repulsive powers both of the magnetic and electric
ethers will act through all bodies, like those of gravitation and
heat.</p>

<p>Secondly, The two electric ethers rush into combination, when they can
approach each other, after having been separated and condensed, and
produce a violent explosion emitting the heat and light, which were
previously combined with them; whereas the two magnetic ethers slowly
combine, after having been separated and accumulated on the opposite
ends of a soft iron bar, and without emitting heat and light produce a
neutral mixture, which, like the electric combination, ceases to be
cognizable by our senses or experiments.</p>

<p>Thirdly, The wonderful property of the magnetic ethers, when
separately accumulated on the ends of a needle, endeavouring to
approach the two opposite poles of the earth; nothing similar to which
has been observed in the electric ethers.</p>

<p>From these strict analogies between electricity and magnetism,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_072" name="page_n_072"></a>(p. 072)</span> we may conclude that the latter consists of two ethers as
well as the former; and that they both, when separated by art or
nature, combine by chemical affinity when they approach, the one
exploding, and then consisting of a residuum after having emitted heat
and light; and the other producing simply a neutralised fluid by their
union.</p>


<p class="p2 center">XI. <i>Conclusion.</i></p>

<p>1. When two fluids are diffused together without undergoing any change
of their chemical properties, they are said simply to be mixed, and
not combined; as milk and water when poured together, or as oxygen and
azote in the common atmosphere. So when salt or sugar is diffused in
water, it is termed solution, and not combination; as no change of
their chemical properties succeeds.</p>

<p>But when an acid is mixed with a pure alcali a combination is
produced, and the mixture is said to become neutral, as it does not
possess the chemical properties which either of the two ingredients
possessed in their separate state, and is therefore similar to neither
of them. But when a carbonated alcali, as mild salt of tartar, is
mixed with a mineral acid, they presently combine as above, but now
the carbonic acid flies forcibly away in the form of gas; this,
therefore, may be termed a kind of explosion, but cannot properly be
so called, as the ethereal fluids of heat and light are not
principally emitted, but an aerial one or gas; which may probably
acquire a small quantity of heat from the combining matters.</p>

<p>But when strong acid of nitre is poured upon charcoal in fine powder,
or upon oil of cloves, a violent explosion ensues, and the ethereal
matters of heat and light are emitted in great abundance, and are
dissipated; while in the former instance the oxygen of the nitrous
acid unites with the carbone forming carbonic acid gas, and the azote
escapes in its gaseous form; which may be termed a residuum after the
explosion, and may be confined in a proper apparatus, which the heat
and light cannot; for the former, if its production be great and
sudden, bursts the vessels, or otherwise it passes slowly through
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_073" name="page_n_073"></a>(p. 073)</span> them; and the latter passes through transparent bodies, and
combines with opake ones.</p>

<p>But where ethers only are concerned in an explosion, as the two
electric ones, which are previously difficult to confine in vessels;
the repulsive ethers of heat and light are given out; and what remains
is a combination of the two electric ethers; which in this state are
attracted by all bodies, and form atmospheres round them.</p>

<p>These combined electric atmospheres must possess less heat and light
after their explosion; which they seem afterwards to acquire at the
time they are again separated from each other, probably from the
combined heat and combined light of the cushion and glass, or of the
cushion and resin; by the contact of which they are separated; and not
from the diffused heat of them; but no experiments have yet been made
to ascertain this fact, this combination of the vitreous and resinous
ethers may be esteemed the residuum after their explosion.</p>

<p>2. Hence the essence of explosion consists in two bodies, which are
previously united with heat and light, so strongly attracting each
other, as to set at liberty those two repulsive ethers; but it
happens, that these explosive materials cannot generally be brought
into each other's vicinity in a state of sufficient density; unless
they are also previously combined with some other material beside the
light and heat above spoken of: as in the nitrous acid, the oxygen is
previously combined with azote; and is thus in a condensed state,
before it is brought into the contact or vicinity of the carbone;
there are however bodies which will slowly explode; or give out heat
and light, without being previously combined with other bodies; as
phosphorus in the common atmosphere, some dead fish in a certain
degree of putridity, and some living insects probably by their
respiration in transparent lungs, which is a kind of combustion.</p>

<p>But the two electric ethers are condensed by being brought into
vicinity with each other with a nonconductor between them; and thus
explode, violently as soon as they communicate, either by rupturing
the interposed nonconductor, or by a metallic communication. This
curious method of a previous condensation of the two exploding
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_074" name="page_n_074"></a>(p. 074)</span> matters, without either of them being combined with any
other material except with the ethers of heat and light,
distinguishes, this ethereal explosion from that of most other bodies;
and seems to have been the cause, which prevented the ingenious Dr.
Franklin, and others since his time, from ascribing the powerful
effects of the electric battery, and of lightning in bursting trees,
inflaming combustible materials, and fusing metals, to chemical
explosion; which it resembles in every other circumstance, but in the
manner of the previous condensation of the materials, so as violently
to attract each other, and suddenly set at liberty the heat and light,
with which one or both of them were combined.</p>

<p>3. This combination of vitreous and resinous electric ethers is again
destroyed or weakened by the attractions of other bodies; as they
separate intirely, or exist in different proportions, forming
atmospheres round conducting and nonconducting bodies; and in this
they resemble other combinations of matters; as oxygen and azote, when
united in the production of nitrous acid, are again separated by
carbone; which attracts the oxygen more powerfully, than that attracts
the azote, with which it is combined.</p>

<p>This mode of again separating the combined electric ethers by pressing
them, as they surround bodies in different proportions, into each
other's atmospheres, as by the glass and cushion, has not been
observed respecting the decomposition of other bodies; when their
minute particles are brought so near together as to decompose each
other; which has thence probably contributed to prevent this
decomposition of the two combined electric ethers from being ascribed
to chemical laws; but, as far as we know, the attractive and repulsive
atmospheres round the minute particles of bodies in chemical
operations may act in a similar manner; as the attractive and
repulsive atmospheres, which accompany the electric ethers surrounding
the larger masses of matter, and that hence both the electric and the
chemical explosions are subject to the same laws, and also the
decomposition again of those particles, which were combined in the act
of explosion.</p>

<p>4. It is probable that this theory of electric and magnetic
attractions <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_075" name="page_n_075"></a>(p. 075)</span> and repulsions, which so visibly exist in
atmospheres round larger masses of matter, may be applied to explain
the invisible attractions and repulsions of the minute particles of
bodies in chemical combinations and decompositions, and also to give a
clear idea of the attractions of the great masses of matter, which
form the gravitations of the universe.</p>

<p>We are so accustomed to see bodies attract each other, when they are
in absolute contact, as dew drops or particles of quicksilver forming
themselves into spheres, as water rising in capillary tubes, the
solution of salts and sugar in water, and the cohesion with which all
hard bodies are held together, that we are not surprised at the
attractions of bodies in contact with each other, but ascribe them to
a law affecting all matter. In similar manner when two bodies in
apparent contact repel each other, as oil thrown on water; or when
heat converts ice into water and water into steam; or when one hard
body in motion pushes another hard body out of its place; we feel no
surprise, as these events so perpetually occur to us, but ascribe them
as well as the attractions of bodies in contact with each other, to a
general law of nature.</p>

<p>But when distant bodies appear to attract or repel each other, as we
believe that nothing can act where it does not exist, we are struck
with astonishment; which is owing to our not seeing the intermediate
ethers, the existence of which is ascertained by the electric and
magnetic facts above related.</p>

<p>From the facts and observations above mentioned electricity and
magnetism consist each of them of two ethers, as the vitreous and
resinous electric ethers, and the arctic and antarctic magnetic
ethers. But as neither of the electric ethers will pass through glass
or resin; and as neither of the magnetic ethers will pass through any
bodies except iron; and yet the attractive and repulsive powers
accompanying all these ethers permeate bodies of all kinds; it
follows, that ethers more subtile than either the electric or magnetic
ones attend those ethers forming atmospheres round them; as those
electric and magnetic ethers themselves form atmospheres round other
bodies.</p>

<p>This secondary atmosphere of the electric one appears to consist
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_076" name="page_n_076"></a>(p. 076)</span> of two ethers, like the electric one which it surrounds: but
these ethers are probably more subtile as they permeate all bodies;
and when they unite by the reciprocal approach of the bodies, which
they surround, they do not appear to emit heat and light, as the
primary electric atmospheres do; and therefore they are simpler
fluids, as they are not previously combined with heat and light. The
secondary magnetic atmospheres are also probably more subtile or
simple than the primary ones.</p>

<p>Hence we may suppose, that not only all the larger insulated masses of
matter, but all the minute particles also, which constitute those
masses, are surrounded by two ethereal fluids; which like the electric
and magnetic ones attract each other forcibly, and as forcibly repel
those of the same denomination; and at the same time strongly adhere
to the bodies, which they surround. Secondly that these ethers are of
the finer kind, like those secondary ones, which surround the primary
electric and magnetic ethers; and that therefore they do not explode
giving out heat and light when they unite, but simply combine, and
become neutral; and lastly, that they surround different bodies in
different proportions, as the vitreous and resinous electric ethers
were shown to surround silver and zinc and many other metals in
different proportions in No. IX. of this note.</p>

<p>5. For the greater ease of conversing on this subject, we shall call
these two ethers, with which all bodies are surrounded, the masculine
and the feminine ethers; and suppose them to possess the properties
above mentioned. We should here however previously observe, that in
chemical processes it is necessary, that the bodies, which are to
combine or unite with each other, should be in a fluid state, and the
particles in contact with each other; thus when salt is dissolving in
water, the particles of salt unite with those of the water, which
touch them; these particles of water become saturated, and thence
attract some of the saline particles with less force; which are
therefore attracted from them by those behind; and the first particles
of water are again saturated from the solid salt; or in some similar
processes the saturated combinations may subside or evaporate, as in
the union of the two electric ethers, or in the explosion of
gunpowder, and thus those in their vicinity may approach each other.
This necessity <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_077" name="page_n_077"></a>(p. 077)</span> of a liquid form for the purpose of
combination appears in the lighting of gunpowder, as well as in all
other combustion, the spark of fire applied dissolves the sulphur, and
liquifies the combined heat; and by these means a fluidity succeeds,
and the consequent attractions and repulsions, which form the
explosion.</p>

<p>The whole mixed mass of matter, of which the earth is composed, we
suppose to be surrounded and penetrated by the two ethers, but with a
greater proportion of the masculine ether than of the feminine. When a
stone is elevated above the surface of the earth, we suppose it also
to be surrounded with an atmosphere of the two ethers, but with a
greater proportion of the feminine than of the masculine, and that
these ethers adhere strongly by cohesion both to the earth and to the
stone elevated above it. Now the greater quantity of the masculine
ether of the earth becomes in contact with the greater quantity of the
feminine ether of the stone above it; which it powerfully attracts,
and at the same time repels the less quantity of the masculine ether
of the stone. The reciprocal attractions of these two fluids, if not
restrained by counter attractions, bring them together as in chemical
combination, and thus they bring together the solid bodies, which they
reciprocally adhere to; if they be not immovable; which solid bodies,
when brought into contact, cohere by their own reciprocal attractions,
and hence the mysterious affair of distant attraction or gravitation
becomes intelligible, and consonant to the chemical combinations of
fluids.</p>

<p>To further elucidate these various attractions, if the patient reader
be not already tired, he will please to attend to the following
experiment: let a bit of sponge suspended on a silk line be moistened
with a solution of pure alcali, and another similar piece of sponge be
moistened with a weak acid, and suspended near the former; electrize
one of them with vitreous ether, and the other with resinous ether; as
they hang with a thin plate of glass between them: now as these two
electric ethers appear to attract each other without intermixing; as
neither of them can pass through glass; they must be themselves
surrounded with secondary ethers, which pass through the glass, and
attract each other, as they become in contact; as these secondary
ethers adhere to the primary vitreous and resinous ethers, these
primary ones are drawn <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_078" name="page_n_078"></a>(p. 078)</span> by them into each other's vicinity by
the attraction of cohesion, and become condensed on each side of the
glass plane; and then when the glass plane is withdrawn, the two
electric ethers being now in contact rush violently together, and draw
along with them the pieces of moistened sponge, to which they adhere;
and finally the acid and alcaline liquids being now brought into
contact combine by their chemical affinity.</p>

<p>The repulsions of distant bodies are also explicable by this idea of
their being surrounded with two ethers, which we have termed masculine
and feminine for the ease of conversing about them; and have compared
them to vitreous and resinous electricity, and to arctic and antarctic
magnetism. As when two particles of matter, or two larger masses of
it, are surrounded both with their masculine ethers, these ethers
repel each other or refuse to intermix; and in consequence the bodies
to which they adhere, recede from each other; as two cork-balls
suspended near each other, and electrised both with vitreous or both
with resinous ether, repel each other; or as the extremities of two
needles magnetised both with arctic, or both with antarctic ether,
repel each other; or as oil and water surrounded both with their
masculine, or both with their feminine ethers, repel each other
without touching; so light is believed to be reflected from a mirror
without touching its surface, and to be bent towards the edge of a
knife, or refracted by its approach from a rarer medium into a denser
one, by the repulsive ether of the mirror, and the attractive ones of
the knife-edge, and of the denser medium. Thus a polished tea-cup
slips on the polished saucer probably without their actual contact
with each other, till a few drops of water are interposed between them
by capillary attraction, and prevent its sliding by their tenacity.
And so, lastly, one hard body in motion pushes another hard body out
of its place by their repulsive ethers without being in contact; as
appears from their not adhering to each other, which all bodies in
real contact are believed to do. Whence also may be inferred the
reason why bodies have been supposed to repel at one distance and
attract at another, because they attract when their particles are in
contact with each other, and either attract or repel <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_079" name="page_n_079"></a>(p. 079)</span> when at
a distance by the intervention of their attractive or repulsive
ethers.</p>

<p>Thus have I endeavoured to take one step further back into the mystery
of the gravitation and repulsion of bodies, which appeared to be
distant from each other, as of the sun and planets, as I before
endeavoured to take one step further back into the mysteries of
generation in my account of the production of the buds of vegetables
in Phytologia. With what success these have been attended I now leave
to the judgment of philosophical readers, from which I can make no
appeal.</p>

ANALYSIS OF TASTE.</h4>

<p class="poem20">
  Fond Fancy's eye recalls the form divine,<br>
  And Taste sits smiling upon Beauty's shrine.<br>
<span class="left50"><span class="smcap">Canto III.</span> l. 221.</span></p>

<p class="p2">The word Taste in its extensive application may express the pleasures
received by any of our senses, when excited into action by the
stimulus of external objects; as when odours stimulate the nostrils,
or flavours the palate; or when smoothness, or softness, are perceived
by the touch, or warmth by its adapted organ of sense. The word Taste
is also used to signify the pleasurable trains of ideas suggested by
language, as in the compositions of poetry and oratory. But the
pleasures, consequent to the exertions of our sense of vision only,
are designed here to be treated of, with occasional references to
those of the ear, when they elucidate each other.</p>

<p>When any of our organs of sense are excited into their due quantity of
action, a pleasurable sensation succeeds, as shown in Zoonomia, Vol.
I. Sect. IV. These are simply the pleasures attending perception, and
not those which are termed the pleasures of Taste; which consist of
additional pleasures arising from the peculiar forms or colours of
objects, or of their peculiar combinations or successions, or from
other agreeable trains of ideas previously associated with them.</p>

<p>There are four sources of pleasure attendant on the excitation of the
nerves of vision by light and colours, besides that simply of
perception above mentioned; the first is derived from a degree of
novelty of the forms, colours, numbers, combinations, or successions,
and visible objects. The second is derived from a degree of repetition
of their forms, colours, numbers, combinations, or successions. Where
these two circumstances exist united in certain quantities, and
compose the principal part of a landscape, it is termed picturesque by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_081" name="page_n_081"></a>(p. 081)</span> modern writers. The third source of pleasure from the
perception of the visible world may be termed the melody of colours,
which will be shown to coincide with melody of sounds: this
circumstance may also accompany the picturesque, and will add to the
pleasure it affords. The fourth source of pleasure from the perception
of visible objects is derived from the previous association of other
pleasurable trains of ideas with certain forms, colours, combinations,
or successions of them. Whence the beautiful, sublime, romantic,
melancholic, and other emotions, which have not acquired names to
express them. We may add, that all these four sources of pleasure from
perceptions are equally applicable to those of sounds as of sights.</p>


<p class="p2 center">I. <i>Novelty or infrequency of visible objects.</i></p>

<p>The first circumstance, which suggests an additional pleasure in the
contemplation of visible objects, besides that of simple perception,
arises from their novelty or infrequency; that is from the unusual
combinations or successions of their forms or colours. From this
source is derived the perpetual cheerfulness of youth, and the want of
it is liable to add a gloom to the countenance of age. It is this
which produces variety in landscape compared with the common course of
nature, an intricacy which incites investigation, and a curiosity
which leads to explore the works of nature. Those who travel into
foreign regions instigated by curiosity, or who examine and unfold the
intricacies of sciences at home, are led by novelty; which not only
supplies ornament to beauty or to grandeur, but adds agreeable
surprise to the point of the epigram, and to the double meaning of the
pun, and is courted alike by poets and philosophers.</p>

<p>It should be here premised, that the word Novelty, as used in these
pages, admits of degrees or quantities, some objects, or the ideas
excited by them, possessing more or less novelty, as they are more or
less unusual. Which the reader will please to attend to, as we have
used the word Infrequency of objects, or of the ideas excited by them,
to express the degrees or quantities of their novelty.</p>

<p>The source, from which is derived the pleasure of novelty, is a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_082" name="page_n_082"></a>(p. 082)</span> metaphysical inquiry of great curiosity, and will on that
account excuse my here introducing it. In our waking hours whenever an
idea occurs, which is incongruous to our former experience, we
instantly dissever the train of imagination by the power of volition;
and compare the incongruous idea with our previous knowledge of
nature, and reject it. This operation of the mind has not yet acquired
a specific name, though it is exerted every minute of our waking
hours, unless it may be termed <span class="smcap">Intuitive Analogy</span>. It is an act of
reasoning of which we are unconscious except by its effects in
preserving the congruity of our ideas; Zoonomia, Vol. I. Sect. XVII.
5. 7.</p>

<p>In our sleep as the power of volition is suspended, and consequently
that of reason, when any incongruous ideas occur in the trains of
imagination, which compose our dreams; we cannot compare them with our
previous knowledge of nature and reject them; whence arises the
perpetual inconsistency of our sleeping trains of ideas; and whence in
our dreams we never feel the sentiment of novelty; however different
the ideas, which present themselves, may be from the usual course of
nature.</p>

<p>But in our waking hours, whenever any object occurs which does not
accord with the usual course of nature, we immediately and
unconsciously exert our voluntary power, and examine it by intuitive
analogy, comparing it with our previous knowledge of nature. This
exertion of our volition excites many other ideas, and is attended
with pleasurable sensation; which constitutes the sentiment of
novelty. But when the object of novelty stimulates us so forcibly as
suddenly to disunite our passing trains of ideas, as if a pistol be
unexpectedly discharged, the emotion of surprise is experienced; which
by exciting violent irritation and violent sensation, employs for a
time the whole sensorial energy, and thus dissevers the passing trains
of ideas; before the power of volition has time to compare them with
the usual phenomena of nature; but as the painful emotion of fear is
then generally added to that of surprise, as every one experiences,
who hears a noise in the dark, which he cannot immediately account
for; this great degree of novelty, when it produces much surprise,
generally ceases to be pleasurable, and does not then belong to
objects of taste.</p>

<p>In its less degree surprise is generally agreeable, as it simply
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_083" name="page_n_083"></a>(p. 083)</span> expresses the sentiment occasioned by the novelty of our
ideas; as in common language we say, we are agreeably surprised at the
unexpected meeting with a friend, which not only expresses the
sentiment of novelty, but also the pleasure from other agreeable ideas
associated with the object of it.</p>

<p>It must appear from hence, that different persons must be affected
more or less agreeably by different degrees or quantities of novelty
in the objects of taste; according to their previous knowledge of
nature, or their previous habits or opportunities of attending to the
fine arts. Thus before its nativity the fetus experiences the
perceptions of heat and cold, of hardness and softness, of motion and
rest, with those perhaps of hunger and repletion, sleeping and waking,
pain and pleasure; and perhaps some other perceptions, which may at
this early time of its existence have occasioned perpetual trains of
ideas. On its arrival into the world the perceptions of light and
sound must by their novelty at first dissever its usual trains of
ideas and occasion great surprise; which after a few repetitions will
cease to be disagreeable, and only excite the emotion from novelty,
which has not acquired a separate name, but is in reality a less
degree of surprise; and by further experience the sentiment of
novelty, or any degree of surprise, will cease to be excited by the
sounds or sights, which at first excited perhaps a painful quantity of
surprise.</p>

<p>It should here be observed, that as the pleasure of novelty is
produced by the exertion of our voluntary power in comparing uncommon
objects with those which are more usually exhibited; this sentiment of
novelty is less perceived by those who do not readily use the faculty
of volition, or who have little previous knowledge of nature, as by
very ignorant or very stupid people, or by brute animals; and that
therefore to be affected with this circumstance of the objects of
Taste requires some previous knowledge of-such kinds of objects, and
some degree of mental exertion.</p>

<p>Hence when a greater variety of objects than usual is presented to the
eye, or when some intricacy of forms, colours, or reciprocal locality
more than usual accompanies them, it is termed novelty if it only
excites the exertion of intuitive comparison with the usual order of
nature, and affects us with pleasurable sensation; but is termed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_084" name="page_n_084"></a>(p. 084)</span> surprise, if it suddenly dissevers our accustomed habits of
motion, and is then more generally attended with disagreeable
sensation. To this circumstance attending objects of taste is to be
referred what is termed wild and irregular in landscapes, in
contradistinction to the repetition of parts or uniformity spoken of
below. We may add, that novelty of notes and tones in music, or of
their combinations or successions, are equally agreeable to the ear,
as the novelty of forms and colours, and of their combinations or
successions are to the eye; but that the greater quantity or degree of
novelty, the sentiment of which is generally termed Surprise, is more
frequently excited by unusual or unexpected sounds; which are liable
to alarm us with fear, as well as surprise us with novelty.</p>


<p class="p2 center">II. <i>Repetition of visible objects.</i></p>

<p>The repeated excitement of the same or similar ideas with certain
intervals of time, or distances of space between them, is attended
with agreeable sensations, besides that simply of perception; and,
though it appears to be diametrically opposite to the pleasure arising
from the novelty of objects above treated of, enters into the
compositions of all the agreeable arts.</p>

<p>The pleasure arising from the repetition of similar ideas with certain
intervals of time or distances of space between them is a subject of
great metaphysical curiosity, as well as the source of the pleasure
derived from novelty, which will I hope excuse its introduction in
this place.</p>

<p>The repetitions of motions may be at first produced either by
volition, or by sensation, or by irritation, but they soon become
easier to perform than any other kinds of action, because they soon
become associated together; and thus their frequency of repetition, if
as much sensorial power be produced during every reiteration, as is
expended, adds to the facility of their production.</p>

<p>If a stimulus be repeated at uniform intervals of time, the action,
whether of our muscles or organs of sense, is produced with still
greater facility or energy; because the sensorial power of
association, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_085" name="page_n_085"></a>(p. 085)</span> mentioned above, is combined with the sensorial
power of irritation; that is in common language, the acquired habit
assists the power of the stimulus.</p>

<p>This not only obtains in the annual, lunar, and diurnal catenations of
animal motions, as explained in Zoonomia, Sect. XXXVI. which are thus
performed with great facility and energy; but in every less circle of
actions or ideas, as in the burden of a song, or the reiterations of a
dance. To the facility and distinctness, with which we hear sounds at
repeated intervals, we owe the pleasure, which we receive from musical
time, and from poetic time, as described in Botanic Garden, V. II.
Interlude III. And to this the pleasure we receive from the rhimes and
alliterations of modern versification; the source of which without
this key would be difficult to discover.</p>

<p>There is no variety of notes referable to the gamut in the beating of
a drum, yet if it be performed in musical time, it is agreeable to our
ears; and therefore this pleasurable sensation must be owing to the
repetition of the divisions of the sounds at certain intervals of
time, or musical bars. Whether these times or bars are distinguished
by a pause, or by an emphasis, or accent, certain it is, that this
distinction is perpetually repeated; otherwise the ear could not
determine instantly, whether the successions of sound were in common
or in triple time.</p>

<p>But besides these little circles of musical time, there are the
greater returning periods, and the still more distinct choruses;
which, like the rhimes at the end of verses, owe their beauty to
repetition; that is, to the facility and distinctness with which we
perceive sounds, which we expect to perceive or have perceived before;
or in the language of this work, to the greater ease and energy with
which our organ is excited by the combined sensorial powers of
association and irritation, than by the latter singly.</p>

<p>This kind of pleasure arising from repetition, that is from the
facility and distinctness with which we perceive and understand
repeated sensations, enters into all the agreeable arts; and when it
is carried to excess is termed formality. The art of dancing like that
of music depends for a great part of the pleasure, it affords, on
repetition; architecture, especially the Grecian, consists of one part
being a repetition <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_086" name="page_n_086"></a>(p. 086)</span> of another, and hence the beauty of the
pyramidal outline in landscape-painting; where one side of the picture
may be said in some measure to balance the other. So universally does
repetition contribute to our pleasure in the fine arts, that beauty
itself has been defined by some writers to consist in a due
combination of uniformity and variety: Zoonomia, Vol. I. Sect. XXII.
2. 1.</p>

<p>Where these repetitions of form, and reiterations of colour, are
produced in a picture or a natural landscape, in an agreeable
quantity, it is termed simplicity, or unity of character; where the
repetition principally is seen in the disposition or locality of the
divisions, it is called symmetry, proportion, or grouping the separate
parts; where this repetition is most conspicuous in the forms of
visible objects, it is called regularity or uniformity; and where it
affects the colouring principally, the artists call it breadth of
colour.</p>

<p>There is nevertheless, an excess of the repetition of the same or
similar ideas, which ceases to please, and must therefore be excluded
from compositions of Taste in painted landscapes, or in ornamented
gardens; which is then called formality, monotony, or insipidity. Why
the excitation of ideas should give additional pleasure by the
facility and distinctness of their production for a certain time, and
then cease to give additional pleasure; and gradually to give less
pleasure than that, which attends simple exertion of them; is another
curious metaphysical problem, and deserves investigation.</p>

<p>In our waking hours a perpetual voluntary exertion, of which we are
unconscious, attends all our new trains of ideas, whether those of
imagination or of perception; which by comparing them with our former
experience preserves the consistency of the former, by rejecting such
as are incongruous; and adds to the credibility of the latter, by
their analogy to objects of our previous knowledge: and this exertion
is attended with pleasurable sensation. After very frequent repetition
these trains of ideas do not excite the exertion of this intuitive
analogy, and in consequence are not attended with additional pleasure
to that simply of perception; and by continued repetition they at
length lose even the pleasure simply of perception, and thence finally
cease to be excited; whence one cause of the torpor of old age, and of
death, as spoken of in Additional Note, No. VII. 3. of this work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_087" name="page_n_087"></a>(p. 087)</span> When there exists in any landscape a certain number and
diversity of forms and colours, or of their combinations or
successions, so as to produce a degree of novelty; and that with a
certain repetition, or arrangement of parts, so as to render them
gradually comprehensible or easily compared with the usual course of
nature; if this agreeable combination of visible objects be on a
moderate scale, in respect to magnitude, and form the principal part
of the landscape, it is termed <span class="smcap">Picturesque</span> by modern artists; and when
such a combination of forms and colours contains many easy flowing
curves and smooth surfaces, the delightful sentiment of <span class="smcap">Beauty</span> becomes
added to the pleasure of the Picturesque.</p>

<p>If the above agreeable combination of novelty and repetition exists on
a larger scale with more projecting rocks, and deeper dells, and
perhaps with a somewhat greater proportion of novelty than repetition,
the landscape assumes the name of <span class="smcap">Romantic</span>; and if some of these forms
or combinations are much above the usual magnitude of similar objects,
the more interesting sentiment of <span class="smcap">Sublimity</span> becomes mixed with the
pleasure of the romantic.</p>


<p class="p2 center">III. <i>Melody of Colours.</i></p>

<p>A third source of pleasure arising from the inspection of visible
objects, besides that of simple perception, arises from what may be
termed melody of colours, as certain colours are more agreeable, when
they succeed each other; or when they are disposed in each other's
vicinity, so as successively to affect the organ of vision.</p>

<p>In a paper on the colours seen in the eye after looking for some time
on luminous objects, published by Dr. Darwin of Shrewsbury in the
Philos. Trans. Vol. 76, it is evidently shown, that we see certain
colours not only with greater ease and distinctness, but with relief
and pleasure, after having for some time inspected other certain
colours; as green after red, or red after green; orange after blue, or
blue after orange; yellow after violet, or violet after yellow; this,
he shows, arises from the ocular spectrum of the colour last viewed
coinciding with the irritation of the colour now under contemplation.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_088" name="page_n_088"></a>(p. 088)</span> Thus if you make a dot with ink in the centre of a circle of
red silk the size of a letter-wafer, and place it on a sheet of white
paper, and look on it for a minute without moving your eyes; and then
gently turn them on the white paper in its vicinity, or gently close
them, and hold one hand an inch or two before them, to prevent too
much light from passing through the eyelids, a circular spot of pale
green will be seen on the white paper, or in the closed eye; which is
called the ocular spectrum of the red silk, and is formed as Dr.
Darwin shows by the pandiculation or stretching of the fine fibrils,
which constitute the extremities of the optic nerve, in a direction
contrary to that, in which they have been excited by previously
looking at a luminous object, till they become fatigued; like the
yawning or stretching of the larger muscles after acting long in one
direction.</p>

<p>If at this time the eye, fatigued by looking long at the centre of the
red silk, be turned on paper previously coloured with pale green; the
circular spot or ocular spectrum will appear of a much darker green;
as now the irritation from the pale green paper coincides with the
pale green spectrum remaining in the eye, and thus excites those
fibres of the retina into stronger action; on this account some
colours are seen more distinctly, and consequently more agreeably
after others; or when placed in the vicinity of others; thus if
orange-coloured letters are painted on a blue ground, they may be read
at as great distance as black on white, perhaps at a greater.</p>

<p>The colours, which are thus more distinct when seen in succession are
called opposite colours by Sir Isaac Newton in his optics, Book I.
Part 2, and may be easily discovered by any one, by the method above
described; that is by laying a coloured circle of paper or silk on a
sheet of white paper, and inspecting it some time with steady eyes,
and then either gently closing them, or removing them on another part
of the white paper, and the ocular spectrum or opposite colour becomes
visible in the eye.</p>

<p>Sir Isaac Newton has observed, that the breadths of the seven primary
colours in the sun's image refracted by a prism, are proportioned to
the seven musical notes of the gamut; or to the intervals of the eight
sounds contained in an octave.</p>

<p>From this curious coincidence, it has been proposed to produce a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_089" name="page_n_089"></a>(p. 089)</span> luminous music, consisting of successions or combinations of
colours, analogous to a tune in respect to the proportions above
mentioned. This might be performed by a strong light, made by means of
Mr. Argand's lamps, passing through coloured glasses, and falling on a
defined part of the wall, with moveable blinds before them, which
might communicate with the keys of a harpsichord, and thus produce at
the same time visible and audible music in unison with each other.</p>

<p>Now as the pleasure we receive from the sensation of melodious notes,
independent of musical time, and of the previous associations of
agreeable ideas with them, must arise from our hearing some
proportions of sounds after others more easily, distinctly, or
agreeably; and as there is a coincidence between the proportions of
the primary colours, and the primary sounds, if they may be so called;
the same laws must probably govern the sensations of both. In this
circumstance therefore consists the sisterhood of Music and Painting;
and hence they claim a right to borrow metaphors from each other:
musicians to speak of the brilliancy of sounds, and the light and
shade of a concerto; and painters of the harmony of colours, and the
tone of a picture.</p>

<p>This source of pleasure received from the melodious succession of
colours or of sounds must not be confounded with the pleasure received
from the repetition of them explained above, though the repetition, or
division of musical notes into bars, so as to produce common or triple
time, contributes much to the pleasure of music; but in viewing a
fixed landscape nothing like musical time exists; and the pleasure
received therefore from certain successions of colours must depend
only on the more easy or distinct action of the retina in perceiving
some colours after others, or in their vicinity, like the facility or
even pleasure with which we act with contrary muscles in yawning or
stretching after having been fatigued with a long previous exertion in
the contrary direction.</p>

<p>Hence where colours are required to be distinct, those which are
opposite to each other, should be brought into succession or vicinity;
as red and green, orange and blue, yellow and violet; but where
colours are required to intermix imperceptibly, or slide into each
other, these should not be chosen; as they might by contrast appear
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_090" name="page_n_090"></a>(p. 090)</span> too glaring or tawdry. These gradations and contrasts of
colours have been practically employed both by the painters of
landscape, and by the planters of ornamental gardens; though the
theory of this part of the pleasure derived from visible objects was
not explained before the publication of the paper on ocular spectra
above mentioned; which is reprinted at the end of the first part of
Zoonomia, and has thrown great light on the actions of the nerves of
sense in consequence of the stimulus of external bodies.</p>


<p class="p2 center">IV. <i>Association of agreeable sentiments with visible objects.</i></p>

<p>Besides the pleasure experienced simply by the perception of visible
objects, it has been already shown, that there is an additional
pleasure arising from the inspection of those, which possess novelty,
or some degree of it; a second additional pleasure from those, which
possess in some degree a repetition of their parts; and a third from
those, which possess a succession of particular colours, which either
contrast or slide into each other, and which we have termed melody of
colours.</p>

<p>We now step forward to the fourth source of the pleasures arising from
the contemplation of visible objects besides that simply of
perception, which consists in our previous association of some
agreeable sentiment with certain forms or combinations of them. These
four kinds of pleasure singly or in combination constitute what is
generally understood by the word Taste in respect to the visible
world; and by parity of reasoning it is probable, that the pleasurable
ideas received by the other senses, or which are associated with
language, may be traced to similar sources.</p>

<p>It has been shown by Bishop Berkeley in his ingenious essay on vision,
that the eye only acquaints us with the perception of light and
colours; and that our idea of the solidity of the bodies, which
reflect them, is learnt by the organ of touch: he therefore calls our
vision the language of touch, observing that certain gradations of the
shades of colour, by our previous experience of having examined
similar bodies by our hands or lips, suggest our ideas of solidity,
and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_091" name="page_n_091"></a>(p. 091)</span> of the forms of solid bodies; as when we view a tree, it
would otherwise appear to us a flat green surface, but by association
of ideas we know it to be a cylindrical stem with round branches. This
association of the ideas acquired by the sense of touch with those of
vision, we do not allude to in the following observations, but to the
agreeable trains or tribes of ideas and sentiments connected with
certain kinds of visible objects.</p>


<p class="p2 center">V. <i>Sentiment of Beauty.</i></p>

<p>Of these catenations of sentiments with visible objects, the first is
the sentiment of Beauty or Loveliness; which is suggested by
easy-flowing curvatures of surface, with smoothness; as is so well
illustrated in Mr. Burke's Essay on the Sublime and Beautiful, and in
Mr. Hogarth's analysis of Beauty; a new edition of which is much
wanted separate from his other works.</p>

<p>The sentiment of Beauty appears to be attached from our cradles to the
easy curvatures of lines, and smooth surfaces of visible objects, and
to have been derived from the form of the female bosom; as spoken of
in Zoonomia, Vol. I. Section XVI. on Instinct.</p>

<p>Sentimental love, as distinguished from the animal passion of that
name, with which it is frequently accompanied, consists in the desire
or sensation of beholding, embracing, and saluting, a beautiful
object.</p>

<p>The characteristic of beauty therefore is that it is the object of
love; and though many other objects are in common language called
beautiful, yet they are only called so metaphorically, and ought to be
termed agreeable. A Grecian temple may give us the pleasurable idea of
sublimity; a Gothic temple may give us the pleasurable idea of
variety; and a modern house the pleasurable idea of utility; music and
poetry may inspire our love by association of ideas; but none of
these, except metaphorically, can be termed beautiful; as we have no
wish to embrace or salute them.</p>

<p>Our perception of beauty consists in our recognition by the sense of
vision of those objects, first which have before inspired our love by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_092" name="page_n_092"></a>(p. 092)</span> the pleasure, which they have afforded to many of our
senses: as to our sense of warmth, of touch, of smell, of taste,
hunger and thirst; and secondly, which bear any analogy of form to
such objects.</p>

<p>When the babe, soon after it is born into this cold world, is applied
to its mother's bosom, its sense of perceiving warmth is first
agreeably affected; next its sense of smell is delighted with the
odour of her milk; then its taste is gratified by the flavour of it,
afterwards the appetites of hunger and of thirst afford pleasure by
the possession of their objects, and by the subsequent digestion of
the aliment; and lastly, the sense of touch is delighted by the
softness and smoothness of the milky fountain, the source of such
variety of happiness.</p>

THE THEORY AND STRUCTURE OF LANGUAGE</h4>

<p class="poem20">
  Next to each thought associate sound accords,<br>
  And forms the dulcet symphony of words.<br>
<span class="left50"><span class="smcap">Canto III.</span> l. 365.</span></p>

<p class="p2">Ideas consist of synchronous motions or configurations of the
extremities of the organs of sense; these when repeated by sensation,
volition, or association, are either simple or complex, as they were
first excited by irritation; or have afterwards some parts abstracted
from them, or some parts added to them. Language consists of words,
which are the names or symbols of ideas. Words are therefore properly
all of them nouns or names of things.</p>

<p>Little had been done in the investigation of the theory of language
from the time of Aristotle to the present æra, till Mr. Horne Tooke,
the ingenious and learned author of the Diversions of Purley,
explained those undeclined words of all languages, which had puzzled
the grammarians, and evinced from their etymology, that they were
abbreviations of other modes of expression. Mr. Tooke observes, that
the first aim of language was to communicate our thoughts, and the
second to do it with dispatch; and hence he divides words into those,
which were necessary to express our thoughts, and those which are
abbreviations of the former; which he ingeniously styles the wings of
Hermes.</p>

<p>For the greater dispatch of conversation many words suggest more than
one idea; I shall therefore arrange them according to the number and
kinds of ideas, which they suggest; and am induced to do this, as a
new distribution of the objects of any science may advance the
knowledge of it by developing another analogy of its constituent
parts. And in thus endeavouring to analyze the theory of language I
mean to speak primarily of the English, and occasionally to add what
may occur concerning the structure of the Greek and Latin.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_094" name="page_n_094"></a>(p. 094)</span> I. <i>Conjunctions and Prepositions.</i></p>

<p>The first class of words consists of those, which suggest but one
idea, and suffer no change of termination; which have been termed by
grammarians <span class="smcap">Conjunctions</span> and <span class="smcap">Prepositions</span>; the former of which connect
sentences, and the latter words. Both which have been ingeniously
explained by Mr. Horne Tooke from their etymology to be abbreviations
of other modes of expression.</p>

<p>1. Thus the conjunction <i>if</i> and <i>an</i>, are shown by Mr. Tooke to be
derived from the imperative mood of the verbs to give and to grant;
but both of these conjunctions by long use appear to have become the
name of a more abstracted idea, than the words give or grant suggest,
as they do not now express any ideas of person, or of number, or of
time; all which are generally attendant upon the meaning of a verb;
and perhaps all the words of this class are the names of ideas much
abstracted, which has caused the difficulty of explaining them.</p>

<p>2. The number of Prepositions is very great in the English language,
as they are used before the cases of nouns, and the infinitive mood of
verbs, instead of the numerous changes of termination of the nouns and
verbs of the Greek and Latin; which gives greater simplicity to our
language, and greater facility of acquiring it.</p>

<p>The prepositions, as well as the preceding conjunctions, have been
well explained by Mr. Horne Tooke; who has developed the etymology of
many of them. As the greatest number of the ideas, we receive from
external objects, are complex ones, the names of these constitute a
great part of language, as the proper names of persons and places;
which are complex terms. Now as these complex terms do not always
exactly suggest the quantity of combined ideas we mean to express,
some of the prepositions are prefixed to them to add or to deduct
something, or to limit their general meaning; as a house with a party
wall, or a house without a roof. These words are also derived by Mr.
Tooke, as abbreviations of the imperative moods of verbs; but which
appear now to suggest ideas further abstracted than those generally
suggested by verbs, and are all of them properly nouns, or names of
ideas.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_095" name="page_n_095"></a>(p. 095)</span> II. <i>Nouns Substantive.</i></p>

<p>The second class of words consists of those, which in their simplest
state suggest but one idea, as the word man; but which by two changes
of termination in our language suggest one secondary idea of number,
as the word men; or another secondary idea of the genitive case, as
man's mind, or the mind of man. These words by other changes of
termination in the Greek and Latin languages suggest many other
secondary ideas, as of gender, as well as of number, and of all the
other cases described in their grammars; which in English are
expressed by prepositions.</p>

<p>This class of words includes the <span class="smcap">Nouns Substantive</span>, or names of
things, of common grammars, and may be conveniently divided into three
kinds. 1. Those which suggest the ideas of things believed to possess
hardness and figure, as a house or a horse. 2. Those which suggest the
ideas of things, which are not supposed to possess hardness and
figure, except metaphorically, as virtue, wisdom; which have therefore
been termed abstracted ideas. 3. Those which have been called by
metaphysical writers reflex ideas, and mean those of the operations of
the mind, as sensation, volition, association.</p>

<p>Another convenient division of these nouns substantive or names of
things may be first into general terms, or the names of classes of
ideas, as man, quadruped, bird, fish, animal. 2. Into the names of
complex ideas, as this house, that dog. 3. Into the names of simple
ideas, as whiteness, sweetness.</p>

<p>A third convenient division of the names of things may be into the
names of intire things, whether of real or imaginary being; these are
the nouns substantive of grammars. 2. Into the names of the qualities
or properties of the former; these are the nouns adjective of
grammars. 3. The names of more abstracted ideas as the conjunctions
and prepositions of grammarians.</p>

<p>These nouns substantive, or names of intire things, suggest but one
idea in their simplest form, as in the nominative case singular of
grammars. As the word a stag is the name of a single complex idea; but
the word stags by a change of termination adds to this a secondary
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_096" name="page_n_096"></a>(p. 096)</span> idea of number; and the word stag's, with a comma before the
final s, suggests, in English, another secondary idea of something
appertaining to the stag, as a stag's horn; which is, however, in our
language, as frequently expressed by the preposition <i>of</i>, as the horn
of a stag.</p>

<p>In the Greek and Latin languages an idea of gender is joined with the
names of intire things, as well as of number; but in the English
language the nouns, which express inanimate objects, have no genders
except metaphorically; and even the sexes of many animals have names
so totally different from each other, that they rather give an idea of
the individual creature than of the sex, as bull and cow, horse and
mare, boar and sow, dog and bitch. This constitutes another
circumstance, which renders our language more simple, and more easy to
acquire; and at the same time contributes to the poetic excellence of
it; as by adding a masculine or feminine pronoun, as he, or she, other
nouns substantive are so readily personified.</p>

<p>In the Latin language there are five cases besides the nominative, or
original word, and in the Greek four. Whence the original noun
substantive by change of its termination suggests a secondary idea
either corresponding with the genitive, dative, accusative, vocative,
or ablative cases, besides the secondary ideas of number and gender
above mentioned. The ideas suggested by these changes of termination,
which are termed cases, are explained in the grammars of these
languages, and are expressed in ours by prepositions, which are called
the signs of those cases.</p>

<p>Thus the word Domini, of the Lord, suggests beside the primary idea a
secondary one of something appertaining to it, as templum domini, the
temple of the Lord, or the Lord's temple; which in English is either
effected by an addition of the letter s, with a comma before it, or by
the preposition <i>of</i>. This genitive case is said to be expressed in
the Hebrew language simply by the locality of the words in succession
to each other; which must so far add to the conciseness of that
language.</p>

<p>Thus the word Domino, in the dative case, to the Lord, suggests
besides the primary idea a secondary one of something being added to
the primary one; which is effected in English by the preposition <i>to</i>.</p>

<p>The accusative case, or Dominum, besides the primary idea implies
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_097" name="page_n_097"></a>(p. 097)</span> something having acted upon the object of that primary idea;
as felis edit murem, the cat eats the mouse. This is thus effected in
the Greek and Latin by a change of termination of the noun acted upon,
but is managed in a more concise way in our language by its situation
in the sentence, as it follows the verb. Thus if the mouse in the
above sentence was placed before the verb, and the cat after it, in
English the sense would be inverted, but not so in Latin; this
necessity of generally placing the accusative case after the verb is
inconvenient in poetry; though it adds to the conciseness and
simplicity of our language, as it saves the intervention of a
preposition, or of a change of termination.</p>

<p>The vocative case of the Latin language, or Domine, besides the
primary idea suggests a secondary one of appeal, or address; which in
our language is either marked by its situation in the sentence, or by
the preposition O preceding it. Whence this interjection O conveys the
idea of appeal joined to the subsequent noun, and is therefore
properly another noun, or name of an idea, preceding the principal one
like other prepositions.</p>

<p>The ablative case in the Latin language, as Domino, suggests a
secondary idea of something being deducted from or by the primary one.
Which is perhaps more distinctly expressed by one of those
prepositions in our language; which, as it suggests somewhat
concerning the adjoined noun, is properly another noun, or name of an
idea, preceding the principal one.</p>

<p>When to these variations of the termination of nouns in the singular
number are added those equally numerous of the plural, and the great
variety of these terminations correspondent to the three genders, it
is evident that the prepositions of our own and other modern languages
instead of the changes of termination add to the simplicity of these
languages, and to the facility of acquiring them.</p>

<p>Hence in the Latin language, besides the original or primary idea
suggested by each noun substantive, or name of an entire thing, there
attends an additional idea of number, another of gender, and another
suggested by each change of termination, which constitutes the cases;
so that in this language four ideas are suggested at the same time by
one word; as the primary idea, its gender, number, and case; the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_098" name="page_n_098"></a>(p. 098)</span> latter of which has also four or five varieties. These nouns
therefore may properly be termed the abbreviation of sentences; as the
conjunctions and prepositions are termed by Mr. Tooke the abbreviation
of words; and if the latter are called the wings affixed to the feet
of Hermes, the former may be called the wings affixed to his cap.</p>


<p class="p2 center">III. <i>Adjectives, Articles, Participles, Adverbs.</i></p>

<p>1. The third class of words consists of those, which in their simplest
form suggest two ideas; one of them is an abstracted idea of the
quality of an object, but not of the object itself; and the other is
an abstracted idea of its appertaining to some other noun called a
substantive, or a name of an entire thing.</p>

<p>These words are termed <span class="smcap">Adjectives</span>, are undeclined in our language in
respect to cases, number, or gender; but by three changes of
termination they suggest the secondary ideas of greater, greatest, and
of less; as the word sweet changes into sweeter, sweetest, and
sweetish; which may be termed three degrees of comparison besides the
positive meaning of the word; which terminations of <i>er</i> and <i>est</i> are
seldom added to words of more than two syllables; as those degrees are
then most frequently denoted by the prepositions more and most.</p>

<p>Adjectives seem originally to have been derived from nouns
substantive, of which they express a quality, as a musky rose, a
beautiful lady, a stormy day. Some of them are formed from the
correspondent substantive by adding the syllable <i>ly</i>, or <i>like</i>, as a
lovely child, a warlike countenance; and in our language it is
frequently only necessary to put a hyphen between two nouns
substantive for the purpose of converting the former one into an
adjective, as an eagle-eye, a Mayday. And many of our adjectives are
substantives unchanged, and only known by their situation in a
sentence, as a German, or a German gentleman. Adjectives therefore are
names of qualities, or parts of things; as substantives are the names
of entire things.</p>

<p>In the Latin and Greek languages these adjectives possess a great
variety of terminations; which suggest occasionally the ideas of
number, gender, and the various cases, agreeing in all these with the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_099" name="page_n_099"></a>(p. 099)</span> substantive, to which they belong; besides the two original
or primary ideas of quality, and of their appertaining to some other
word, which must be adjoined to make them sense. Insomuch that some of
these adjectives, when declined through all their cases, and genders,
and numbers, in their positive, comparative, and superlative degrees,
enumerate fifty or sixty terminations. All which to one, who wishes to
learn these languages, are so many new words, and add much to the
difficulty of acquiring them.</p>

<p>Though the English adjectives are undeclined, having neither case,
gender, nor number; and with this simplicity of form possess a degree
of comparison by the additional termination of ish, more than the
generality of Latin or Greek adjectives, yet are they less adapted to
poetic measure, as they must accompany their corresponding
substantives; from which they are perpetually separated in Greek and
Latin poetry.</p>

<p>2. There is a second kind of adjectives, which abound in our language,
and in the Greek, but not in the Latin, which are called <span class="smcap">Articles</span> by
the writers of grammar, as the letter <i>a</i>, and the word <i>the</i>. These,
like the adjectives above described, suggest two primary ideas, and
suffer no change of termination in our language, and therefore suggest
no secondary ideas.</p>

<p>Mr. Locke observes, that languages consist principally of general
terms; as it would have been impossible to give a name to every
individual object, so as to communicate an idea of it to others; it
would be like reciting the name of every individual soldier of an
army, instead of using the general term, army. Now the use of the
article <i>a</i>, and <i>the</i> in English, and <i>o</i> in Greek, converts general
terms into particular ones; this idea of particularity as a quality,
or property of a noun, is one of the primary ideas suggested by these
articles; and the other is, that of its appertaining to some
particular noun substantive, without which it is not intelligible. In
both these respects these articles correspond with adjectives; to
which may be added, that our article <i>a</i> may be expressed by the
adjective one or any; and that the Greek article <i>o</i> is declined like
other adjectives.</p>

<p>The perpetual use of the article, besides its converting general terms
into particular ones, contributes much to the force and beauty
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_100" name="page_n_100"></a>(p. 100)</span> of our language from another circumstance, that abstracted
ideas become so readily personified simply by the omission of it;
which perhaps renders the English language better adapted to poetry
than any other ancient or modern: the following prosopop&oelig;ia from
Shakspeare is thus beautiful.</p>

<p class="poem20">
  She let Concealment like a worm i' th' bud<br>
  Feed on her damask cheek.</p>

<p>And the following line, translated from Juvenal by Dr. Johnson, is
much superior to the original, owing to the easy personification of
Worth and Poverty, and to the consequent conciseness of it.</p>

<p class="poem20">
  Difficile emergunt, quorum virtutibus obstat<br>
  Res angusta domi.<br>
  Slow rises Worth by Poverty depress'd.</p>

<p>3. A third class of adjectives includes what are termed <span class="smcap">Participles</span>,
which are allied to the infinitive moods of verbs, and are formed in
our language by the addition only of the syllable <i>ing</i> or <i>ed</i>; and
are of two kinds, active and passive, as loving, loved, from the verb
to love. The verbs suggest an idea of the noun, or thing spoken of;
and also of its manner of existence, whether at rest, in action, or in
being acted upon; as I lie still, or I whip, or I am whipped; and,
lastly, another idea of the time of resting, acting, or suffering; but
these adjectives called participles, suggest only two primary ideas,
one of the noun, or thing spoken of, and another of the mode of
existence, but not a third idea of time; and in this respect
participles differ from the verbs, from which they originate, or which
originated from them, except in their infinitive moods.</p>

<p>Nor do they resemble adjectives only in their suggesting but two
primary ideas; but in the Latin and Greek languages they are declined
through all the cases, genders, and numbers, like other adjectives;
and change their terminations in the degrees of comparison.</p>

<p>In our language the participle passive, joined to the verb <i>to be</i>,
for the purpose of adding to it the idea of time, forms the whole of
the passive voice; and is frequently used in a similar manner in the
Latin <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_101" name="page_n_101"></a>(p. 101)</span> language, as I am loved is expressed either by amor,
or amatus sum. The construction of the whole passive voice from the
verb <i>to be</i> and the participles passive of other verbs, contributes
much to the simplicity of our language, and the ease of acquiring it;
but renders it less concise than perhaps it might have been by some
simple variations of termination, as in the active voice of it.</p>

<p>4. A fourth kind of adjective is called by the grammarians an <span class="smcap">Adverb</span>;
which has generally been formed from the first kind of adjectives, as
these were frequently formed from correspondent substantives; or it
has been formed from the third kind of adjectives, called participles;
and this is effected in both cases by the addition, of the syllable
<i>ly</i>, as wisely, charmingly.</p>

<p>This kind of adjective suggests two primary ideas, like the
adjectives, and participles, from which they are derived; but differ
from them in this curious circumstance, that the other adjectives
relate to substantives, and are declined like them in the Latin and
Greek languages, as a lovely boy, a warlike countenance; but these
relate to verbs, and are therefore undeclined, as to act boldly, to
suffer patiently.</p>


<p class="p2 center">IV. <i>Verbs.</i></p>

<p>The fourth class of words consists of those which are termed <span class="smcap">Verbs</span>,
and which in their simplest state suggest three ideas; first an idea
of the noun, or name of the thing spoken of, as a whip. 2. An idea of
its mode of existence, whether at rest, or in action, or in being
acted upon. 3. An idea of the time of its existence. Thus "the beadle
whipped the beggar," in prolix language might be expressed, the beadle
with a whip struck in time past the beggar. Which three ideas are
suggested by the one word whipped.</p>

<p>Verbs are therefore nouns, or names of intire ideas, with the
additional ideas of their mode of existence and of time; but the
participles suggest only the noun, and the mode of existence, without
any idea of time; as whipping, or whipped. The infinitive moods of
verbs correspond in their signification with the participles; as they
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_102" name="page_n_102"></a>(p. 102)</span> also suggest only the noun, or name of the thing spoken of,
and an idea of its mode of existence, excluding the idea of time;
which is expressed by all the other moods and tenses; whence it
appears, that the infinitive mood, as well as the participle, is not
truly a part of the verb; but as the participle resembles the
adjective in its construction; so the infinitive mood may be said to
resemble the substantive, and it is often used as a nominative case to
another verb.</p>

<p>Thus in the words "a charming lady with a smiling countenance," the
participle acts as an adjective; and in the words "to talk well
commands attention," the infinitive mood acts as the nominative case
of a noun substantive; and their respective significations are also
very similar, as whipping, or to whip, mean the existence of a person
acting with a whip.</p>

<p>In the Latin language the verb in its simplest form, except the
infinitive mood, and the participle, both which we mean to exclude
from complete verbs, suggests four primary ideas, as amo, suggests the
pronoun I, the noun love, its existence in its active state, and the
present time; which verbs in the Greek and Latin undergo an uncounted
variation of termination, suggesting so many different ideas in
addition to the four primary ones.</p>

<p>We do not mean to assert, that all verbs are literally derived from
nouns in any language; because all languages have in process of time
undergone such great variation; many nouns having become obsolete or
have perished, and new verbs have been imported from foreign
languages, or transplanted from ancient ones; but that this has
originally been the construction of all verbs, as well as those to
whip and to love above mentioned, and innumerable others.</p>

<p>Thus there may appear some difficulty in analyzing from what noun
substantive were formed the verbs to stand or to lie; because we have
not properly the name of the abstract ideas from which these verbs
arose, except we use the same word for the participle and the noun
substantive, as standing, lying. But the verbs, to sit, and to walk,
are less difficult to trace to their origin; as we have names for the
nouns substantive, a seat, and a walk.</p>

<p>But there is another verb of great consequence in all languages, which
would appear, in its simplest form in our language to suggest
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_103" name="page_n_103"></a>(p. 103)</span> but two primary ideas, as the verb <i>to be</i>, but that it
suggests three primary ideas like other verbs maybe understood, if we
use the synonymous term to exist instead of to be. Thus "I exist"
suggests first the abstract idea of existence, not including the mode
of existence, whether at rest, or in action, or in suffering; secondly
it adds to that abstracted idea of existence its real state, or actual
resting, acting, or suffering, existence; and thirdly the idea of the
present time: thus the infinitive mood <i>to be</i>, and the participle,
<i>being</i>, suggest both the abstract idea of existence, and the actual
state of it, but not the time.</p>

<p>The verb <i>to be</i> is also used irregularly to designate the parts of
time and actual existence; and is then applied to either the active or
passive participles of other verbs, and called an auxiliary verb;
while the mode of existence, whether at rest, or in action, or being
acted upon, is expressed by the participle, as "I am loving" is nearly
the same as "I love," amo; and "I am loved," amatus sum, is nearly the
same as amor. This mode of application of the verb <i>to be</i> is used in
French as well as in English, and in the passive voice of the Latin,
and perhaps in many other languages; and is by its perpetual use in
conversation rendered irregular in them all, as I am, thou art, he is,
would not seem to belong to the infinitive mood <i>to be</i>, any more than
sum, fui, sunt, fuerunt, appear to belong to esse.</p>

<p>The verb <i>to have</i> affords another instance of irregular application;
the word means in its regular sense to possess, and then suggests
three ideas like the above verb of existence: first the abstracted
idea of the thing spoken of, or possession; secondly, the actual
existence of possession, and lastly the time, as I have or possess.
This verb <i>to have</i> like the verb <i>to be</i> is also used irregularly to
denote parts of past time, and is then joined to the passive
participles alone, as I have eaten; or it is accompanied with the
passive participle of the verb <i>to be</i>, and then with the active
participle of another verb, as I have been eating.</p>

<p>There is another word <i>will</i> used in the same irregular manner to
denote the parts of future time, which is derived from the verb <i>to
will</i>; which in its regular use signifies to exert our volition. There
are other words used to express other circumstances attending upon
verbs, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_104" name="page_n_104"></a>(p. 104)</span> as may, can, shall, all which are probably the
remains of verbs otherwise obsolete. Lastly, when we recollect, that
in the moods and tenses of verbs one word expresses never less than
three ideas in our language, and many more in the Greek and Latin; as
besides those three primary ideas the idea of person, and of number,
are always expressed in the indicative mood, and other ideas suggested
in the other moods, we cannot but admire what excellent abbreviations
of language are thus achieved; and when we observe the wonderful
intricacy and multiplicity of sounds in those languages, especially in
the Greek verbs, which change both the beginning and ending of the
original word through three voices, and three numbers, with uncounted
variations of dialect; we cannot but admire the simplicity of modern
languages compared to these ancient ones; and must finally perceive,
that all language consists simply of nouns, or names of ideas,
disposed in succession or in combination, all of which are expressed
by separate words, or by various terminations of the same word.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><i>Conclusion.</i></p>

<p>The theory of the progressive production of language in the early
times of society, and its gradual improvements in the more civilized
ones, may be readily induced from the preceding pages. In the
commencement of Society the names of the ideas of entire things,
which, it was necessary most frequently to communicate, would first be
invented, as the names of individual persons, or places, fire, water,
this berry, that root; as it was necessary perpetually to announce,
whether one or many of such external things existed, it was soon found
more convenient to add this idea of number by a change of termination
of the word, than by the addition of another word.</p>

<p>As many of these nouns soon became general terms, as bird, beast,
fish, animal; it was next convenient to distinguish them when used for
an individual, from the same word used as a general term; whence the
two articles <i>a</i> and <i>the</i>, in our language, derive their origin.</p>

<p>Next to these names of the ideas of entire things, the words most
perpetually wanted in conversation would probably consist of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_105" name="page_n_105"></a>(p. 105)</span> names of the ideas of the parts or properties of things;
which might be derived from the names of some things, and applied to
others which in these respects resembled them; these are termed
adjectives, as rosy cheek, manly voice, beastly action; and seem at
first to have been formed simply by a change of termination of their
correspondent substantives. The comparative degrees of greater and
less were found so frequently necessary to be suggested, that a change
of termination even in our language for this purpose was produced; and
is as frequently used as an additional word, as wiser or more wise.</p>

<p>The expression of general similitude, as well as partial similitude,
becomes so frequently used in conversation, that another kind of
adjective, called an adverb, was expressed by a change of termination,
or addition of the syllable ly or like; and as adjectives of the
former kind are applied to substantives, and express a partial
similitude, these are applied to verbs and express a general
similitude, as to act heroically, to speak boldly, to think freely.</p>

<p>The perpetual chain of causes and effects, which constitute the
motions, or changing configurations, of the universe, are so
conveniently divided into active and passive, for expressing the
exertions or purposes of common life, that it became particularly
convenient in all languages to substitute changes of termination,
instead of additional nouns, to express, whether the thing spoken of
was in a state of acting or of being acted upon. This change of
termination betokening action or suffering constitutes the participle,
as loving, loved; which, as it expresses a property of bodies, is
classed amongst adjectives in the preceding pages.</p>

<p>Besides the perpetual allusions to the active or passive state of
things, the comparative times of these motions, or changes, were also
perpetually required to be expressed; it was therefore found
convenient in all languages to suggest them by changes of terminations
in preference to doing it by additional nouns. At the same time the
actual or real existence of the thing spoken of was perpetually
required, as well as the times of their existence, and the active or
passive state of that existence. And as no conversation could be
carried on without unceasingly alluding to these circumstances, they
became in all languages suggested by changes of termination; which are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_106" name="page_n_106"></a>(p. 106)</span> termed moods and tenses in grammars, and convert the
participle above mentioned into a verb; as that participle had
originally been formed by adding a termination to a noun, as chaining,
and chained, from chain.</p>

<p>The great variety of changes of termination in all languages consists
therefore of abbreviations used instead of additional words; and adds
much to the conciseness of language, and the quickness with which we
are enabled to communicate our ideas; and may be said to add
unnumbered wings to every limb of the God of Eloquence.</p>

ANALYSIS OF ARTICULATE SOUNDS.</h4>

<p class="poem20">
  The tongue, the lips articulate; the throat<br>
  With soft vibration modulates the note.<br>
<span class="left50"><span class="smcap">Canto III.</span> l. 367.</span></p>

<p class="p2">Having explained in the preceding account of the theory of language
that it consists solely of nouns, or the names of ideas, disposed in
succession or combination; I shall now attempt to investigate the
number of the articulate sounds, which constitute those names of ideas
by their successions and combinations; and to show by what parts of
the organs of speech they are modulated and articulated; whence may be
deduced the precise number of letters or symbols necessary to suggest
those sounds, and form an alphabet, which may spell with accuracy the
words of all languages.</p>


<p class="p2 center">I. <i>Imperfections of the present Alphabet.</i></p>

<p>It is much to be lamented, that the alphabet, which has produced and
preserved almost all the improvements in other arts and sciences,
should have itself received no improvement in modern times; which have
added so much elucidation to almost every branch of knowledge, that
can meliorate the condition of humanity. Thus in our present alphabets
many letters are redundant, others are wanted; some simple articulate
sounds have two letters to suggest them; and in other instances two
articulate sounds are suggested by one letter. Some of these
imperfections in the alphabet of our own language shall be enumerated.</p>


<ul>
<li><span class="min15em"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_108" name="page_n_108"></a>(p. 108)</span> X. Thus the letter x</span> is compounded of ks, or of gz, as
     in the words excellent, example: eksellent, egzample.</li>

<li><span class="min15em">C. is sometimes k,</span> at other times s, as in the word access.</li>

<li><span class="min15em">G. is a single letter in go;</span> and suggests the letters d and the
     French J in pigeon.</li>

<li><span class="min15em">Qu is kw,</span> as quality is kwality.</li>

<li><span class="min15em">NG in the words</span> long and in king is a simple sound like the
     French n, and wants a new character.</li>

<li><span class="min15em">SH is a simple sound,</span> and wants a new character.</li>

<li><span class="min15em">TH is either sibilant</span> as in thigh; or semivocal as in thee; both
     of which are simple sounds, and want two new characters.</li>

<li><span class="min15em">J French exists</span> in our words confu<i>si</i>on, and conclusion, judge,
     pigeon, and wants a character.</li>

<li><span class="min15em">J consonant</span>, in our language, expresses the letters d, and the
     French j conjoined, as in John, Djon.</li>

<li><span class="min15em">CH is either</span> k as in Arch-angel, or is used for a sound
     compounded of Tsh, as in Children, Tshildren.</li>

<li><span class="min15em">GL is dl,</span> as Glove is pronounced by polite people dlove.</li>

<li><span class="min15em">CL is tl,</span> as Cloe is pronounced by polite speakers Tloe.</li>
</ul>

<p>The spelling of our language in respect to the pronunciation is also
wonderfully defective, though perhaps less so than that of the French;
as the words slaughter and laughter are pronounced totally different,
though spelt alike. The word sough, now pronounced suff, was formerly
called sow; whence the iron fused and received into a sough acquired
the name of sowmetal; and that received into less soughs from the
former one obtained the name of pigs of iron or of lead; from the pun
on the word sough, into sow and pigs. Our word jealousies contains all
the vowels, though three of them only were necessary; nevertheless in
the two words abstemiously and facetiously the vowels exist all of
them in their usual order, and are pronounced in their most usual
manner.</p>

<p>Some of the vowels of our language are diphthongs, and consist of two
vocal sounds, or vowels, pronounced in quick succession; these
diphthongs are discovered by prolonging the sound, and observing, if
the ending of it be different from the beginning; thus the vowel i in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_109" name="page_n_109"></a>(p. 109)</span> in our language, as in the word high, if drawn put ends in
the sound of the letter e as used in English; which is expressed by
the letter i in most other languages: and the sound of this vowel i
begins with ah, and consists therefore of ah and ee. Whilst the
diphthong on in our language, as in the word how, begins with ah also
and ends in oo, and the vowel u of our language, as in the word use,
is likewise a diphthong; which begins with e and ends with oo, as eoo.
The French u is also a diphthong compounded of a and oo, as aoo. And
many other defects and redundancies in our alphabet will be seen by
perusing the subsequent structure of a more perfect one.</p>


<p class="p2 center">II. <i>Production of Sounds.</i></p>

<p>By our organ of hearing we perceive the vibrations of the air; which
vibrations are performed in more or in less time, which constitutes
high or low notes in respect to the gammut; but the tone depends on
the kind of instrument which produces them. In speaking of articulate
sounds they may be conveniently divided first into clear continued
sounds, expressed by the letters called vowels; secondly, Into hissing
sounds, expressed by the letters called sibilants; thirdly, Into
semivocal sounds, which consist of a mixture of the two former; and,
lastly, Into interrupted sounds, represented by the letters properly
termed consonants.</p>

<p>The clear continued sounds are produced by the streams of air passing
from the lungs in respiration through the larynx; which is furnished
with many small muscles, which by their action give a proper tension
to the extremity of this tube; and the sounds, I suppose, are produced
by the opening and closing of its aperture; something like the trumpet
stop of an organ, as may be observed by blowing through the wind-pipe
of a dead goose.</p>

<p>These sounds would all be nearly similar except in their being an
octave or two higher or lower; but they are modulated again, or
acquire various tones, in their passage through the mouth; which thus
converts them into eight vowels, as will be explained below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_110" name="page_n_110"></a>(p. 110)</span> The hissing sounds are produced by air forcibly pushed
through certain passages of the mouth without being previously
rendered sonorous by the larynx; and obtain their sibilancy from their
slower vibrations, occasioned by the mucous membrane, which lines
those apertures or passages, being less tense than that of the larynx.
I suppose the stream of air is in both cases frequently interrupted by
the closing of the sides or mouth of the passages or aperture; but
that this is performed much slower in the production of sibilant
sounds, than in the production of clear ones.</p>

<p>The semivocal sounds are produced by the stream of air having received
quick vibrations, or clear sound, in passing through the larynx, or in
the cavity of the mouth; but apart of it, as the outsides of this
sonorous current of air, afterwards receives slower vibrations, or
hissing sound, from some other passages of the lips or mouth, through
which it then flows. Lastly the stops, or consonants, impede the
current of air, whether sonorous or sibilant, for a perceptible time;
and probably produce some change of tone in the act of opening and
closing their apertures.</p>

<p>There are other clear sounds besides those formed by the larynx; some
of them are formed in the mouth, as may be heard previous to the
enunciation of the letters b, and d, and ga; or during the
pronunciation of the semivocal letters, v. z. j. and others in
sounding the liquid letters r and l; these sounds we shall term
orisonance. The other clear sounds are formed in the nostrils, as in
pronouncing the liquid letters m, n, and ng, these we shall term
narisonance.</p>

<p>Thus the clear sounds, except those above mentioned, are formed in the
larynx along with the musical height or lowness of note; but receive
afterward a variation of tone from the various passages of the mouth:
add to these that as the sibilant sounds consist of vibrations slower
than those formed by the larynx, so a whistling through the lips
consists of vibrations quicker than those formed by the larynx.</p>

<p>As all sound consists in the vibrations of the air, it may not be
disagreeable to the reader to attend to the immediate causes of those
vibrations. When any sudden impulse is given to an elastic fluid like
the air, it acquires a progressive motion of the whole, and a
condensation of the constituent particles, which first receive the
impulse; on <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_111" name="page_n_111"></a>(p. 111)</span> this account the currents of the atmosphere in
stormy seasons are never regular, but blow and cease to blow by
intervals; as a part of the moving stream is condensed by the
projectile force; and the succeeding part, being consequently
rarefied, requires some time to recover its density, and to follow the
former part: this elasticity of the air is likewise the cause of
innumerable eddies in it; which are much more frequent than in streams
of water; as when it is impelled against any oblique plane, it results
with its elastic force added to its progressive one.</p>

<p>Hence when a vacuum is formed in the atmosphere, the sides of the
cavity forcibly rush together both by the general pressure of the
superincumbent air, and by the expansion of the elastic particles of
it; and thus produce a vibration of the atmosphere to a considerable
distance: this occurs, whether this vacuity of air be occasioned by
the discharge of cannon, in which the air is displaced by the sudden
evolution of heat, which as suddenly vanishes; or whether the vacuity
be left by a vibrating string, as it returns from each side of the
arc, in which it vibrates; or whether it be left under the lid of the
valve in the trumpet stop of an organ, or of a child's play trumpet,
which continues perpetually to open and close, when air is blown
through it; which is caused by the elasticity of the currents, as it
occasions the pausing gusts of wind mentioned above.</p>

<p>Hence when a quick current of air is suddenly broken by any
intervening body, a vacuum is produced by the momentum of the
proceeding current, between it and the intervening body; as beneath
the valve of the trumpet-stop above mentioned; and a vibration is in
consequence produced; which with the great facility, which elastic
fluids possess of forming eddies, may explain the production of sounds
by blowing through a fissure upon a sharp edge in a common organ-pipe
or child's whistle; which has always appeared difficult to resolve;
for the less vibration an organ-pipe itself possesses, the more
agreeable, I am informed, is the tone; as the tone is produced by the
vibration of the air in the organ pipe, and not by that of the sides
of it; though the latter, when it exists, may alter the tone though,
not the note, like the belly of a harpsichord, or violin.</p>

<p>When a stream of air is blown on the edge of the aperture of an
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_112" name="page_n_112"></a>(p. 112)</span> organ-pipe about two thirds of it are believed to pass on
the outside of this edge, and one third to pass on the inside of it;
but this current of air on the inside forms an eddy, whether the
bottom of the pipe be closed or not; which eddy returns upwards, and
strikes by quick intervals against the original stream of air, as it
falls on the edge of the aperture, and forces outwards this current of
air with quick repetitions, so as to make more than two thirds of it,
and less than two thirds alternately pass on the outside; whence a
part of this stream of air, on each side of the edge of the aperture
is perpetually stopped by that edge; and thus a vacuum and vibration
in consequence, are reciprocally produced on each side of the edge of
the aperture.</p>

<p>The quickness or slowness of these vibrations constitute the higher
and lower notes of music, but they all of them are propagated to
distant places in the same time; as the low notes of a distant ring of
bells are heard in equal times with the higher ones: hence in speaking
at a distance from the auditors, the clear sounds produced in the
larynx by the quick vibrations of its aperture, which form the vowels;
the tremulous sounds of the L. R. M. N. NG. which are owing to
vibrations of certain apertures of the mouth and nose, and are so
slow, that the intervals between them are perceived; the sibilant
sounds, which I suppose are occasioned by the air not rushing into a
complete vacuum, whence the vibrations produced are defective in
velocity; and lastly the very high notes made by the quickest
vibrations of the lips in whistling; are all heard in due succession
without confusion; as the progressive motions of all sounds I believe
travel with equal velocity, notwithstanding the greater or less
quickness of their vibrations.</p>


<p class="p2 center">III. <span class="smcap">Structure of the Alphabet.</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Mute and antesonant Consonants, and nasal Liquids.</i></p>

<ul>
<li><span class="min15em">P. If the lips</span> be pressed close together and some air be
     condensed in the mouth behind them, on opening the lips the mute
     consonant P begins a syllable; if the lips be closed suddenly
     during the passage of a current of air through them, the air
     becomes <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_113" name="page_n_113"></a>(p. 113)</span> condensed in the mouth behind them, and the
     mute consonant P terminates a syllable.</li>

<li><span class="min15em">B. If in</span> the above situation of the lips a sound is previously
     produced in the mouth, which may be termed orisonance, the
     semisonant consonant B is produced, which like the letter P above
     described may begin or terminate a syllable.</li>

<li><span class="min15em">M. In the above</span> situation of the lips, if a sound is produced
     through the nostrils, which sound is termed narisonance, the
     nasal letter M is formed; the sound of which may be lengthened in
     pronunciation like those of the vowels.</li>

<li><span class="min15em">T. If the point</span> of the tongue be applied to the forepart of the
     palate, at the roots of the upper teeth, and some air condensed
     in the mouth behind, on withdrawing the tongue downwards the mute
     consonant T is formed; which may begin or terminate a syllable.</li>

<li><span class="min15em">D. If the tongue</span> be placed as above described, and a sound be
     previously produced in the mouth, the semisonant consonant D is
     formed, which may begin or terminate a syllable.</li>

<li><span class="min15em">N. If in the above</span> situation of the tongue and palate a sound be
     produced through the nostrils, the nasal letter N is formed, the
     sound of which may be elongated like those of the vowels.</li>

<li><span class="min15em">K. If the point</span> of the tongue be retracted, and applied to the
     middle part of the palate; and some air condensed in the mouth
     behind; on withdrawing the tongue downwards the mute consonant K
     is produced, which may begin or terminate a syllable.</li>

<li><span class="min15em">Ga. If in the above</span> situation of the tongue and palate a sound be
     previously produced in the mouth behind, the semisonant consonant
     G is formed, as pronounced in the word go, and may begin or
     terminate a syllable.</li>

<li><span class="min15em">NG. If in the above</span> situation of the tongue and palate a sound be
     produced through the nostrils; the nasal letter ng is produced,
     as in king and throng; which is the french n, the sound of which
     may be elongated like a vowel; and should have an appropriated
     character, as thus <i>v</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Three of these letters, P, T, K, are stops to the stream of vocal air,
and are called mutes by grammarians; three, B, D, Ga, are preceded by
a little orisonance; and three, M, N, NG, possess continued
narisonance, and have been called liquids by grammarians.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_114" name="page_n_114"></a>(p. 114)</span> <i>Sibilants and Sonisibilants.</i></p>

<ul>
<li><span class="min15em">W. Of the Germans;</span> if the lips be appressed together, as
     informing the letter P; and air from the mouth be forced between
     them; the W sibilant is produced, as pronounced by the Germans,
     and by some of the inferiour people of London, and ought to have
     an appropriated character as thus &#653;.</li>

<li><span class="min15em">W. If in the above</span> situation of the lips a sound be produced in
     the mouth, as in the letter B, and the sonorous air be forced
     between them; the sonisibilant letter W is produced; which is the
     common W of our language.</li>

<li><span class="min15em">F. If the lower lip</span> be appressed to the edges of the upper teeth,
     and air from the mouth be forced between them, the sibilant
     letter F is formed.</li>

<li><span class="min15em">V. If in the above</span> situation of the lip and teeth a sound be
     produced in the mouth, and the sonorous air be forced between
     them, the sonisibilant letter V is formed.</li>

<li><span class="min15em">Th. Sibilant.</span> If the point of the tongue be placed between the
     teeth, and air from the mouth be forced between them, the Th
     sibilant is produced, as in thigh, and should have a proper
     character, as &#934;.</li>

<li><span class="min15em">Th. Sonisibilant.</span> If in the above situation of the tongue and
     teeth a sound be produced in the mouth, and the sonorous air be
     forced between them, the sonisibilant Th is formed, as in Thee;
     and should have an appropriated character as &#920;.</li>

<li><span class="min15em">S. If the point</span> of the tongue be appressed to the forepart of the
     palate, as in forming the letter T, and air from the mouth be
     forced between them, the sibilant letter S is produced.</li>

<li><span class="min15em">Z. If in the above</span> situation of the tongue and palate a sound be
     produced in the mouth, as in the letter D, and the sonorous air
     be forced between them, the sonisibilant letter Z is formed.</li>

<li><span class="min15em">SH. If the point</span> of the tongue be retracted and applied to the
     middle part of the palate, as in forming the letter K, and air
     from the mouth be forced between them, the letter Sh is produced,
     which is a simple sound and ought to have a single character,
     thus <i>&#955;</i>.</li>

<li><span class="min15em">J. French.</span> If in the above situation of the tongue and palate a
     sound be produced in the mouth, as in the letter Ga; and the
     <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_115" name="page_n_115"></a>(p. 115)</span> sonorous air be forced between them; the J consonant of
     the French is formed; which is a sonisibilant letter, as in the
     word conclusion, confusion, pigeon; it should be called Je, and
     should have a different character from the vowel i, with which it
     has an analogy, as thus <i>V</i>.</li>

<li><span class="min15em">H. If the back part</span> of the tongue be appressed to the pendulous
     curtain of the palate and uvula; and air from behind be forced
     between them; the sibilant letter H is produced.</li>

<li><span class="min15em">Ch Spanish.</span> If in the above situation of the tongue and palate a
     sound be produced behind; and the sonorous air be forced between
     them; the Ch Spanish is formed; which is a sonisibilant letter,
     the same as the Ch Scotch in the words Bu<i>ch</i>anan and lo<i>ch</i>: it
     is also perhaps the Welsh guttural expressed by their double L as
     in Lloyd, Lluellen; it is a simple sound, and ought to have a
     single character as
<img src="images/297.jpg" width="20" height="16" alt="H on its side." title=""></li>
</ul>

<p>The sibilant and sonisibilant letters may be elongated in
pronunciation like the vowels; the sibilancy is probably occasioned by
the vibrations of the air being slower than those of the lowest
musical notes. I have preferred the word sonisibilants to the word
semivocal sibilants; as the sounds of these sonisibilants are formedlambda Eta &#955;
in different apertures of the mouth, and not in the larynx like the
vowels.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><i>Orisonant Liquids.</i></p>

<ul>
<li><span class="min15em">R. If the point</span> of the tongue be appressed to the forepart of the
     palate, as in forming the letters T, D, N, S, Z, and air be
     pushed between them so as to produce continued sound, the letter
     R is formed.</li>

<li><span class="min15em">L. If the retracted</span> tongue be appressed to the middle of the
     palate, as in forming the letters K, Ga, NG, Sh, J French, and
     air be pushed over its edges so as to produce continued sound,
     the letter L is formed.</li>
</ul>

<p>The nasal letters m, n, and ng, are clear tremulous sounds like R and
L, and have all of them been called liquids by grammarians. Besides
the R and L, above described, there is another orisonant sound
produced by the lips in whistling; which is not used in this <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_116" name="page_n_116"></a>(p. 116)</span>
country as a part of language, and has therefore obtained no
character, but is analogous to the R and L; it is also possible, that
another orisonant letter may be formed by the back part of the tongue
and back part of the palate, as in pronouncing H and Ch, which may
perhaps be the Welch Ll in Lloyd, Lluellin.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><i>Four pairs of Vowels.</i></p>

<p>A pronounced like au, as in the word call. If the aperture, made by
approximating the back part of the tongue to the uvula and pendulous
curtain of the palate, as in forming the sibilant letter H, and the
sonisibilant letter Ch Spanish, be enlarged just so much as to prevent
sibilancy; and a continued sound produced by the larynx be modulated
in passing through it; the letter A is formed, as in ball, wall, which
is sounded like aw in the word awkward; and is the most usual sound of
the letter A in foreign languages; and to distinguish it from the
succeeding A might be called A micron; as the aperture of the fauces,
where it is produced, is less than in the next A.</p>

<p>A pronounced like ah, as in the word hazard. If the aperture of the
fauces above described, between the back part of the tongue and the
back part of the palate, be enlarged as much as convenient, and a
continued sound, produced in the larynx, be modulated in passing
through it; the letter A is formed, as in animal, army, and ought to
have an appropriated character in our language, as thus &#8704;.
As this letter A is formed by a larger aperture than
the former one, it may be called A mega.</p>

<p>A pronounced as in the words cake, ale. If the retracted tongue by
approximation to the middle part of the palate, as in forming the
letters R, Ga, NG, Sh, J French, L, leaves an aperture just so large
as to prevent sibilancy, and sonorous air from the larynx be modulated
in passing through it; the letter A is produced, as pronounced in the
words whale, sale, and ought to have an appropriated character in our
language, as thus
<img src="images/298.jpg" width="15" height="23" alt="handwritten turned e" title="">;
this is expressed by
the letter E in some modern languages, and might be termed E micron;
as it is formed by a less aperture of the mouth than the succeeding E.</p>

<p>E pronounced like the vowel a, when short, as in the words <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_117" name="page_n_117"></a>(p. 117)</span>
emblem, dwelling. If the aperture above described between the
retracted tongue and the middle of the palate be enlarged as much as
convenient, and sonorous air from the larynx be modulated in passing
through it, the letter E is formed, as in the words egg, herring; and
as it is pronounced in most foreign languages, and might be called E
mega to distinguish it from the preceding E.</p>

<p>I pronounced like e in keel. If the point of the tongue by
approximation to the forepart of the palate, as in forming the letters
T, D, N, S, Z, R, leaves an aperture just so large as to prevent
sibilancy, and sonorous air from the larynx be modulated in passing
through it; the vowel I is produced, which is in our language
generally represented by e when long, as in the word keel; and by i
when, short, as in the word it, which is the sound of this letter in
most foreign languages; and may be called E micron to distinguish it
from the succeeding E or Y.</p>

<p>Y, when it begins a word, as in youth. If the aperture above described
between the point of the tongue, and the forepart of the palate be
enlarged as much as convenient, and sonorous air from the larynx be
modulated in passing through it, the letter Y is formed; which, when
it begins a word, has been called Y consonant by some, and by others
has been thought only a quick pronunciation of our e, or the i of
foreign languages; as in the word year, yellow; and may be termed E
mega, as it is formed by a larger aperture than the preceding e or i.</p>

<p>O pronounced like oo, as in the word fool. If the lips by
approximation to each other, as in forming the letters P, B, M, W
sibilant, W sonisibilant, leave an aperture just so wide as to prevent
sibilancy; and sonorous air from the larynx be modulated in passing
through it; the letter O is formed, as in the words cool, school, and
ought to have an appropriated character as thus &#8734;,
and may be termed o micron to distinguish it from
the succeeding o.</p>

<p>O pronounced as in the word cold. If the aperture above described
between the approximated lips be enlarged as much as convenient; and
sonorous air from the larynx be modulated in passing through it, the
letter o is formed, as in sole, coal, which may be termed o mega, as
it is formed in a larger aperture than the preceding one.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_118" name="page_n_118"></a>(p. 118)</span> <i>Conclusion.</i></p>

<p>The alphabet appears from this analysis of it to consist of thirty-one
letters, which spell all European languages.</p>

<p>Three mute consonants, P, T, K.</p>

<p>Three antesonant consonants, B, D, Ga.</p>

<p>Three narisonant liquids, M, N, NG.</p>

<p>Six sibilants, W German, F, Th, S, Sh, H.</p>

<p>Six sonisibilants, W, V, Th, Z, J French, Ch Spanish.</p>

<p>Two orisonant liquids, R, L.</p>

<p>Eight vowels, Aw, ah, a, e, i, y, oo, o.</p>

<p>To these thirty-one characters might perhaps be added one for the
Welsh L, and another for whistling with the lips; and it is possible,
that some savage nations, whose languages are said to abound with
gutturals, may pronounce a mute consonant, as well as an antesonant
one, and perhaps another narisonant letter, by appressing the back
part of the tongue to the back part of the palate, as in pronouncing
the H, and Ch Spanish.</p>

<p>The philosophical reader will perceive that these thirty-one sounds
might be expressed by fewer characters referring to the manner of
their production. As suppose one character was to express the
antesonance of B, D, Ga; another the orisonance of R, L; another the
sibilance of W, S, Sh, H; another the sonisibilance of W, Z, J French,
Ch Spanish; another to express the more open vowels; another the less
open vowels; for which the word micron is here used, and for which the
word mega is here used.</p>

<p>Then the following characters only might be necessary to express them
all; P alone, or with antesonance B; with narisonance M; with
sibilance W German; with sonisibilance W; with vocality, termed micron
OO; with vocality, termed mega O.</p>

<p>T alone, or with the above characters added to it, would in the same
manner suggest D, N, S, Z, EE, Y, and R with a mark for orisonance.</p>

<p>K alone, or with the additional characters, would suggest Ga, NG, Sh,
J French, A, E, and L, with a mark for orisonance.</p>

<p>F alone, or with a mark for sonisibilance, V.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_119" name="page_n_119"></a>(p. 119)</span> Th alone, or with a mark for sonisibilance, Th.</p>

<p>H alone, or with a mark for sonisibilance, Ch Spanish, and with a mark
for less open vocality, aw, with another for more open vocality ah.</p>

<p>Whence it appears that six single characters, for the letters P, T, K,
F, Th, H, with seven additional marks joined to them for antesonance,
narisonance, orisonance, sibilance, sonisibilance, less open vocality,
and more open vocality; being in all but thirteen characters, may
spell all the European languages.</p>

<p>I have found more difficulty in analyzing the vowels than the other
letters; as the apertures, through which they are modulated, do not
close; and it was therefore less easy to ascertain exactly, in what
part of the mouth they were modulated; but recollecting that those
parts of the mouth must be more ready to use for the purpose of
forming the vowels, which were in the habit of being exerted in
forming the other letters; I rolled up some tin foil into cylinders
about the size of my finger; and speaking the vowels separately
through them, found by the impressions made on them, in what part of
the mouth each of the vowels was formed with somewhat greater
accuracy, but not so as perfectly to satisfy myself.</p>

<p>The parts of the mouth appeared to me to be those in which the letters
P, I, K, and H, are produced; as those, where the letters F and Th are
formed, do not suit the production of mute or antesonant consonants;
as the interstices of the teeth would occasion some sibilance; and
these apertures are not adapted to the formation of vowels on the same
account.</p>

<p>The two first vowels aw and ah being modulated in the back part of the
mouth, it is necessary to open wide the lips and other passages of the
mouth in pronouncing them; that those passages may not again alter
their tone; and that more so in pronouncing ah, than aw; as the
aperture of the fauces is opened wider, where it is formed, and from
the greater or less size of these apertures used in forming the vowels
by different persons, the tone of all of them may be somewhat altered
as spoken by different orators.</p>

<p>I have treated with greater confidence on the formation of articulate
sounds, as I many years ago gave considerable attention to this
subject for the purpose of improving shorthand; at that time I
contrived <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_n_120" name="page_n_120"></a>(p. 120)</span> a wooden mouth with lips of soft leather, and with
a valve over the back part of it for nostrils, both which could be
quickly opened or closed by the pressure of the fingers, the vocality
was given by a silk ribbon about an inch long and a quarter of an inch
wide stretched between two bits of smooth wood a little hollowed; so
that when a gentle current of air from bellows was blown on the edge
of the ribbon, it gave an agreeable tone, as it vibrated between the
wooden sides, much like a human voice. This head pronounced the p, b,
m, and the vowel a, with so great nicety as to deceive all who heard
it unseen, when it pronounced the words mama, papa, map, and pam; and
had a most plaintive tone, when the lips were gradually closed. My
other occupations prevented me from proceeding in the further
construction of this machine; which might have required but thirteen
movements, as shown in the above analysis, unless some variety of
musical note was to be added to the vocality produced in the larynx;
all of which movements might communicate with the keys of a
harpsichord or forte piano, and perform the song as well as the
accompaniment; or which if built in a gigantic form, might speak so
loud as to command an army or instruct a crowd.</p>

<p>I conclude this with an agreeable hope, that now war is ceased, the
active and ingenious of all nations will attend again to those
sciences, which better the condition of human nature; and that the
alphabet will undergo a perfect reformation, which may indeed make it
more difficult to trace the etymologies of words, but will much
facilitate the acquisition of modern languages; which as science
improves and becomes more generally diffused, will gradually become
more distinct and accurate than the ancient ones; as metaphors will
cease to be necessary in conversation, and only be used as the
ornaments of poetry.</p>

<i>Cradle of the world</i>, l. 36. The nations, which possess
Europe and a part of Asia and of Africa, appear to have descended from
one family; and to have had their origin near the banks of the
Mediterranean, as probably in Syria, the site of Paradise, according
to the Mosaic history. This seems highly probable from the similarity
of the structure of the languages of these nations, and from their
early possession of similar religions, customs, and arts, as well as
from the most ancient histories extant. The two former of these may be
collected from Lord Monboddo's learned work on the Origin of Language,
and from Mr. Bryant's curious account of Ancient Mythology.</p>

<p>The use of iron tools, of the bow and arrow, of earthen vessels to
boil water in, of wheels for carriages, and the arts of cultivating
wheat, of coagulating milk for cheese, and of spinning vegetable
fibres for clothing, have been known in all European countries, as
long as their histories have existed; besides the similarity of the
texture of their languages, and of many words in them; thus the word
sack is said to mean a bag in all of them, as &#963;&#945;&#954;&#954;&#959;&#957; in
Greek, saccus in Latin, sacco in Italian, sac in French, and sack in
English and German.</p>

<p>Other families of mankind, nevertheless, appear to have arisen in
other parts of the habitable earth, as the language of the Chinese is
said not to resemble those of this part of the world in any respect.
And the inhabitants of the islands of the South-Sea had neither the
use of iron tools nor of the bow, nor of wheels, nor of spinning, nor
had learned to coagulate milk, or to boil water, though the
domestication of fire seems to have been the first great discovery
that distinguished mankind from the bestial inhabitants of the
forest.<a href="#c1_l36"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto1_l76" name="canto1_l76"></a>
<i>Pictur'd walls</i>, l. 76. The application of mankind, in the
early ages of society, to the imitative arts of painting, carving,
statuary, and the casting of figures in metals, seems to have preceded
the discovery of letters; and to have been used as a written language
to convey intelligence to their distant friends, or to transmit to
posterity the history of themselves, or of their discoveries. Hence
the origin of the hieroglyphic figures which crowded the walls of the
temples of antiquity; many of which may be seen in the tablet of Isis
in the works of Montfaucon; and some of them are still used in the
sciences of chemistry and astronomy, as the characters for the metals
and planets, and the figures of animals on the celestial globe.<a href="#c1_l76"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto1_l83" name="canto1_l83"></a>
<i>So erst, when Proteus</i>, l. 83. It seems probable that
Proteus was the name of a hieroglyphic figure representing Time; whose
form was perpetually changing, and who could discover the past events
of the world, and predict the future. Herodotus does not doubt but
that Proteus was an Egyptian king or deity; and Orpheus calls him the
principle of all things, and the most ancient of the gods; and adds,
that he keeps the keys of Nature, <i>Danet's Dict.</i>, all which might
well accord with a figure representing Time.<a href="#c1_l83"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto1_l126" name="canto1_l126"></a>
<i>Trophonius scoop'd</i>, l. 126. Plutarch mentions, that
prophecies of evil events were uttered from the cave of Trophonius;
but the allegorical story, that whoever entered this cavern were never
again seen to smile, seems to have been designed to warn the
contemplative from considering too much the dark side of nature. Thus
an ancient poet is said to have written a poem on the miseries of the
world, and to have thence become so unhappy as to destroy himself.
When we reflect on the perpetual destruction of organic life, we
should also recollect, that it is perpetually renewed in other forms
by the same materials, and thus the sum total of the happiness of the
world continues undiminished; and that a philosopher may thus smile
again on turning his eyes from the coffins of nature to her cradles.<a href="#c1_l126"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto1_l137" name="canto1_l137"></a>
<i>Fam'd Eleusis stole</i>, l. 137. The Eleusinian mysteries
were invented in Egypt, and afterwards transferred into Greece along
with most of the other early arts and religions of Europe. They seem
to have consisted of scenical representations of the philosophy and
religion of those times, which had previously been painted in
hieroglyphic figures to perpetuate them before the discovery of
letters; and are well explained in Dr. Warburton's divine legation of
Moses; who believes with great probability, that Virgil in the sixth
book of the Æneid has described a part of these mysteries in his
account of the Elysian fields.</p>

<p>In the first part of this scenery was represented Death, and the
destruction of all things; as mentioned in the note on the Portland
Vase in the Botanic Garden. Next the marriage of Cupid and Psyche
seems to have shown the reproduction of living nature; and afterwards
the procession of torches, which is said to have constituted a part of
the mysteries, probably signified the return of light, and the
resuscitation of all things.</p>

<p>Lastly, the histories of illustrious persons of the early ages seem to
have been enacted; who were first represented by hieroglyphic figures,
and afterwards became the gods and goddesses of Egypt, Greece, and
Rome. Might not such a dignified pantomime be contrived, even in this
age, as might strike the spectators with awe, and at the same time
explain many philosophical truths by adapted imagery, and thus both
amuse and instruct?<a href="#c1_l137"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto1_l176" name="canto1_l176"></a>
<i>The statued galleries</i>, l. 176. The art of painting has
appeared in the early state of all societies before the invention of
the alphabet. Thus when the Spanish adventurers, under Cortez, invaded
America, intelligence of their debarkation and movements was daily
transmitted to Montezuma, by drawings, which corresponded with the
Egyptian hieroglyphics. The antiquity of statuary appears from the
Memnon and sphinxes of Egypt; that of casting figures in metals from
the golden calf of Aaron; and that of carving in wood from the idols
or household gods, which Rachel stole from her father Laban, and hid
beneath her garments as she sat upon the straw. Gen. c. xxxi. v. 34.<a href="#c1_l176"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto1_l189" name="canto1_l189"></a>
<i>Love led the Sage</i>, l. 189. This description is taken from
the figures on the Barbarini, or Portland Vase, where Eros, or Divine
Love, with his torch precedes the manes through the gates of Death,
and reverting his smiling countenance invites him into the Elysian
fields.<a href="#c1_l189"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto1_l192" name="canto1_l192"></a>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto1_l224" name="canto1_l224"></a>
<i>Young Nature lisps</i>, l. 224. The perpetual production and
increase of the strata of limestone from the shells of aquatic
animals; and of all those incumbent on them from the recrements of
vegetables and of terrestrial animals, are now well understood from
our improved knowledge of geology; and show, that the solid parts of
the globe are gradually enlarging, and consequently that it is young;
as the fluid parts are not yet all converted into solid ones. Add to
this, that some parts of the earth and its inhabitants appear younger
than others; thus the greater height of the mountains of America seems
to show that continent to be less ancient than Europe, Asia, and
Africa; as their summits have been less washed away, and the wild
animals of America, as the tigers and crocodiles, are said to be less
perfect in respect to their size and strength; which would show them
to be still in a state of infancy, or of progressive improvement.
Lastly, the progress of mankind in arts and sciences, which continues
slowly to extend, and to increase, seems to evince the youth of human
society; whilst the unchanging state of the societies of some insects,
as of the bee, wasp, and ant, which is usually ascribed to instinct,
seems to evince the longer existence, and greater maturity of those
societies. The juvenility of the earth shows, that it has had a
beginning or birth, and is a strong natural argument evincing the
existence of a cause of its production, that is of the Deity.<a href="#c1_l224"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto1_l235" name="canto1_l235"></a>
<i>First Heat from chemic</i>, l. 235. The matter of heat is an
ethereal fluid, in which all things are immersed, and which
constitutes the general power of repulsion; as appears in explosions
which are produced by the sudden evolution of combined heat, and by
the expansion of all bodies by the slower diffusion of it in its
uncombined state. Without heat all the matter of the world would be
condensed into a point by the power of attraction; and neither
fluidity nor life could exist. There are also particular powers of
repulsion, as those of magnetism and electricity, and of chemistry,
such as oil and water; which last may be as numerous as the particular
attractions which constitute chemical affinities; and may both of them
exist as atmospheres round the individual particles of matter; see
Botanic Garden, Vol. I. additional note VII. on elementary heat.<a href="#c1_l235"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto1_l239" name="canto1_l239"></a>
<i>Attraction next</i>, l. 239. The power of attraction may be
divided into general attraction, which is called gravity; and into
particular attraction, which is termed chemical affinity. As nothing
can act where it does not exist, the power of gravity must be
conceived as extending from the sun to the planets, occupying that
immense space; and may therefore be considered as an ethereal fluid,
though not cognizable by our senses like heat, light, and electricity.</p>

<p>Particular attraction, or chemical affinity, must likewise occupy the
spaces between the particles of matter which they cause to approach
each other. The power of gravity may therefore be called the general
attractive ether, and the matter of heat may be called the general
repulsive ether; which constitute the two great agents in the changes
of inanimate matter.<a href="#c1_l239"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto1_l245" name="canto1_l245"></a>
<i>And quick Contraction</i>, l. 245. The power of contraction,
which exists in organized bodies, and distinguishes life from
inanimation, appears to consist of an ethereal fluid which resides in
the brain and nerves of living bodies, and is expended in the act of
shortening their fibres. The attractive and repulsive ethers require
only the vicinity of bodies for the exertion of their activity, but
the contractive ether requires at first the contact of a goad or
stimulus, which appears to draw it off from the contracting fibre, and
to excite the sensorial power of irritation. These contractions of
animal fibres are afterwards excited or repeated by the sensorial
powers of sensation, volition, or association, as explained at large
in Zoonomia, Vol. I.</p>

<p>There seems nothing more wonderful in the ether of contraction
producing the shortening of a fibre, than in the ether of attraction
causing two bodies to approach each other. The former indeed seems in
some measure to resemble the latter, as it probably occasions the
minute particles of the fibre to approach into absolute or adhesive
contact, by withdrawing from them their repulsive atmospheres; whereas
the latter seems only to cause particles of matter to approach into
what is popularly called contact, like the particles of fluids; but
which are only in the vicinity of each other, and still retain their
repulsive atmospheres, as may be seen in riding through shallow water
by the number of minute globules of it thrown up by the horses feet,
which roll far on its surface; and by the difficulty with which small
globules of mercury poured on the surface of a quantity of it can be
made to unite with it.<a href="#c1_l245"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto1_l259" name="canto1_l259"></a>
<i>In branching cones</i>, l. 259. The whole branch of an artery
or vein may be considered as a cone, though each distinct division of
it is a cylinder. It is probable that the amount of the areas of all
the small branches from one trunk may equal that of the trunk,
otherwise the velocity of the blood would be greater in some parts
than in others, which probably only exists when a part is compressed
or inflamed.<a href="#c1_l259"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto1_l262" name="canto1_l262"></a>
<i>Absorb the refluent flood</i>, l. 262. The force of the
arterial impulse appears to cease, after having propelled the blood
through the capillary vessels; whence the venous circulation is owing
to the extremities of the veins absorbing the blood, as those of the
lymphatics absorb the fluids. The great force of absorption is well
elucidated by Dr. Hales's experiment on the rise of the sap-juice in a
vine-stump; see Zoonomia, Vol. I. Sect. XXIII.<a href="#c1_l262"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto1_l268" name="canto1_l268"></a>
<i>And from diminish'd oceans</i>, l. 268. The increase of the
solid parts of the globe by the recrements of organic bodies, as
limestone rocks from shells and bones, and the beds of clay, marl,
coals, from decomposed woods, is now well known to those who have
attended to modern geology; and Dr. Halley, and others, have
endeavoured to show, with great probability, that the ocean has
decreased in quantity during the short time which human history has
existed. Whence it appears, that the exertions of vegetable and animal
life convert the fluid parts of the globe into solid ones; which is
probably effected by combining the matter of heat with the other
elements, instead of suffering it to remain simply diffused amongst
them, which is a curious conjecture, and deserves further
investigation.<a href="#c1_l268"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto1_l270" name="canto1_l270"></a>
<i>And young Sensation</i>, l. 270. Both sensation and volition
consist in an affection of the central part of the sensorium, or of
the whole of it; and hence cannot exist till the nerves are united in
the brain. The motions of a limb of any animal cut from the body, are
therefore owing to irritation, not to sensation or to volition. For
the definitions of irritation, sensation, volition, and association,
see additional Note <a href="#notes2">II</a>.<a href="#c1_l270"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto1_l283" name="canto1_l283"></a>
<i>Or Mucor-stems</i>, l. 283. Mucor or mould in its early state
is properly a microscopic vegetable, and is spontaneously produced on
the scum of all decomposing organic matter. The Monas is a moving
speck, the Vibrio an undulating wire, the Proteus perpetually changes
its shape, and the Vorticella has wheels about its mouth, with which
it makes an eddy, and is supposed thus to draw into its throat
invisible animalcules. These names are from Linneus and Muller; see
<a href="#appen_n_1">Appendix to Additional Note I</a>.<a href="#c1_l283"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto1_l295" name="canto1_l295"></a>
<i>Beneath the shoreless waves</i>, l. 295. The earth was
originally covered with water, as appears from some of its highest
mountains, consisting of shells cemented together by a solution of
part of them, as the limestone rocks of the Alps; Ferber's Travels. It
must be therefore concluded, that animal life began beneath the sea.</p>

<p>Nor is this unanalogous to what still occurs, as all quadrupeds and
mankind in their embryon state are aquatic animals; and thus may be
said to resemble gnats and frogs. The fetus in the uterus has an organ
called the placenta, the fine extremities of the vessels of which
permeate the arteries of the uterus, and the blood of the fetus
becomes thus oxygenated from the passing stream of the maternal
arterial blood; exactly as is done by the gills of fish from the
stream of water, which they occasion to pass through them.</p>

<p>But the chicken in the egg possesses a kind of aerial respiration,
since the extremities of its placental vessels terminate on a
membranous bag, which contains air, at the broad end of the egg; and
in this the chick in the egg differs from the fetus in the womb, as
there is in the egg no circulating maternal blood for the insertion of
the extremities of its respiratory vessels, and in this also I suspect
that the eggs of birds differ from the spawn of fish; which latter is
immersed in water, and which has probably the extremities of its
respiratory organ inserted into the soft membrane which covers it, and
is in contact with the water.<a href="#c1_l295"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto1_l315" name="canto1_l315"></a>
<i>Brineless tide</i>, l. 315. As the salt of the sea has been
gradually accumulating, being washed down into it from the recrements
of animal and vegetable bodies, the sea must originally have been as
fresh as river water; and as it is not saturated with salt, must
become annually saline. The sea-water about our island contains at
this time from about one twenty-eighth to one thirtieth part of sea
salt, and about one eightieth of magnesian salt; Brownrigg on Salt.<a href="#c1_l315"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto1_l327" name="canto1_l327"></a>
<i>An insect-myriad moves</i>, l. 327. After islands or
continents were raised above the primeval ocean, great numbers of the
most simple animals would attempt to seek food at the edges or shores
of the new land, and might thence gradually become amphibious; as is
now seen in the frog, who changes from an aquatic animal to an
amphibious one; and in the gnat, which changes from a natant to a
volant state.</p>

<p>At the same time new microscopic animalcules would immediately
commence wherever there was warmth and moisture, and some organic
matter, that might induce putridity. Those situated on dry land, and
immersed in dry air, may gradually acquire new powers to preserve
their existence; and by innumerable successive reproductions for some
thousands, or perhaps millions of ages, may at length have produced
many of the vegetable and animal inhabitants which now people the
earth.</p>

<p>As innumerable shell-fish must have existed a long time beneath the
ocean, before the calcareous mountains were produced and elevated; it
is also probable, that many of the insect tribes, or less complicate
animals, existed long before the quadrupeds or more complicate ones,
which in some measure accords with the theory of Linneus in respect to
the vegetable world; who thinks, that all the plants now extant arose
from the conjunction and reproduction of about sixty different
vegetables, from which he constitutes his natural orders.</p>

<p>As the blood of animals in the air becomes more oxygenated in their
lungs, than that of animals in water by their gills; it becomes of a
more scarlet colour, and from its greater stimulus the sensorium seems
to produce quicker motions and finer sensations; and as water is a
much better vehicle for vibrations or sounds than air, the fish, even
when dying in pain, are mute in the atmosphere, though it is probable
that in the water they may utter sounds to be heard at a considerable
distance. See on this subject, Botanic Garden, Vol. I. Canto IV. l.
176, Note.<a href="#c1_l327"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto1_l335" name="canto1_l335"></a>
<i>So Trapa rooted</i>, l. 335. The lower leaves of this plant
grow under water, and are divided into minute capillary ramifications;
while the upper leaves are broad and round, and have air bladders in
their footstalks to support them above the surface of the water. As
the aerial leaves of vegetables do the office of lungs, by exposing a
large surface of vessels with their contained fluids to the influence
of the air; so these aquatic leaves answer a similar purpose like the
gills of fish, and perhaps gain from water a similar material. As the
material thus necessary to life seems to be more easily acquired from
air than from water, the subaquatic leaves of this plant and of
sisymbrium, oenanthe, ranunculus aquatilis, water crow-foot, and some
others, are cut into fine divisions to increase the surface, whilst
those above water are undivided; see Botanic Garden, Vol. II. Canto
IV. l. 204. Note.</p>

<p>Few of the water plants of this country are used for economical
purposes, but the ranunculus fluviatilis may be worth cultivation; as
on the borders of the river Avon, near Ringwood, the cottagers cut
this plant every morning in boats, almost all the year round, to feed
their cows, which appear in good condition, and give a due quantity of
milk; see a paper from Dr. Pultney in the Transactions of the Linnean
Society, Vol. V.<a href="#c1_l335"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto1_l343" name="canto1_l343"></a>
<i>So still the Tadpole</i>, l. 343. The transformation of the
tadpole from an aquatic animal into an aerial one is abundantly
curious, when first it is hatched from the spawn by the warmth of the
season, it resembles a fish; it afterwards puts forth legs, and
resembles a lizard; and finally losing its tail, and acquiring lungs
instead of gills, becomes an aerial quadruped.</p>

<p>The rana temporaria of Linneus lives in the water in spring, and on
the land in summer, and catches flies. Of the rana paradoxa the larva
or tadpole is as large as the frog, and dwells in Surinam, whence the
mistake of Merian and of Seba, who call it a frog fish. The esculent
frog is green, with three yellow lines from the mouth to the anus; the
back transversely gibbous, the hinder feet palmated; its more frequent
croaking in the evenings is said to foretell rain. Linnei Syst. Nat.

<p>Linneus asserts in his introduction to the class Amphibia, that frogs
are so nearly allied to lizards, lizards to serpents, and serpents to
fish, that the boundaries of these orders can scarcely be
ascertained.<a href="#c1_l343"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

are only seen in the mornings or evenings, when the sun is not much
more than forty-two degrees high. In the more northern latitudes,
where the meridian sun is not more than forty-two degrees high, they
are also visible at noon.<a href="#c1_l363"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<i>Rose young Dione</i>, l. 372. The hieroglyphic figure of
Venus rising from the sea supported on a shell by two tritons, as well
as that of Hercules armed with a club, appear to be remains of the
most remote antiquity. As the former is devoid of grace, and of the
pictorial art of design, as one half of the group exactly resembles
the other; and as that of Hercules is armed with a club, which was the
first weapon.</p>

<p>The Venus seems to have represented the beauty of organic Nature
rising from the sea, and afterwards became simply an emblem of ideal
beauty; while the figure of Adonis was probably designed to represent
the more abstracted idea of life or animation. Some of these
hieroglyphic designs seem to evince the profound investigations in
science of the Egyptian philosophers, and to have outlived all written
language; and still constitute the symbols, by which painters and
poets give form and animation to abstracted ideas, as to those of
strength and beauty in the above instances.<a href="#c1_l372"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto1_l392" name="canto1_l392"></a>
<i>Awakes and stretches</i>, l. 392. During the first six months
of gestation, the embryon probably sleeps, as it seems to have no use
for voluntary power; it then seems to awake, and to stretch its limbs,
and change its posture in some degree, which is termed quickening.<a href="#c1_l392"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto1_l393" name="canto1_l393"></a>
<i>With gills placental</i>, l. 393. The placenta adheres to any
side of the uterus in natural gestation, or of any other cavity in
extra-uterine gestation; the extremities of its arteries and veins
probably permeate the arteries of the mother, and absorb from thence
through their fine coats the oxygen of the mother's blood; hence when
the placenta is withdrawn, the side of the uterus, where it adhered,
bleeds; but not the extremities of its own vessels.<a href="#c1_l393"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

by its frequently moving its eyes, before it can distinguish common
objects.<a href="#c1_l398"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p>This story from Ovid of the production of animals from the mud of the

account of the opinions of the magi or priests of that country;
showing that the simplest animations were spontaneously produced like
chemical combinations, but were distinguished from the latter by their
perpetual improvement by the power of reproduction, first by solitary,
and then by sexual generation; whereas the products of natural
chemistry are only enlarged by accretion, or purified by filtration.<a href="#c1_l417"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<i>How short the span of Life</i>, l. 1. The thinking few in all
ages have complained of the brevity of life, lamenting that mankind
are not allowed time sufficient to cultivate science, or to improve
their intellect. Hippocrates introduces his celebrated aphorisms with
this idea; "Life is short, science long, opportunities of knowledge
rare, experiments fallacious, and reasoning difficult."&mdash;A melancholy
reflection to philosophers!<a href="#c2_l1"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<i>The age-worn fibres</i>, l. 3. Why the same kinds of food,
which enlarge and invigorate the body from infancy to the meridian of
life, and then nourish it for some years unimpaired, should at length
gradually cease to do so, and the debility of age and death supervene,
would be liable to surprise us if we were not in the daily habit of
observing it; and is a circumstance which has not yet been well
understood.</p>

<p>Before mankind introduced civil society, old age did not exist in the
world, nor other lingering diseases; as all living creatures, as soon
as they became too feeble to defend themselves, were slain and eaten
by others, except the young broods, who were defended by their mother;
and hence the animal world existed uniformly in its greatest strength
and perfection; see Additional Note <a href="#notes7">VII</a>.<a href="#c2_l3"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<i>Combines with Heat</i>, l. 39. It was shown in note on line
248 of the first Canto, that much of the aerial and liquid parts of
the terraqueous globe was converted by the powers of life into solid
matter; and that this was effected by the combination of the fluid,
heat, with other elementary bodies by the appetencies and propensities
of the parts of living matter to unite with each other. But when these
appetencies and propensities of the parts of organic matter to unite
with each other cease, the chemical affinities of attraction and the
aptitude to be attracted, and of repulsion and the aptitude to be
repelled, succeed, and reduce much of the solid matters back to the
condition of elements; which seems to be effected by the matter of
heat being again set at liberty, which was combined with other matters
by the powers of life; and thus by its diffusion the solid bodies
return into liquid ones or into gasses, as occurs in the processes of
fermentation, putrefaction, sublimation, and calcination. Whence
solidity appears to be produced in consequence of the diminution of
heat, as the condensation of steam into water, and the consolidation
of water into ice, or by the combination of heat with bodies, as with
the materials of gunpowder before its explosion.<a href="#c2_l39"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto2_l43" name="canto2_l43"></a>
<i>Immortal matter</i>, l. 43. The perpetual mutability of the
forms of matter seems to have struck the philosophers of great
antiquity; the system of transmigration taught by Pythagoras, in which
the souls of men were supposed after death to animate the bodies of a
variety of animals, appears to have arisen from this source. He had
observed the perpetual changes of organic matter from one creature to
another, and concluded, that the vivifying spirit must attend it.<a href="#c2_l43"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto2_l47" name="canto2_l47"></a>
<i>Emblem of Life</i>, l. 47. The Egyptian figure of Venus
rising from the sea seems to have represented the Beauty of organic
Nature; which the philosophers of that country, the magi, appear to
have discovered to have been elevated by earthquakes from the primeval
ocean. But the hieroglyphic figure of Adonis seems to have signified
the spirit of animation or life, which was perpetually wooed or
courted by organic matter, and which perished and revived alternately.
Afterwards the fable of Adonis seems to have given origin to the first
religion promising a resurrection from the dead; whence his funeral
and return to life were celebrated for many ages in Egypt and Syria,
the ceremonies of which Ezekiel complains as idolatrous, accusing the
women of Israel of lamenting over Thammus; which St. Cyril interprets
to be Adonis, in his Commentaries on Isaiah; Danet's Diction.<a href="#c2_l47"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

European oceans, frequent at the tables of the luxurious, a living
repast! New-born oysters swim swiftly by an undulating movement of
fins thrust out a little way from their shells. Syst. Nat. But they do
not afterwards change their place during their whole lives, and are
capable of no other movement but that of opening the shell a little
way: whence Professor Beckman observes, that their offspring is
probably produced without maternal organs; and that those, who speak
of male and female oysters, must be mistaken: Phil. Magaz. March 1800.
It is also observed by H. I. le Beck, that on nice inspection of the
Pearl oysters in the gulf of Manar, he could observe no distinction of
sexes. Nicholson's Journal. April 1800.<a href="#c2_l89"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<i>And coral insects</i>, l. 90. The coral habitation of the
Madrepora of Linneus consists of one or more star-like cells; a
congeries of which form rocks beneath the sea; the animal which
constructs it is termed Medusa; and as it adheres to its calcareous
cavity, and thence cannot travel to its neighbours, is probably
without sex. I observed great masses of the limestone in Shropshire,
which is brought to Newport, to consist of the cells of these
animals.<a href="#c2_l90"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto2_l114" name="canto2_l114"></a>
<i>A softer sex</i>, l. 114. The first buds of trees raised from
seed die annually, and are succeeded by new buds by solitary
reproduction; which are larger or more perfect for several successive
years, and then they produce sexual flowers, which are succeeded by
seminal reproduction. The same occurs in bulbous rooted plants raised
from seed; they die annually, and produce others rather more perfect
than the parent for several years, and then produce sexual flowers.
The Aphis is in a similar manner hatched from an egg in the vernal
months, and produces a viviparous offspring without sexual intercourse
for nine or ten successive generations; and then the progeny is both
male and female, which cohabit, and from these new females are
produced eggs, which endure the winter; the same process probably
occurs in many other insects.<a href="#c2_l114"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

39. 6. 3. It is not to be understood, that the first living fibres,
which are to form an animal, are produced by imagination, with any
similarity of form to the future animal; but with appetencies or
propensities, which shall produce by accretion of parts the similarity
of form and feature, or of sex, corresponding with the imagination of
the father.<a href="#c2_l118"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<i>His nymphs and swains</i>, l. 122. The arguments which have
been adduced to show, that mankind and quadrupeds were formerly in an
hermaphrodite state, are first deduced from the present existence of
breasts and nipples in all the males; which latter swell on
titillation like those of the females, and which are said to contain a
milky fluid at their birth; and it is affirmed, that some men have
given milk to their children in desert countries, where the mother has
perished; as the male pigeon is said to give a kind of milk from his
stomach along with the regurgitated food, to the young doves, as
mentioned in Additional Note IX. on Storge.</p>

<p>Secondly, from the apparent progress of many animals to greater
perfection, as in some insects, as the flies with two wings, termed
Diptera; which have rudiments of two other wings, called halteres, or
poisers; and in many flowers which have rudiments of new stamina, or
filaments without anthers on them. See Botanic Garden, Vol. II.
Curcuma, Note, and the Note on l. 204 of Canto I. of this work. It has
been supposed by some, that mankind were formerly quadrupeds as well
as hermaphrodites; and that some parts of the body are not yet so
convenient to an erect attitude as to a horizontal one; as the fundus
of the bladder in an erect posture is not exactly over the insertion
of the urethra; whence it is seldom completely evacuated, and thus
renders mankind more subject to the stone, than if he had preserved
his horizontality: these philosophers, with Buffon and Helvetius, seem
to imagine, that mankind arose from one family of monkeys on the banks
of the Mediterranean; who accidentally had learned to use the adductor
pollicis, or that strong muscle which constitutes the ball of the
thumb, and draws the point of it to meet the points of the fingers;
which common monkeys do not; and that this muscle gradually increased
in size, strength, and activity, in successive generations; and by
this improved use of the sense of touch, that monkeys acquired clear
ideas, and gradually became men.</p>

<p>Perhaps all the productions of nature are in their progress to greater
perfection! an idea countenanced by modern discoveries and deductions
concerning the progressive formation of the solid parts of the
terraqueous globe, and consonant to the dignity of the Creator of all
things.<a href="#c2_l122"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

those apple and pear trees, which had been propagated for above a
century by ingraftment were now so unhealthy, as not to be worth
cultivation. I have suspected the diseases of potatoes attended with
the curled leaf, and of strawberry plants attended with barren
flowers, to be owing to their having been too long raised from roots,
or by solitary reproduction, and not from seeds, or sexual
reproduction, and to have thence acquired those hereditary diseases.<a href="#c2_l167"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

emblem of the soul after death as rising from the tomb of its former
state, and becoming a winged inhabitant of air from an insect creeping
upon earth. At length the wings only were given to a beautiful nymph
under the name of Psyche, which is the greek word for the soul, and
also became afterwards to signify a butterfly probably from the
popularity of this allegory. Many allegorical designs of Cupid or Love
warming a butterfly or the Soul with his torch may be seen in Spence's
Polymetis, and a beautiful one of their marriage in Bryant's
Mythology; from which this description is in part taken.<a href="#c2_l223"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<i>From the nectar'd cup</i>, l. 268. The anthers and stigmas of
flowers are probably nourished by the honey, which is secreted by the
honey-gland called by Linneus the nectary; and possess greater
sensibility or animation than other parts of the plant. The corol of
the flower appears to be a respiratory organ belonging to these
anthers and stigmas for the purpose of further oxygenating the
vegetable blood for the production of the anther dust and of this
honey, which is also exposed to the air in its receptacle or
honey-cup; which, I suppose, to be necessary for its further
oxygenation, as in many flowers so complicate an apparatus is formed
for its protection from insects, as in aconitum, delphinium, larkspur,
lonicera, woodbine; and because the corol and nectary fall along with
the anthers and stigmas, when the pericarp is impregnated.</p>

<p>Dr. B. S. Barton in the American Transactions has lately shown, that
the honey collected from some plants is intoxicating and poisonous to
men, as from rhododendron, azalea, and datura; and from some other
plants that it is hurtful to the bees which collect it; and that from
some flowers it is so injurious or disagreeable, that they do not
collect it, as from the fritillaria or crown imperial of this
country.<a href="#c2_l268"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto2_l271" name="canto2_l271"></a>
<i>With appetencies just</i>, l. 271. As in the productions by
chemical affinity one set of particles must possess the power of
attraction, and the other the aptitude to be attracted, as when iron
approaches a magnet; so when animal particles unite, whether in
digestion or reproduction, some of them must possess an appetite to
unite, and others a propensity to be united. The former of these are
secreted by the anthers from the vegetable blood, and the latter by
the styles or pericarp; see the Additional Note <a href="#notes8">VIII</a>. on

<p class="p2"><a id="canto2_l280" name="canto2_l280"></a>
<i>Of bright Vallisner</i>, l. 280. Vallisneria, of the class of
dioecia. The flowers of the male plant are produced under water, and
as soon as their farina or dust is mature, they detach themselves from
the plant, rise to the surface and continue to flourish, and are
wafted by the air or borne by the current to the female flowers. In
this they resemble those tribes of insects, where the males at certain
seasons acquire wings, but not the females, as ants, coccus, lampyris,
phalæna, brumata, lichanella; Botanic Garden, Vol. II. Note on
Vallisneria.<a href="#c2_l280"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<i>And young Lampyris</i>, l. 288. The fire-fly is at some
seasons so luminous, that M. Merian says, that by putting two of them
under a glass, she was able to draw her figures of them by night.
Whether the light of this and of other insects be caused by their
amatorial passion, and thus assists them to find each other; or is
caused by respiration, which is so analogous to combustion; or to a
tendency to putridity, as in dead fish and rotten wood, is still to be
investigated; see Botanic Garden, Vol. I. Additional Note IX.<a href="#c2_l288"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto2_l302" name="canto2_l302"></a>
<i>Untasted honey</i>, l. 302. The numerous moths and
butterflies seem to pass from a reptile leaf-eating state, and to
acquire wings to flit in air, with a proboscis to gain honey for their
food along with their organs of reproduction, solely for the purpose
of propagating their species by sexual intercourse, as they die when
that is completed. By the use of their wings they have access to each
other on different branches or on different vegetables, and by living
upon honey probably acquire a higher degree of animation, and thus
seem to resemble the anthers of flowers, which probably are supported
by honey only, and thence acquire greater sensibility; see Note on
<a href="#canto2_l280">Vallisneria</a>, l. 280 of this Canto.</p>

<p>A naturalist, who had studied this subject, thought it not impossible
that the first insects were the anthers and stigmas of flowers, which
had by some means loosened themselves from their parent plant, like
the male flowers of vallisneria, and that other insects in process of
time had been formed from these, some acquiring wings, others fins,
and others claws, from their ceaseless efforts to procure food or to
secure themselves from injury. He contends, that none of these changes
are more incomprehensible than the transformation of caterpillars into
butterflies; see Botanic Garden, Vol. I. Additional Note XXXIX.<a href="#c2_l302"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto2_l321" name="canto2_l321"></a>
<i>There the hoarse stag</i>, l. 321. A great want of one part
of the animal world has consisted in the desire of the exclusive
possession of the females; and these have acquired weapons to combat
each other for this purpose, as the very thick shield-like horny skin
on the shoulder of the boar is a defence only against animals of his
own species, who strike obliquely upwards, nor are his tushes for
other purposes, except to defend himself, as he is not naturally a
carnivorous animal. So the horns of the stag are sharp to offend his
adversary, but are branched for the purpose of parrying or receiving
the thrusts of horns similar to his own, and have therefore been
formed for the purpose of combating other stags for the exclusive
possession of the females, who are observed, like the ladies in the
times of chivalry, to attend the car of the victor.</p>

<p>The birds, which do not carry food to their young, and do not
therefore marry, are armed with spurs for the purpose of fighting for
the exclusive possession of the females, as cocks and quails. It is
certain that these weapons are not provided for their defence against
other adversaries, because the females of these species are without
this armour; Zoonomia, Sect. XXXIX. 4, 8.<a href="#c2_l321"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<i>Hears the young prisoner</i>, l. 351. The air-vessel at the
broad end of an incubated egg gradually extends its edges along the
sides of the shell, as the chick enlarges, but is at the same time
applied closer to the internal surface of the shell; when the time of
hatching approaches the chick is liable to break this air-bag with its
beak, and thence begin to breathe and to chirp; at this time the edges
of the enlarged air-bag extend so as to cover internally one
hemisphere of the egg; and as one half of the external shell is thus
moist, and the other half dry, as soon as the mother hearing the chick
chirp, or the chick itself wanting respirable air, strikes the egg,
about its equatorial line, it breaks into two hemispheres, and
liberates the prisoner.<a href="#c2_l351"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<i>And whisper to the song</i>, l. 356. A curious circumstance
is mentioned by Kircherus de Musurgia, in his Chapter de Lusciniis.
"That the young nightingales, that are hatched under other birds,
never sing till they are instructed by the company of other
nightingales." And Johnston affirms, that the nightingales that visit
Scotland, have not the same harmony as those of Italy, (Pennant's
Zoology, octavo, p. 255), which would lead us to suspect, that the
singing of birds, like human music, is an artificial language rather
than a natural expression of passion.<a href="#c2_l356"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<i>With undulating train</i>, l. 373. The side fins of fish seem
to be chiefly used to poise them; as they turn upon their backs
immediately when killed, the air-bladder assists them perhaps to rise
or descend by its possessing the power to condense the air in it by
muscular contraction; and it is possible, that at great depths in the
ocean the air in this receptacle may by the great pressure of the
incumbent water become condensed into so small a space, as to cease to
be useful to the animal, which was possibly the cause of the death of
Mr. Day in his diving ship. See note on Ulva, Botan. Gard. V. II.</p>

<p>The progressive motion of fish beneath the water is produced
principally by the undulation of their tails. One oblique plain of a
part of the tail on the right side of the fish strikes the water at
the same time that another oblique plain strikes it on the left side,
hence in respect to moving to the right or left these percussions of
the water counteract each other, but they coincide in respect to the
progression of the fish; this power seems to be better applied to push
forwards a body in water, than the oars of boats, as the particles of
water recede from the stroke of the oar, whence the comparative power
acquired is but as the difference of velocity between the striking oar
and the receding water. So a ship moves swifter with an oblique wind,
than with a wind of the same velocity exactly behind it; and the
common windmill sail placed obliquely to the wind is more powerful
than one which directly recedes from it. Might not some machinery
resembling the tails of fish be placed behind a boat, so as to be
moved with greater effect than common oars, by the force of wind or
steam, or perhaps by hand?<a href="#c2_l373"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto2_l375" name="canto2_l375"></a>
<i>On pinions broad display'd</i>, l. 375. The progressive
motion of birds in the air is principally performed by the movement of
their wings, and not by that of their tails as in fish. The bird is
supported in an element so much lighter than itself by the resistance
of the air as it moves horizontally against the oblique plain made by
its breast, expanded tail and wings, when they are at rest; the change
of this obliquity also assists it to rise, and even directs its
descent, though this is owing principally to its specific gravity, but
it is in all situations kept upright or balanced by its wings.</p>

<p>As the support of the bird in the air, as well as its progression, is
performed by the motion of the wings; these require strong muscles as
are seen on the breasts of partridges. Whence all attempts of men to
fly by wings applied to the weak muscles of their arms have been
ineffectual; but it is not certain whether light machinery so
contrived as to be moved by their feet, might not enable them to fly a
little way, though not so as to answer any useful purpose.<a href="#c2_l375"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<i>With laugh repress'd</i>, l. 434. The cause of the violent
actions of laughter, and of the difficulty of restraining them, is a
curious subject of inquiry. When pain afflicts us, which we cannot
avoid, we learn to relieve it by great voluntary exertions, as in
grinning, holding the breath, or screaming; now the pleasurable
sensation, which excites laughter, arises for a time so high as to
change its name, and become a painful one; and we excite the
convulsive motions of the respiratory muscles to relieve this pain. We
are however unwilling to lose the pleasure, and presently put a stop
to this exertion; and immediately the pleasure recurs, and again as
instantly rises into pain. Which is further explained in Zoonomia,
Sect. 34. 1. 4. When this pleasurable sensation rises into a painful
one, and the customs of society will not permit us to laugh aloud,
some other violent voluntary exertion is used instead of it to
alleviate the pain.<a href="#c2_l434"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<i>With smile chastised</i>, l. 434. The origin of the smile has
generally been ascribed to inexplicable instinct, but may be deduced
from our early associations of actions and ideas. In the act of
sucking, the lips of the infant are closed round the nipple of its
mother, till it has filled its stomach, and the pleasure of digesting
this grateful food succeeds; then the sphincter of the mouth, fatigued
by the continued action of sucking, is relaxed; and the antagonist
muscles of the face gently acting, produce the smile of pleasure,
which is thus during our lives associated with gentle pleasure, which
is further explained in Zoonomia, Sect. 16. 8. 4.<a href="#c2_l434b"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<i>How Oxygen</i>, l. 13. The atmosphere which surrounds us, is
composed of twenty-seven parts of oxygen gas and seventy-three of
azote or nitrogen gas, which are simply diffused together, but which,
when combined, become nitrous acid. Water consists of eighty-six parts
oxygen, and fourteen parts of hydrogen or inflammable air, in a state
of combination. It is also probable, that much oxygen enters the
composition of glass; as those materials which promote vitrification,
contain so much of it, as minium and manganese; and that glass is
hence a solid acid in the temperature of our atmosphere, as water is a
fluid one.<a href="#c3_l13"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto3_l21" name="canto3_l21"></a>
<i>Two electric streams</i>, l. 21. It is the opinion of some
philosophers, that the electric ether consists of two kinds of fluids
diffused together or combined; which are commonly known by the terms
of positive and negative electricity, but are by these electricians
called vitreous and resinous electricity. The electric shocks given by
the torpedo and by the gymnotus, are supposed to be similar to those
of the Galvanic pile, as they are produced in water. Which water is
decomposed by the Galvanic pile and converted into oxygen and hydrogen
gas; see Additional Note <a href="#notes12">XII</a>.</p>

<p>The magnetic ether may also be supposed to consist of two fluids, one
of which attracts the needle, and the other repels it; and, perhaps,
chemical affinities, and gravitation itself, may consist of two kinds
of ether surrounding the particles of bodies, and may thence attract
at one distance and repel at another; as appears when two insulated
electrised balls are approached to each other, or when two small
globules of mercury are pressed together.<a href="#c3_l21"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<i>And Irritation moves</i>, l. 64. Irritation is an exertion or
change of some extreme part of the sensorium residing in the muscles
or organs of sense in consequence of the appulses of external bodies.
The word perception includes both the action of the organ of sense in
consequence of the impact of external objects and our attention to
that action; that is, it expresses both the motion of the organ of
sense, or idea, and the pain or pleasure that succeeds or accompanies
it. Irritative ideas are those which are preceded by irritation, which
is excited by objects external to the organs of sense: as the idea of
that tree, which either I attend to, or which I shun in walking near
it without attention. In the former case it is termed perception, in
the latter it is termed simply an irritative idea.<a href="#c3_l64"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto3_l72" name="canto3_l72"></a>
<i>And young Sensation</i>, l. 72. Sensation is an exertion or
change of the central parts of the sensorium or of the whole of it,
<i>beginning</i> at some of those extreme parts of it which reside in the
muscles or organs of sense. Sensitive ideas are those which are
preceded by the sensation of pleasure or pain, are termed Imagination,
and constitute our dreams and reveries.<a href="#c3_l72"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto3_l73" name="canto3_l73"></a>
<i>Quick Volition springs</i>, l. 73. Volition is an exertion or
change of the central parts of the sensorium, or of the whole of it
<i>terminating</i> in some of those extreme parts of it which reside in the
muscles and organs of sense. The vulgar use of the word <i>memory</i> is
too unlimited for our purpose: those ideas which we voluntarily recall
are here termed ideas of <i>recollection</i>, as when we will to repeat the
alphabet backwards. And those ideas which are suggested to us by
preceding ideas are here termed ideas of <i>suggestion</i>, as whilst we
repeat the alphabet in the usual order; when by habits previously
acquired B is suggested by A, and C by B, without any effort of
deliberation. Reasoning is that operation of the sensorium by which we
excite two or many tribes of ideas, and then reexcite the ideas in
which they differ or correspond. If we determine this difference, it
is called judgment; if we in vain endeavour to determine it, it is
called doubting.</p>

<p>If we reexcite the ideas in which they differ, it is called
distinguishing. If we reexcite those in which they correspond, it is
called comparing.<a href="#c3_l73"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<i>Each passing moment</i>, l. 81. During our waking hours, we
perpetually compare the passing trains of our ideas with the known
system of nature, and reject those which are incongruous with it; this
is explained in Zoonomia, Sect. XVII. 3. 7. and is there termed
Intuitive Analogy. When we sleep, the faculty of volition ceases to
act, and in consequence the uncompared trains of ideas become
incongruous and form the farrago of our dreams; in which we never
experience any surprise, or sense of novelty.<a href="#c3_l81"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto3_l91" name="canto3_l91"></a>
<i>Association steers</i>, l. 91. Association is an exertion or
change of some extreme part of the sensorium residing in the muscles
and organs of sense in consequence of some antecedent or attendant
fibrous contractions. Associate ideas, therefore, are those which are
preceded by other ideas or muscular motions, without the intervention
of irritation, sensation, or volition between them; these are also
termed ideas of suggestion.<a href="#c3_l91"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<i>The branching forehead</i>, l. 103. The peculiarities of the
shapes of animals which distinguish them from each other, are
enumerated in Zoonomia, Sect. XXXIX. 4. 8. on Generation, and are
believed to have been gradually formed from similar living fibres, and
are varied by reproduction. Many of these parts of animals are there
shown to have arisen from their three great desires of lust, hunger,
and security.<a href="#c3_l103"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<i>The hand, first gift of Heaven</i>, l. 122. The human species
in some of their sensations are much inferior to animals, yet the
accuracy of the sense of touch, which they possess in so eminent a
degree, gives them a great superiority of understanding; as is well
observed by the ingenious Mr. Buffon. The extremities of other animals
terminate in horns, and hoofs, and claws, very unfit for the sensation
of touch; whilst the human hand is finely adapted to encompass its
object with this organ of sense. Those animals who have clavicles or
collar-bones, and thence use their forefeet like hands, as cats,
squirrels, monkeys, are more ingenious than other quadrupeds, except
the elephant, who has a fine sense at the extremity of his proboscis;
and many insects from the possessing finer organs of touch have
greater ingenuity, as spiders, bees, wasps.<a href="#c3_l122"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto3_l125" name="canto3_l125"></a>
<i>Trace the nice lines of form</i>, l. 125. When the idea of
solidity is excited a part of the extensive organ of touch is
compressed by some external body, and this part of the sensorium so
compressed exactly resembles in figure the figure of the body that
compressed it. Hence when we acquire the idea of solidity, we acquire
at the same time the idea of figure; and this idea of figure, or
motion of a part of the organ of touch, exactly resembles in its
figure the figure of the body that occasions it; and thus exactly
acquaints us with this property of the external world.</p>

<p>Now, as the whole universe with all its parts possesses a certain form
or figure, if any part of it moves, that form or figure of the whole
is varied. Hence, as motion is no other than a perpetual variation of
figure, our idea of motion is also a real resemblance of the motion
that produced it.</p>

<p>Hence arises the certainty of the mathematical sciences, as they
explain these properties of bodies, which are exactly resembled by our
ideas of them, whilst we are obliged to collect almost all our other
knowledge from experiment; that is, by observing the effects exerted
by one body upon another.<a href="#c3_l125"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto3_l144" name="canto3_l144"></a>
<i>The mute language of the touch</i>, l. 144. Our eyes observe
a difference of colour, or of shade, in the prominences and
depressions of objects, and that those shades uniformly vary when the
sense of touch observes any variation. Hence when the retina becomes
stimulated by colours or shades of light in a certain form, as in a
circular spot, we know by experience that this is a sign that a
tangible body is before us; and that its figure is resembled by the
miniature figure of the part of the organ of vision that is thus
stimulated.</p>

<p>Here whilst the stimulated part of the retina resembles exactly the
visible figure of the whole in miniature, the various kinds of stimuli
from different colours mark the visible figures of the minuter parts;
and by habit we instantly recall the tangible figures.</p>

<p>So that though our visible ideas resemble in miniature the outline of
the figure of coloured bodies, in other respects they serve only as a
language, which by acquired associations introduce the tangible ideas
of bodies. Hence it is, that this sense is so readily deceived by the
art of the painter to our amusement and instruction. The reader will
find much very curious knowledge on this subject in Bishop Berkeley's
Essay on Vision, a work of great ingenuity.<a href="#c3_l144"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto3_l145" name="canto3_l145"></a>
<i>Starts young Surprise</i>, l. 145. Surprise is occasioned by
the sudden interruption of the usual trains of our ideas by any
violent stimulus from external objects, as from the unexpected
discharge of a pistol, and hence does not exist in our dreams, because
our external senses are closed or inirritable. The fetus in the womb
must experience many sensations, as of resistance, figure, fluidity,
warmth, motion, rest, exertion, taste; and must consequently possess
trains both of waking and sleeping ideas. Surprise must therefore be
strongly excited at its nativity, as those trains of ideas must
instantly be dissevered by the sudden and violent sensations
occasioned by the dry and cold atmosphere, the hardness of external
bodies, light, sound, and odours; which are accompanied with pleasure
or pain according to their quantity or intensity.</p>

<p>As some of these sensations become familiar by repetition, other
objects not previously attended to present themselves, and produce the
idea of novelty, which is a less degree of surprise, and like that is
not perceived in our dreams, though for another reason; because in
sleep we possess no voluntary power to compare our trains of ideas
with our previous knowledge of nature, and do not therefore perceive
their difference by intuitive analogy from what usually occurs.</p>

<p>As the novelty of our ideas is generally attended with pleasurable
sensation, from this arises Curiosity, or a desire of examining a
variety of objects, hoping to find novelty, and the pleasure
consequent to this degree of surprise; see Additional Note <a href="#notes7_3">VII. 3</a>.<a href="#c3_l145"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto3_l152" name="canto3_l152"></a>
<i>And meeting lips</i>, l. 152. Young children put small bodies
into their mouths, when they are satiated with food, as well as when
they are hungry, not with design to taste them, but use their lips as
an organ of touch to distinguish the shape of them. Puppies, whose
toes are terminated with nails, and who do not much use their forefeet
as hands, seem to have no other means of acquiring a knowledge of the
forms of external bodies, and are therefore perpetually playing with
things by taking them between their lips.<a href="#c3_l152"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto3_l169" name="canto3_l169"></a>
<i>Seeks with spread hands</i>, l. 169. These eight beautiful
lines are copied from Mr. Bilsborrow's Address prefixed to Zoonomia,
and are translated from that work; Sect. XVI. 6.<a href="#c3_l169"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto3_l176" name="canto3_l176"></a>
<i>Ideal Beauty</i>, l. 176. Sentimental Love, as distinguished
from the animal passion of that name, with which it is frequently
accompanied, consists in the desire or sensation of beholding,
embracing, and saluting a beautiful object.</p>

<p>The characteristic of beauty therefore is that it is the object of
love; and though many other objects are in common language called
beautiful, yet they are only called so metaphorically, and ought to be
termed agreeable. A Grecian temple may give us the pleasurable idea of
sublimity, a Gothic temple may give us the pleasurable idea of
variety, and a modern house the pleasurable idea of utility; music and
poetry may inspire our love by association of ideas; but none of
these, except metaphorically, can be termed beautiful, as we have no
wish to embrace or salute them.</p>

<p>Our perception of beauty consists in our recognition by the sense of
vision of those objects, first, which have before inspired our love by
the pleasure, which they have afforded to many of our senses; as to
our sense of warmth, of touch, of smell, of taste, hunger and thirst;
and, secondly, which bear any analogy of form to such objects.<a href="#c3_l176"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto3_l178" name="canto3_l178"></a>
<i>Alights young Eros</i>, l. 178. There were two deities of
Love belonging to the heathen mythology, the one said to be celestial,
and the other terrestrial. Aristophanes says, "Sable-winged Night
produced an egg, from which sprung up like a blossom Eros, the lovely,
the desirable, with his glossy golden wings." See Botanic Garden,
Canto I. l. 412. Note. The other deity of Love, Cupido, seems of much
later date, as he is not mentioned in the works of Homer, where there
were so many apt situations to have introduced him.<a href="#c3_l178"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto3_l207" name="canto3_l207"></a>
<i>The wavy lawns</i>, l. 207. When the babe, soon after it is
born into this cold world, is applied to its mother's bosom; its sense
of perceiving warmth is first agreeably affected; next its sense of
smell is delighted with the odour of her milk; then its taste is
gratified by the flavour of it; afterwards the appetites of hunger and
of thirst afford pleasure by the possession of their objects, and by
the subsequent digestion of the aliment; and lastly, the sense of
touch is delighted by the softness and smoothness of the milky
fountain, the source of such variety of happiness.</p>

<p>All these various kinds of pleasure at length become associated with
the form of the mother's breast; which the infant embraces with its
hands, presses with its lips, and watches with its eyes; and thus
acquires more accurate ideas of the form of its mother's bosom, than
of the odour and flavour or warmth, which it perceives by its other
senses. And hence at our maturer years, when any object of vision is
presented to us, which by its waving or spiral lines bears any
similitude to the form of the female bosom, whether it be found in a
landscape with soft gradations of rising and descending surface, or in
the forms of some antique vases, or in other works of the pencil or
the chisel, we feel a general glow of delight, which seems to
influence all our senses; and if the object be not too large, we
experience an attraction to embrace it with our arms, and to salute it
with our lips, as we did in our early infancy the bosom of our mother.
And thus we find, according to the ingenious idea of Hogarth, that the
waving lines of beauty were originally taken from the temple of
Venus.<a href="#c3_l207"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto3_l230" name="canto3_l230"></a>
<i>With his arm sublime</i>, l. 230. Objects of taste have been
generally divided into the beautiful, the sublime, and the new; and
lately to these have been added the picturesque. The beautiful so well
explained in Hogarth's analysis of beauty, consists of curved lines
and smooth surfaces, as expressed in the preceding note; any object
larger than usual, as a very large temple or a very large mountain,
gives us the idea of sublimity; with which is often confounded the
terrific, and the melancholic: what is now termed picturesque includes
objects, which are principally neither sublime nor beautiful, but
which by their variety and intricacy joined with a due degree of
regularity or uniformity convey to the mind an agreeable sentiment of
novelty. Many other agreeable sentiments may be excited by visible
objects, thus to the sublime and beautiful may be added the terrific,
tragic, melancholic, artless, &amp;c. while novelty superinduces a charm
upon them all. See Additional Note <a href="#notes13">XIII</a>.<a href="#c3_l230"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto3_l237" name="canto3_l237"></a>
<i>Poetic melancholy treads</i>, l. 237. The pleasure arising
from the contemplation of the ruins of ancient grandeur or of ancient
happiness, and here termed poetic melancholy, arises from a
combination of the painful idea of sorrow with the pleasurable idea of
the grandeur or happiness of past times; and becomes very interesting
to us by fixing our attention more strongly on that grandeur and
happiness, as the passion of Pity mentioned in the succeeding note is
a combination of the painful idea of sorrow with the pleasurable one
of beauty, or of virtue.<a href="#c3_l237"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto3_l246" name="canto3_l246"></a>
<i>The tragic Muse</i>, l. 246. Why we are delighted with the
scenical representations of Tragedy, which draw tears from our eyes,
has been variously explained by different writers. The same
distressful circumstance attending an ugly or wicked person affects us
with grief or disgust; but when distress occurs to a beauteous or
virtuous person, the pleasurable idea of beauty or of virtue becomes
mixed with the painful one of sorrow and the passion of Pity is
produced, which is a combination of love or esteem with sorrow; and
becomes highly interesting to us by fixing our attention more
intensely on the beauteous or virtuous person.</p>

<p>Other distressful scenes have been supposed to give pleasure to the
spectator from exciting a comparative idea of his own happiness, as
when a shipwreck is viewed by a person safe on shore, as mentioned by
Lucretius, L. 3. But these dreadful situations belong rather to the
terrible, or the horrid, than to the tragic; and may be objects of
curiosity from their novelty, but not of Taste, and must suggest much
more pain than pleasure.<a href="#c3_l246"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto3_l258" name="canto3_l258"></a>
<i>Nature unchastised</i>, l. 258. In cities or their vicinity,
and even in the cultivated parts of the country we rarely see
undisguised nature; the fields are ploughed, the meadows mown, the
shrubs planted in rows for hedges, the trees deprived of their lower
branches, and the animals, as horses, dogs, and sheep, are mutilated
in respect to their tails or ears; such is the useful or ill-employed
activity of mankind! all which alterations add to the formality of the
soil, plants, trees, or animals; whence when natural objects are
occasionally presented to us, as an uncultivated forest and its wild
inhabitants, we are not only amused with greater variety of form, but
are at the same time enchanted by the charm of novelty, which is a
less degree of Surprise, already spoken of in note on l. 145 of this
Canto.<a href="#c3_l258"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto3_l270" name="canto3_l270"></a>
<i>When rest accumulates</i>, l. 270. The accumulation of the
spirit of animation, when those parts of the system rest, which are
usually in motion, produces a disagreeable sensation. Whence the pain
of cold and of hunger, and the irksomeness of a continued attitude,
and of an indolent life: and hence the propensity to action in those
confined animals, which have been accustomed to activity, as is seen
in the motions of a squirrel in a cage; which uses perpetual exertion
to exhaust a part of its accumulated sensorial power. This is one
source of our general propensity to action; another perhaps arises
from our curiosity or expectation of novelty mentioned in the note on
l. 145. of this canto.</p>

<p>But the immediate cause of our propensity to imitation above that of
other animals arises from the greater facility, with which by the
sense of touch we acquire the ideas of the outlines of objects, and
afterwards in consequence by the sense of sight; this seems to have
been observed by Aristotle, who calls man, "the imitative animal;" see
Zoonomia, Vol. I. Sect. XXII.<a href="#c3_l270"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto3_l294" name="canto3_l294"></a>
<i>Another sense</i>, l. 294. As the part of the organs of touch
or of sight, which is stimulated into action by a tangible or visible
object, must resemble in figure at least the figure of that object, as
it thus constitutes an idea; it may be said to imitate the figure of
that object; and thus imitation may be esteemed coeval with the
existence both of man and other animals: but this would confound
perception with imitation; which latter is better defined from the
actions of one sense copying those of another.<a href="#c3_l294"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto3_l303" name="canto3_l303"></a>
<i>Thus when great Angelo</i>, l. 303. The origin of this
propensity to imitation has not been deduced from any known principle;
when any action presents itself to the view of a child, as of whetting
a knife, or threading a needle; the parts of this action in respect of
time, motion, figure, are imitated by parts of the retina of his eye;
to perform this action therefore with his hands is easier to him than
to invent any new action; because it consists in repeating with
another set of fibres, viz. with the moving muscles, what he had just
performed by some parts of the retina; just as in dancing we transfer
the times of the motions from the actions of the auditory nerves to
the muscles of the limbs. Imitation therefore consists of repetition,
which is the easiest kind of animal action; as the ideas or motions
become presently associated together; which adds to the facility of
their production; as shown in Zoonomia, Vol. I. Sect. XXII. 2.</p>

<p>It should be added, that as our ideas, when we perceive external
objects, are believed to consist in the actions of the immediate
organs of sense in consequence of the stimulus of those objects; so
when we think of external objects, our ideas are believed to consist
in the repetitions of the actions of the immediate organs of sense,
excited by the other sensorial powers of volition, sensation, or
association.<a href="#c3_l303"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<i>The Muse of Mimicry</i>, l. 319. Much of the pleasure
received from the drawings of flowers finely finished, or of
portraits, is derived from their imitation or resemblance of the
objects or persons which they represent. The same occurs in the
pleasure we receive from mimicry on the stage; we are surprised at the
accuracy of its enacted resemblance. Some part of the pleasure
received from architecture, as when we contemplate the internal
structure of gothic temples, as of King's College chapel in Cambridge,
or of Lincoln Cathedral, may arise also from their imitation or
resemblance of those superb avenues of large trees, which were
formerly appropriated to religious ceremonies.<a href="#c3_l319"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto3_l334" name="canto3_l334"></a>
<i>Imitation marks</i>, l. 334. Many other curious instances of
one part of the animal system imitating another part of it, as in some
contagious diseases; and also of some animals imitating each other,
are given in Zoonomia, Vol. I. Sect. XXII. 3. To which may be added,
that this propensity to imitation not only appears in the actions of
children, but in all the customs and fashions of the world; many
thousands tread in the beaten paths of others, who precede or
accompany them, for one who traverses regions of his own discovery.<a href="#c3_l334"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto3_l342" name="canto3_l342"></a>
<i>And the first Language</i>, l. 342. There are two ways by
which we become acquainted with the passions of others: first, by
having observed the effects of them, as of fear or anger, on our own
bodies, we know at sight when others are under the influence of these
affections. So children long before they can speak, or understand the
language of their parents, may be frightened by an angry countenance,
or soothed by smiles and blandishments.</p>

<p>Secondly, when we put ourselves into the attitude that any passion
naturally occasions, we soon in some degree acquire that passion;
hence when those that scold indulge themselves in loud oaths and
violent actions of the arms, they increase their anger by the mode of
expressing themselves; and, on the contrary, the counterfeited smile
of pleasure in disagreeable company soon brings along with it a
portion of the reality, as is well illustrated by Mr. Burke. (Essay on
the Sublime and Beautiful.)</p>

<p>These are natural signs by which we understand each other, and on this
slender basis is built all human language. For without some natural
signs no artificial ones could have been invented or understood, as is
very ingeniously observed by Dr. Reid. (Inquiry into the Human Mind.)<a href="#c3_l342"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto3_l371" name="canto3_l371"></a>
<i>Hence the first accents</i>, l. 371. Words were originally
the signs or names of individual ideas; but in all known languages
many of them by changing their terminations express more than one
idea, as in the cases of nouns, and the moods and tenses of verbs.
Thus a whip suggests a single idea of that instrument; but "to whip,"
suggests an idea of action, joined with that of the instrument, and is
then called a verb; and "to be whipped," suggests an idea of being
acted upon or suffering. Thus in most languages two ideas are
suggested by one word by changing its termination; as amor, love;
amare, to love; amari, to be loved.</p>

<p>Nouns are the names of the ideas of things, first as they are received
by the stimulus of objects, or as they are afterwards repeated;
secondly, they are names of more abstracted ideas, which do not
suggest at the same time the external objects, by which they were
originally excited; or thirdly, of the operations of our minds, which
are termed reflex ideas by metaphysical writers; or lastly, they are
the names of our ideas of parts or properties of objects; and are
termed by grammarians nouns adjective.</p>

<p>Verbs are also in reality names of our ideas of things, or nouns, with
the addition of another idea to them, as of acting or suffering; or of
more than one other annexed idea, as of time, and also of existence.
These with the numerous abbreviations, so well illustrated by Mr.
Horne Tooke in his Diversions of Purley, make up the general theory of
language, which consists of the symbols of ideas represented by vocal
or written words; or by parts of those words, as their terminations;
or by their disposition in respect to their order or succession; as
further explained in Additional Note XIV.<a href="#c3_l371"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto3_l398" name="canto3_l398"></a>
<i>In parted links</i>, l. 398. As our ideas consist of
successive trains of the motions, or changes of figure, of the
extremities of the nerves of one or more of our senses, as of the
optic or auditory nerves; these successive trains of motion, or
configuration, are in common life divided into many links, to each of
which a word or name is given, and it is called an idea. This chain of
ideas may be broken into more or fewer links, or divided in different
parts of it, by the customs of different people. Whence the meanings
of the words of one language cannot always be exactly expressed by
those of another; and hence the acquirement of different languages in
their infancy may affect the modes of thinking and reasoning of whole
nations, or of different classes of society; as the words of them do
not accurately suggest the same ideas, or parts of ideal trains; a
circumstance which has not been sufficiently analysed.<a href="#c3_l398"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto3_l401" name="canto3_l401"></a>
<i>Whence Reason's empire</i>, l. 401. The facility of the use
of the voluntary power, which is owing to the possession of the clear
ideas acquired by our superior sense of touch, and afterwards of
vision, distinguishes man from brutes, and has given him the empire of
the world, with the power of improving nature by the exertions of art.</p>

<p>Reasoning is that operation of the sensorium by which we excite two or
many tribes of ideas, and then reexcite the ideas in which they differ
or correspond. If we determine this difference, it is called judgment;
if we in vain endeavour to determine it, it is called doubting.</p>

<p>If we reexcite the ideas in which they differ, it is called
distinguishing. If we reexcite those in which they correspond, it is
called comparing.<a href="#c3_l401"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto3_l411" name="canto3_l411"></a>
<i>The Wasp, fine architect</i>, l. 411. Those animals which
possess a better sense of touch are, in general, more ingenious than
others. Those which have claviculæ, or collar-bones, and thence use
the forefeet as hands, as the monkey, squirrel, rat, are more
ingenious in seizing their prey or escaping from danger. And the
ingenuity of the elephant appears to arise from the sense of touch at
the extremity of his proboscis, which has a prominence on one side of
its cavity like a thumb to close against the other side of it, by
which I have seen him readily pick up a shilling which was thrown
amongst the straw he stood upon. Hence the excellence of the sense of
touch in many insects seems to have given them wonderful ingenuity so
as to equal or even excel mankind in some of their arts and
discoveries; many of which may have been acquired in situations
previous to their present ones, as the great globe itself, and all
that it inhabit, appear to be in a perpetual state of mutation and
improvement; see Additional Note <a href="#notes9">IX</a>.<a href="#c3_l411"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto3_l435" name="canto3_l435"></a>
<i>Thy potent acts, Volition</i>, l. 435. It was before
observed, how much the superior accuracy of our sense of touch
contributes to increase our knowledge; but it is the greater energy
and activity of the power of volition, that marks mankind, and has
given them the empire of the world.</p>

<p>There is a criterion by which we may distinguish our voluntary acts or
thoughts from those that are excited by our sensations: "The former
are always employed about the means to acquire pleasurable objects, or
to avoid painful ones; while the latter are employed about the
possession of those that are already in our power."</p>

<p>The ideas and actions of brutes, like those of children, are almost
perpetually produced by their present pleasures or their present
pains; and they seldom busy themselves about the <i>means</i> of procuring
future bliss, or of avoiding future misery.</p>

<p>Whilst the acquiring of languages, the making of tools, and the
labouring for money, which are all only the <i>means</i> of procuring
pleasure; and the praying to the Deity, as another means to procure
happiness, are characteristic of human nature.<a href="#c3_l435"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto3_l456" name="canto3_l456"></a>
<i>And gather'd Right and Wrong</i>, l. 456. Some philosophers
have believed that the acquisition of knowledge diminishes the
happiness of the possessor; an opinion which seems to have been
inculcated by the history of our first parents, who are said to have
become miserable from eating of the tree of knowledge. But as the
foresight and the power of mankind are much increased by their
voluntary exertions in the acquirement of knowledge, they may
undoubtedly avoid many sources of evil, and procure many sources of
good; and yet possess the pleasures of sense, or of imagination, as
extensively as the brute or the savage.<a href="#c3_l456"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto3_l466" name="canto3_l466"></a>
<i>And soft emotions</i>, l. 466. From our aptitude to imitation
arises what is generally understood by the word sympathy, so well
explained by Dr. Smith of Glasgow. Thus the appearance of a cheerful
countenance gives us pleasure, and of a melancholy one makes us
sorrowful. Yawning, and sometimes vomiting, are thus propagated by
sympathy; and some people of delicate fibres, at the presence of a
spectacle of misery, have felt pain in the same parts of their bodies,
that were diseased or mangled in the object they saw.</p>

<p>The effect of this powerful agent in the moral world, is the
foundation of all our intellectual sympathies with the pains and
pleasures of others, and is in consequence the source of all our
virtues. For in what consists our sympathy with the miseries or with
the joys of our fellow creatures, but in an involuntary excitation of
ideas in some measure similar or imitative of those which we believe
to exist in the minds of the persons whom we commiserate or
congratulate!<a href="#c3_l466"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto3_l485" name="canto3_l485"></a>
<i>High on yon scroll</i>, l. 485. The famous sentence of
Socrates "Know thyself," so celebrated by writers of antiquity, and
said by them to have descended from Heaven, however wise it may be,
seems to be rather of a selfish nature; and the author of it might
have added "Know also other people." But the sacred maxims of the
author of Christianity, "Do as you would be done by," and "Love your
neighbour as yourself," include all our duties of benevolence and
morality; and, if sincerely obeyed by all nations, would a
thousandfold multiply the present happiness of mankind.<a href="#c3_l485"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<i>Fell Oestrus buries</i>, l. 29. The gadfly, bot-fly, or
sheep-fly: the larva lives in the bodies of cattle throughout the
whole winter; it is extracted from their backs by an African bird
called Buphaga. Adhering to the anus it artfully introduces itself
into the intestines of horses, and becomes so numerous in their
stomachs, as sometimes to destroy them; it climbs into the nostrils of
sheep and calves, and producing a nest of young in a transparent
hydatide in the frontal sinus, occasions the vertigo or turn of those
animals. In Lapland it so attacks the rein deer that the natives
annually travel with the herds from the woods to the mountains. Lin.

<p class="p2"><a id="canto4_l33" name="canto4_l33"></a>
<i>The wing'd Ichneumon</i>, l. 33. Linneus describes
seventy-seven species of the ichneumon fly, some of which have a sting
as long and some twice as long as their bodies. Many of them insert
their eggs into various caterpillars, which when they are hatched seem
for a time to prey on the reservoir of silk in the backs of those
animals designed for their own use to spin a cord to support them, or
a bag to contain them, while they change from their larva form to a
butterfly; as I have seen in above fifty cabbage-caterpillars. The
ichneumon larva then makes its way out of the caterpillar, and spins
itself a small cocoon like a silk worm; these cocoons are about the
size of a small pin's head, and I have seen about ten of them on each
cabbage caterpillar, which soon dies after their exclusion.</p>

<p>Other species of ichneumon insert their eggs into the aphis, and into
the larva of the aphidivorous fly: others into the bedeguar of rose
trees, and the gall-nuts of oaks; whence those excrescences seem to be
produced, as well as the hydatides in the frontal sinus of sheep and
calves by the stimulus of the larvæ deposited in them.<a href="#c4_l33"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

garden. See Phytologia, Sect. XIV. 3. 7.<a href="#c4_l39"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<i>The shark rapacious</i>, l. 57. The shark has three rows of
sharp teeth within each other, which he can bend downwards internally
to admit larger prey, and raise to prevent its return; his snout hangs
so far over his mouth, that he is necessitated to turn upon his back,
when he takes fish that swim over him, and hence seems peculiarly
formed to catch those that swim under him.<a href="#c4_l57"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto4_l59" name="canto4_l59"></a>
<i>The crawling crocodiles</i>, l. 59. As this animal lives
chiefly at the bottom of the rivers, which he frequents, he has the
power of opening the upper jaw as well as the under one, and thus with
greater facility catches the fish or water-fowl which swim over him.<a href="#c4_l59"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto4_l66" name="canto4_l66"></a>
<i>One great slaughter-house</i>, l. 66. As vegetables are an
inferior order of animals fixed to the soil; and as the locomotive
animals prey upon them, or upon each other; the world may indeed be
said to be one great slaughter-house. As the digested food of
vegetables consists principally of sugar, and from this is produced
again their mucilage, starch, and oil, and since animals are sustained
by these vegetable productions, it would seem that the sugar-making
process carried on in vegetable vessels was the great source of life
to all organized beings. And that if our improved chemistry should
ever discover the art of making sugar from fossile or aerial matter
without the assistance of vegetation, food for animals would then
become as plentiful as water, and they might live upon the earth
without preying on each other, as thick as blades of grass, with no
restraint to their numbers but the want of local room.</p>

<p>It would seem that roots fixed in the earth and leaves innumerable
waving in the air were necessary for the decomposition of water and
air, and the conversion of them into saccharine matter, which would
have been not only cumberous but totally incompatible with the
locomotion of animal bodies. For how could a man or quadruped have
carried on his head or back a forest of leaves, or have had long
branching lacteal or absorbent vessels terminating in the earth?
Animals therefore subsist on vegetables; that is they take the matter
so prepared, and have organs to prepare it further for the purposes of
higher animation and greater sensibility.<a href="#c4_l66"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto4_l71" name="canto4_l71"></a>
<i>While cold and hunger</i>, l. 71. Those parts of our system,
which are in health excited into perpetual action, give us pain, when
they are not excited into action: thus when the hands are for a time
immersed in snow, an inaction of the cutaneous capillaries is induced,
as is seen from the paleness of the skin, which is attended with the
pain of coldness. So the pain of hunger is probably produced by the
inaction of the muscular fibres of the stomach from the want of the
stimulus of food.</p>

<p>Thus those, who have used much voluntary exertion in their early
years, and have continued to do so, till the decline of life
commences, if they then lay aside their employment, whether that of a
minister of state, a general of an army, or a merchant, or
manufacturer; they cease to have their faculties excited into their
usual activity, and become unhappy, I suppose from the too great
accumulation of the sensorial power of volition; which wants the
accustomed stimulus or motive to cause its expenditure.<a href="#c4_l71"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<i>E'en o'er the grave</i>, l. 87. Many theatric preachers among
the Methodists successfully inculcate the fear of death and of Hell,
and live luxuriously on the folly of their hearers: those who suffer
under this insanity, are generally most innocent and harmless people,
who are then liable to accuse themselves of the greatest imaginary
crimes; and have so much intellectual cowardice, that they dare not
reason about those things, which they are directed by their priests to
believe. Where this intellectual cowardice is great, the voice of
reason is ineffectual; but that of ridicule may save many from these
mad-making doctors, as the farces of Mr. Foot; though it is too weak
to cure those who are already hallucinated.<a href="#c4_l87"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto4_l93" name="canto4_l93"></a>
<i>And last association</i>, l. 93. The miseries and the
felicities of life may be divided into those which arise in
consequence of irritation, sensation, volition, and association; and
consist in the actions of the extremities of the nerves of sense,
which constitute our ideas; if they are much more exerted than usual,
or much less exerted than usual, they occasion pain; as when the
finger is burnt in a candle; or when we go into a cold bath: while
their natural degree of exertion produces the pleasure of life or
existence. This pleasure is nevertheless increased, when the system is
stimulated into rather stronger action than usual, as after a copious
dinner, and at the beginning of intoxication; and diminished, when it
is only excited into somewhat less activity than usual, which is
termed ennui, or irksomeness of life.<a href="#c4_l93"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<i>Ideal ills</i>, l. 94. The tooth-edge is an instance of
bodily pain occasioned by association of ideas. Every one in his
childhood has repeatedly bit a part of the glass or earthen vessel, in
which his food has been given him, and has thence had a disagreeable
sensation in his teeth, attended at the same time with a jarring
sound: and ever after, when such a sound is accidentally produced, the
disagreeable sensation of the teeth follows by association of ideas;
this is further elucidated in Zoonomia, Vol. I. Sect. XVI. 10.<a href="#c4_l94"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

their early education to feel for all the remediable evils, which they
observe in others; but they should at the same time be taught
sufficient firmness of mind not intirely to destroy their own
happiness by their sympathizing with too great sensibility with the
numerous irremediable evils, which exist in the present system of the
world: as by indulging that kind of melancholy they decrease the sum
total of public happiness; which is so far rather reprehensible than
commendable. See Plan for Female Education by Dr. Darwin, Johnson,
London, Sect. XVII.</p>

<p>This has been carried to great excess in the East by the disciples of
Confucius; the Gentoos during a famine in India refused to eat the

ascribed their combinations to certain immutable properties received
from the hand of the Creator, such as general gravitation, chemical
affinity, or animal appetency, instead of ascribing them to a blind
chance; the doctrine of atoms, as constituting or composing the
material world by the variety of their combinations, so far from
leading the mind to atheism, would strengthen the demonstration of the
existence of a Deity, as the first cause of all things; because the
analogy resulting from our perpetual experience of cause and effect
would have thus been exemplified through universal nature.<a href="#c4_l147"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<i>The varied landscape</i>, l. 160. The pleasure, we feel on
examining a fine landscape, is derived from various sources; as first
the excitement of the retina of the eye into certain quantities of
action; which when there is in the optic nerve any accumulation of
sensorial power, is always agreeable. 2. When it is excited into such
successive actions, as relieve each other; as when a limb has been
long exerted in one direction, by stretching it in another; as
described in Zoonomia, Sect. XL. 6. on ocular spectra. 3. And lastly
by the associations of its parts with some agreeable sentiments or
tastes, as of sublimity, beauty, utility, novelty; and the objects
suggesting other sentiments, which have lately been termed picturesque
as mentioned in the note to Canto III, l. 230 of this work. The two
former of these sources of pleasure arise from irritation, the last
from association.<a href="#c4_l160"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<i>We drink delighted</i>, l. 178. The pleasure we experience
from music, is, like that from viewing a landscape, derived from
various sources; as first from the excitement of the auditory nerve
into certain quantities of action, when there exists any accumulation
of sensorial power. 2. When the auditory nerve is exerted in such
successive actions as relieve each other, like stretching or yawning,
as described in Botanic Garden, Vol. II, Interlude the third, these
successions of sound are termed melody, and their combinations
harmony. 3. From the repetition of sounds at certain intervals of
time; as we hear them with greater facility and accuracy, when we
expect them; because they are then excited by volition, as well as by
irritation, or at least the tympanum is then better adapted to assist
their production; hence the two musical times or bars; and hence the
rhimes in poetry give pleasure, as well as the measure of the verse:
and lastly the pleasure we receive from music, arises from the
associations of agreeable sentiments with certain proportions, or
repetitions, or quantities, or times of sounds which have been
previously acquired; as explained in Zoonomia Vol. I. Sect. XVI. 10.
and Sect. XXII. 2.<a href="#c4_l178"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto4_l270" name="canto4_l270"></a>
<i>The immortal Press</i>, l. 270. The discovery of the art of
printing has had so great influence on human affairs, that from thence
may be dated a new æra in the history of mankind. As by the diffusion
of general knowledge, both of the arts of taste and of useful
sciences, the public mind has become improved to so great a degree,
that though new impositions have been perpetually produced, the arts
of detecting them have improved with greater rapidity. Hence since the
introduction of printing, superstition has been much lessened by the
reformation of religion; and necromancy, astrology, chiromancy,
witchcraft, and vampyrism, have vanished from all classes of society;
though some are still so weak in the present enlightened times as to
believe in the prodigies of animal magnetism, and of metallic
tractors; by this general diffusion of knowledge, if the liberty of
the press be preserved, mankind will not be liable in this part of the
world to sink into such abject slavery as exists at this day in
China.<a href="#c4_l270"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto4_l294" name="canto4_l294"></a>
<i>Her expressive verb</i>, l. 294. The verb, or the word, has
been so called from its being the most expressive term in all
languages; as it suggests the ideas of existence, action or suffering,
and of time; see the Note on Canto III. <a href="#canto3_l371">l. 371</a>, of this work.<a href="#c4_l294"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto4_l299" name="canto4_l299"></a>
<i>Call'd by thy voice</i>, l. 299. The numerous trains of
associated ideas are divided by Mr. Hume into three classes, which he
has termed contiguity, causation, and resemblance. Nor should we
wonder to find them thus connected together, since it is the business
of our lives to dispose them into these three classes; and we become
valuable to ourselves and our friends as we succeed in it. Those who
have combined an extensive class of ideas by the contiguity of time or
place, are men learned in the history of mankind, and of the sciences
they have cultivated. Those who have connected a great class of ideas
of resemblances, possess the source of the ornaments of poetry and
oratory, and of all rational analogy. While those who have connected
great classes of ideas of causation, are furnished with the powers of
producing effects. These are the men of active wisdom who lead armies
to victory, and kingdoms to prosperity; or discover and improve the
sciences which meliorate and adorn the condition of humanity.<a href="#c4_l299"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto4_l309" name="canto4_l309"></a>
<i>Polish'd wit bestows</i>, l. 309. Mr. Locke defines wit to
consist of an assemblage of ideas, brought together with quickness and
variety, wherein can be found any resemblance or congruity, thereby to
make up pleasant pictures and agreeable visions in the fancy. To which
Mr. Addison adds, that these must occasion surprise as well as
delight; Spectator, Vol. I. No. LXII. See Note on Canto III. <a href="#canto3_l145">l. 145</a>.
and Additional Note, <a href="#notes7_3">VII. 3</a>. Perhaps wit in the extended use of the
word may mean to express all kinds of fine writing, as the word Taste
is applied to all agreeable visible objects, and thus wit may mean
descriptive sublimity, beauty, the pathetic, or ridiculous, but when
used in the confined sense, as by Mr. Locke and Mr. Addison as above,
it may probably be better defined a combination of ideas with
agreeable novelty, as this may be effected by opposition as well as by
resemblance.<a href="#c4_l309"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto4_l339" name="canto4_l339"></a>
<i>The goaded fibre</i>, l. 339. Old age consists in the
inaptitude to motion from the inirritability of the system, and the
consequent want of fibrous contraction; see Additional Note <a href="#notes7">VII</a>.<a href="#c4_l339"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto4_l349" name="canto4_l349"></a>
<i>Ten thousand seeds</i>, l. 349. The fertility of plants in
respect to seeds is often remarkable; from one root in one summer the
seeds of zea, maize, amount to 2000; of inula, elecampane, to 3000; of
helianthus, sunflower, to 4000; of papaver, poppy, 32000; of
nicotiana, tobacco, to 40320; to this must be added the perennial
roots, and the buds. Buds, which are so many herbs, in one tree, the
trunk of which does not exceed a span in thickness, frequently amount
to 10000; Lin. Phil. Bot. p. 86.<a href="#c4_l349"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto4_l351" name="canto4_l351"></a>
<i>The countless Aphides</i>, l. 351. The aphises, pucerons, or
vine-fretters, are hatched from an egg in the early spring, and are
all called females, as they produce a living offspring about once in a
fortnight to the ninth generation, which are also all of them females;
then males are also produced, and by their intercourse the females
become oviparous, and deposite their eggs on the branches, or in the
bark to be hatched in the ensuing spring.</p>

<p>This double mode of reproduction, so exactly resembling the buds and
seeds of trees, accounts for the wonderful increase of this insect,
which, according to Dr. Richardson, consists of ten generations, and
of fifty at an average in each generation; so that the sum of fifty
multiplied by fifty, and that product again multiplied by fifty nine
times, would give the product of one egg only in countless millions;
to which must be added the innumerable eggs laid by the tenth
generation for the renovation of their progeny in the ensuing spring.<a href="#c4_l351"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto4_l352" name="canto4_l352"></a>
<i>The honey'd sap</i>, l. 352. The aphis punctures with its
fine proboscis the sap-vessels of vegetables without any visible
wound, and thus drinks the sap-juice, or vegetable chyle, as it
ascends. Hence on the twigs of trees they stand with their heads
downwards, as I have observed, to acquire this ascending sap-juice
with greater facility. The honey-dew on the upper surface of leaves is
evacuated by these insects, as they hang on the underside of the
leaves above; when they take too much of this saccharine juice during
the vernal or midsummer sap-flow of most vegetables; the black powder
on leaves is also their excrement at other times. The vegetable world
seems to have escaped total destruction from this insect by the number
of flies, which in their larva state prey upon them; and by the
ichneumon fly, which deposits its eggs in them. Some vegetables put
forth stiff bristles with points round their young shoots, as the
moss-rose, apparently to prevent the depredation of these insects, so
injurious to them by robbing them of their chyle or nourishment.<a href="#c4_l352"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto4_l359" name="canto4_l359"></a>
<i>The tadpole swims</i>, l. 359. The progress of a tadpole from
a fish to a quadruped by his gradually putting forth his limbs, and at
length leaving the water, and breathing the dry air, is a subject of
great curiosity, as it resembles so much the incipient state of all
other quadrupeds, and men, who are aquatic animals in the uterus, and
become aerial ones at their birth.<a href="#c4_l359"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto4_l381" name="canto4_l381"></a>
<i>Which buds or breathes</i>, l. 381. Organic bodies, besides
the carbon, hydrogen, azote, and the oxygen and heat, which are
combined with them, require to be also immersed in loose heat and
loose oxygen to preserve their mutable existence; and hence life only
exists on or near the surface of the earth; see Botan. Garden, Vol. I.
Canto IV. l. 419. L'organisation, le sentiment, le movement spontané,
la vie, n'existent qu'à la surface de la terre, et dans les lieux
exposés à la lumière. Traité de Chimie par M. Lavoisier, Tom. I. p.
202.<a href="#c4_l381"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto4_l387" name="canto4_l387"></a>
<i>Born to new life</i>, l. 387. From the innumerable births of
the larger insects, and the spontaneous productions of the microscopic
ones, every part of organic matter from the recrements of dead
vegetable or animal bodies, on or near the surface of the earth,
becomes again presently reanimated; which by increasing the number and
quantity of living organizations, though many of them exist but for a
short time, adds to the sum total of terrestrial happiness.<a href="#c4_l387"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto4_l403" name="canto4_l403"></a>
<i>Thus sainted Paul</i>, l. 403. The doctrine of St. Paul
teaches the resurrection of the body in an incorruptible and glorified
state, with consciousness of its previous existence; he therefore
justly exults over the sting of death, and the victory of the grave.<a href="#c4_l403"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto4_l410" name="canto4_l410"></a>
<i>And lights the dawn</i>, l. 410. The sum total of the
happiness of organized nature is probably increased rather than
diminished, when one large old animal dies, and is converted into many
thousand young ones; which are produced or supported with their
numerous progeny by the same organic matter. Linneus asserts, that
three of the flies, called musca vomitoria, will consume the body of a
dead horse, as soon as a lion can; Syst. Nat.<a href="#c4_l410"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto4_l411" name="canto4_l411"></a>
<i>So when Arabia's bird</i>, l. 411. The story of the Ph&oelig;nix
rising from its own ashes with a star upon its head seems to have been
an hieroglyphic emblem of the destruction and resuscitation of all
things; see Botan. Garden, Vol. I. Canto IV. l. 389.<a href="#c4_l411"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto4_l417" name="canto4_l417"></a>
<i>So erst the Sage</i>, l. 417. It is probable, that the
perpetual transmigration of matter from one body to another, of all
vegetables and animals, during their lives, as well as after their
deaths, was observed by Pythagoras; which he afterwards applied to the
soul, or spirit of animation, and taught, that it passed from one
animal to another as a punishment for evil deeds, though without
consciousness of its previous existence; and from this doctrine he
inculcated a system of morality and benevolence, as all creatures thus
became related to each other.<a href="#c4_l417"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto4_l431" name="canto4_l431"></a>
<i>The marble mountain</i>, l. 431. From the increased knowledge
in Geology during the present century, owing to the greater attention
of philosophers to the situations of the different materials, which
compose the strata of the earth, as well as to their chemical
properties, it seems clearly to appear, that the nucleus of the globe
beneath the ocean consisted of granite; and that on this the great
beds of limestone were formed from the shells of marine animals during
the innumerable primeval ages of the world; and that whatever strata
lie on these beds of limestone, or on the granite, where the limestone
does not cover it, were formed after the elevation of islands and
continents above the surface of the sea by the recrements of
vegetables and of terrestrial animals; see on this subject Botanic
Garden, Vol. I. Additional Note XXIV.<a href="#c4_l431"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto4_l450" name="canto4_l450"></a>
<i>Are mighty monuments</i>, l. 450. The reader is referred to a
few pages on this subject in Phytologia, Sect. XIX. 7. 1, where the
felicity of organic life is considered more at large; but it is
probable that the most certain way to estimate the happiness and
misery of organic beings; as it depends on the actions of the organs
of sense, which constitute ideas; or of the muscular fibres which
perform locomotion; would be to consider those actions, as they are
produced or excited by the four sensorial powers of irritation,
sensation, volition, and association. A small volume on this subject
by some ingenious writer, might not only amuse, as an object of
curiosity; but by showing the world the immediate sources of their
pains and pleasures might teach the means to avoid the one, and to
procure the other, and thus contribute both ways to increase the sum
total of organic happiness.<a href="#c4_l450"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

<p class="p2"><a id="canto4_l453" name="canto4_l453"></a>
<i>How Life increasing</i>, l. 453. Not only the vast calcareous
provinces, which form so great a part of the terraqueous globe, and
also whatever rests upon them, as clay, marl, sand, and coal, were
formed from the fluid elements of heat, oxygen, azote, and hydrogen
along with carbon, phosphorus, and perhaps a few other substances,
which the science of chemistry has not yet decomposed; and gave the
pleasure of life to the animals and vegetables, which formed them; and
thus constitute monuments of the past happiness of those organized
beings. But as those remains of former life are not again totally
decomposed, or converted into their original elements, they supply
more copious food to the succession of new animal or vegetable beings
on their surface; which consists of materials convertible into
nutriment with less labour or activity of the digestive powers; and
hence the quantity or number of organized bodies, and their
improvement in size, as well as their happiness, has been continually
increasing, along with the solid parts of the globe; and will probably
continue to increase, till the whole terraqueous sphere, and all that
inhabit it shall dissolve by a general conflagration, and be again
reduced to their elements.</p>

<p>Thus all the suns, and the planets, which circle round them, may again
sink into one central chaos; and may again by explosions produce a new
world; which in process of time may resemble the present one, and at
length again undergo the same catastrophe! these great events may be
the result of the immutable laws impressed on matter by the Great
Cause of Causes, Parent of Parents, Ens Entium!<a href="#c4_l453"><span class="small">[Back to Canto]</span></a></p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
