                  <head>PREFACE</head>


                  <p>In the continuation of the <bibl>Arabian Tales</bibl>, the
                        <orgName>Domdaniel</orgName> is mentioned; a Seminary for evil Magicians <rs
                        type="metaplace" subtype="under" ref="Under_Ocean">under the Roots of the
                        Sea</rs>. From this seed the present Romance has grown. Let me not be
                     supposed to prefer the metre in which it is written, abstractedly considered,
                     to the regular blank verse; the noblest measure, in my judgement, of which our
                     admirable language is capable. For the following Poem I have preferred it,
                     because it suits the varied subject; it is the <hi rend="italic">Arabesque</hi>
                     ornament of an Arabian tale.</p>

                  <p>The <bibl>dramatic sketches of <author>
                           <persName>Dr. Sayer</persName>
                        </author>
                     </bibl>, a volume which no lover of poetry will recollect without pleasure,
                     induced me when a young versifier, to practise in this metre. I felt that while
                     it gave the poet a wider range of expression, it satisfied the ear of the
                     reader. It were easy to make a parade of learning by enumerating the various
                     feet which it admits; it is only needful to observe that no two lines are
                     employed in <hi rend="italic">sequence</hi> which can be read into one. Two
                     six-syllable lines (it will perhaps be answered) compose an Alexandrine: the
                     truth is that the Alexandrine, when harmonious, is composed of two six-syllable
                     lines.</p>

                  <p>One advantage this metre assuredly possesses; the dullest reader cannot distort
                     it into discord: he may read it with a <hi rend="italic">prose mouth</hi>, but
                     its flow and fall will still be perceptible. Verse is not enough favoured by
                     the English reader: perhaps this is owing to the obtrusiveness, the regular
                     Jews-harp <hi rend="italic">twing-twang</hi>, of what has been foolishly called
                     heroic measure. I do not wish the <hi rend="italic">improvisatorè</hi> tune,
                     but something that denotes the sense of harmony, something like the accent of
                     feeling; like the tone which every Poet necessarily gives to Poetry.</p>

                                 no soil nor spot. Certain shape it had none, for its figure was
                                 inconstant and momentarily changing, and tho' at a distance it was
                                 beautiful to the eye, it would not suffer itself to be handled with
                                 impunity, but hurt those who obstinately struggled with it, as many
                                 persons before many spectators experienced. If by chance any part
                                 of it was broken off, for it was not very hard, it become nothing

                              <p> 'Tis the custom of <placeName>Persia</placeName> to begin their
                                 feasts with fruits and preserves. We spent two hours in eating only
                                 those and drinking beer, hydromel and aquavitæ. Then was brought up
                                 the meat in great silver dishes, they were full of rice of divers
                                 colours, and upon that, several sorts of meat boild and roasted, as
                                 beef, mutton, tame fowl, wild ducks, fish and other things, all
                                 very well ordered and very delicate. </p>

                                 <orgName>The Persians</orgName> use no knives at table, but the
                                 Cooks send up the meat ready cut up into little bits, so that it
                                 was no trouble to us to accustome ourselves to their manner of
                                 eating. Rice serves them instead of bread. They take a mouthful of
                                 it, with the two fore-fingers and the thumb, and so put it into
                                 their mouths. Every table had a carver, whom they call Suffret-zi,
                                 who takes the meat brought up in the great dishes, to put it into
                                 lesser ones, which he fills with 3 or 4 sorts of meat, so as that
                                 every dish may serve 2 or at most 3 persons. There was but little
                                 drunk till towards the end of the repast, and then the cups went
                                 about roundly, and the dinner was concluded with a vessel of
                                 porcelane, full of a hot blackish kind of drink, which they call
                                 Kahawa. <bibl>Ambassadors Travels.</bibl>

                                 after that cloth was taken away that another might be laid in the
                                 room of it, and upon this was set rice of all sorts of colours and

                                 all their dishes. They sometimes put thereto a little of the juice
                                 of pomegranates or cherries and saffron, insomuch that commonly you

                                 and serve for feeding Camels. But the proper melons are planted in
                                 the fields, where a great variety of them is to be found, and in
                                 such abundance, that <orgName>the Arabians</orgName> of all ranks

                                 ripe, a hole is pierced into the pulp, this hole is then stopped

                                    very few among them know what a watch is, and as they conceive,
                                    but imperfectly the duration of an hour, they usually determine
                                    time almost as when we say, it happened about noon, about
                                    evening, &amp;c. The moment when the Sun disappears is called
                                       <hi rend="italic">Maggrib</hi>, about two hours afterwards
                                    they call it <hi rend="italic">El ascha</hi>; two hours later,
                                       <hi rend="italic">El märfa</hi>; midnight <hi rend="italic"
                                       >Nus el lejl</hi>: the dawn of morning <hi rend="italic">El
                                       fadsjer</hi>: sun rise <hi rend="italic">Es subhh</hi>. They
                                    eat about nine in the morning, and that meal is called <hi
                                       rend="italic">El ghadda</hi>; noon <hi rend="italic">El
                                       duhhr</hi>; three hours after noon <hi rend="italic">El
                                       asr</hi>. Of all these divisions of time only noon and
                                    midnight are well ascertained; they both fall upon the twelfth
                                    hour. The others are earlier or later as the days are short or
                                    long. The five hours appointed for prayer are <hi rend="italic"
                                       >Maggrib, Nus el lejl, El fedsjer, Duhhr</hi>, and <hi
                                       rend="italic">El asr</hi>.</time>

                                 creature that happens to be within the sphere of its activity, and
                                 immediate putrefaction of the carcases of the dead. The Arabians
                                 discern its approach by an unusual redness in the air, and they say
                                 that they feel a smell of sulphur as it passes. The only means by
                                 which any person can preserve himself from suffering by these
                                 noxious blasts, is by throwing himself down with his face upon the
                                 earth, till this whirlwind of poisonous exhalations has blown over,
                                 which always moves at a certain height in the atmosphere. Instinct
                                 even teaches the brutes to incline their heads to the ground on

                              <p> Their heat is sometimes so excessive that it is difficult to form
                                 any idea of its violence without having experienced it; but it may
                                 be compared to the heat of a large oven at the moment of drawing
                                 out the bread. When these winds begin to blow, the atmosphere
                                 assumes an alarming aspect. The sky at other times so clear, in
                                 this climate, becomes dark and heavy; the sun loses his splendour
                                 and appears of a violet colour. The air is not cloudy, but grey and
                                 thick, and is in fact filled with an extremely subtile dust, which
                                 penetrates every where. This wind, always light and rapid, is not
                                 at first remarkably hot, but it increases in heat in proportion as
                                 it continues. All animated bodies soon discover it, by the change
                                 it produces in them. The lungs which a too rarefied air no longer
                                 expands, are contracted and become painful. Respiration is short
                                 and difficult, the skin parched and dry, and the body consumed by
                                 an internal heat. In vain is recourse had to large draughts of
                                 water; nothing can restore perspiration. In vain is coolness sought
                                 for; all bodies in which it is usual to find it, deceives the hand
                                 that touches them. <rs type="science" subtype="phys">Marble, iron,
                                    water, notwithstanding the sun no longer appears, are hot.</rs>
                                 The streets are deserted, and the dead silence of night reigns
                                 every where. <orgName>The inhabitants of houses and
                                    villages</orgName> shut themselves up in their houses, and those
                                 of <rs type="place" ref="desert">the desert</rs> in their tents, or
                                 in <rs type="earthworks" subtype="mine">pits they dig in the
                                    earth</rs>, where they wait the termination of this destructive
                                 heat. It usually <time>lasts three days</time>, but if it exceeds
                                 that time it becomes insupportable. Woe to <rs type="person">the
                                    traveller</rs> whom this wind surprizes remote from shelter! he
                                 must suffer all its dreadful consequences which sometimes are
                                 mortal. The danger is most imminent when it blows in squalls, for
                                 then the rapidity of the wind increases the heat to such degree as
                                 to cause sudden death. This death is a real suffocation; the lungs
                                 being empty, are convulsed, the circulation disordered, and the
                                 whole mass of blood driven by the heart towards the head and
                                 breast; whence that hæmorrhage at the nose and mouth which happens
                                 after death. This wind is especially fatal to <orgName>persons of a
                                    plethoric habit</orgName>, and those in whom fatigue has
                                 destroyed the tone of the muscles and the vessels. The corpse
                                 remains a long time warm, swells, turns blue and is easily
                                 separated; all which are signs of that putrid fermentation which
                                 takes place in animal bodies when the humours become stagnant.
                                 These accidents are to be avoided by stopping the nose and mouth
                                 with handkerchiefs; an efficacious method likewise is that
                                 practised by the camels, who bury their noses in the sand and keep
                                 them there till the squall is over. </p>
                              <p> Another quality of this wind is its extreme aridity; which is
                                 such, that water sprinkled on the floor evaporates in a few
                                 minutes. By this extreme dryness it withers and strips all the
                                 plants, and by exhaling too suddenly the emanations from animal
                                 bodies, crisps the skin, closes the pores, and causes that feverish
                                 heat which is the invariable effect of suppressed perspiration. <bibl>

                                    stone of a christalline colour, a little darkish, somewhat
                                    resembling limpid water; and sometimes it has veins of the
                                    colour of flesh. Some call it <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Gallinaceus</hi>, from the place of its generation, the
                                    intestines of capons, which were castrated at three years old,
                                    and had lived seven, before which time the stone ought not to be
                                    taken out, for the older it is, so much the better. When the
                                    stone is become perfect in the Capon, he do'nt drink. However
                                    tis never found bigger than a large bean. The virtue of this
                                    stone is to render him who carries it invisible, being held in
                                    the mouth it allays thirst, and therefore is proper for
                                    wrestlers; makes a woman agreable to her husband; bestows honors
                                    and preserves those already acquired; it frees such as are

                                    amiable; it helps to regain a lost Kingdom, and acquire a
                                    foreign one.</rs>

                              <p> Giafar, the founder of the Barmecides, being obliged to fly from
                                    <placeName>Persia</placeName> his native country, took refuge at
                                    <placeName>Damascus</placeName>, and implored the protection of
                                 the Caliph Soliman. When he was presented to that Prince, the
                                 Caliph suddenly changed colour and commanded him to retire,
                                 suspecting that he had poison about him. Soliman had discovered it
                                 by means of ten stones which he wore upon his arm. They were
                                 fastened there like a bracelet, and never failed to strike one
                                 against the other and make a slight noise when any poison was near.
                                 Upon enquiry it was found that Giafar carried poison in his ring,
                                 for the purpose of self-destruction in case he had been taken by
                                 his enemies. <bibl>Marigny.</bibl>

                                    canes called Cassan, which overspread the earth like glasse, and
                                    out of every knot of them spring foorth certaine branches, which
                                    are continued upon the ground almost for the space of a mile.

                                       therefore the men of that country for the most part carry

                                       be launced, putting one of the said stones into the wound,
                                       healing also, and closing up the said wound with the powder
                                       of a certain fish (the name whereof I do not know) which
                                       powder doth immediately consolidate and cure the said wound.

                                    against them: namely, they provide themselves armour of yron or
                                    steele against their arrowes, and weapons also poisoned with the
                                    poyson of trees, and they carry in their hands wooden stakes
                                    most sharp and hard-pointed, as if they were yron: likewise they
                                    shoot arrowes without yron heades, and so they confound and slay
                                    some of their unarmed foes trusting too securely unto the vertue
                                    of their stones.</rs>

                              <p> It happened the dead corps of a man was cast ashore at
                                    <placeName>Chatham</placeName>, and being taken up was buried
                                 decently in the Church yard; now there was an image or rood in the
                                 Church called our Lady of Chatham, this Lady, say the Monks, went
                                 the next night and roused up the Clerk, telling him that a sinful
                                 person was buried near the place where she was worshipped, who
                                 offended her eyes with his ghastly grinning, and unless he were
                                 removed, to the great grief of good people she must remove from
                                 thence and could work no more miracles. Therefore she desired him
                                 to go with her to take him up, and throw him into the river again:
                                 which being done, soon after the body floated again, and was taken
                                 up and <rs type="metaplace" subtype="under" ref="Tombs">buried in
                                    the Church yard</rs>; but from that time all miracles ceased,
                                 and the place where he was buried did continually sink downwards.
                                 This tale is still remembered by some aged people, receiving it by
                                 tradition from the popish times of darkness and idolatry.

                                 When peace was made, about the year 1170, between the Earls of
                                    <placeName>Holland</placeName>, and
                                    <placeName>Flanders</placeName>, "it was concluded that Count
                                 Floris should send unto Count Philip, a thousand men, expert in
                                 making of ditches, to stop the hole which had beene made neere unto
                                 Dam, or the Sluce, whereby the countrey was drowned round about at
                                 everie high sea; the which the Flemings could by no meanes fil up,
                                 neither with wood, nor any other matter, for that all sunke as in a
                                 gulfe without any bottome; whereby, in succession of time,
                                    <placeName>Bruges</placeName> and all that jurisdiction, had
                                 been in danger to have bin lost by inundation, and to become all
                                 sea, if it were not speedily repaired. Count Floris having taken
                                 possession of the isle of Walchran, returned into
                                    <placeName>Holland</placeName>, from whence hee sent the best
                                 workmen he could find in all his countries, into
                                    <placeName>Flanders</placeName>, to make dikes and causeies, and
                                 to stop the hole neere unto this Dam, or Sluce, and to recover the
                                 drowned land. These diggers being come to the place, they found at
                                 the entrie of this bottomlesse hole a Sea-dog, the which for six
                                 dayes together, did nothing but crie out and howle very fearefully.
                                 They, not knowing what it might signifie, having consulted of this
                                 accident, they resolved to cast this dogge into the hole. There was
                                 a mad-headed Hollander among the rest, who going into the bottome
                                 of the dike, tooke the dogge by the taile, and cast him into the
                                 middest of the gulfe; then speedily they cast earth and torfe into
                                 it, so as they found a bottome, and by little and little filled it
                                 up. And for that many workemen came to the repairing of this dike,
                                 who for that they would not be far from their worke, coucht in
                                 Cabines, which seemed to be a pretie towne. Count Philip gave unto
                                 all these Hollanders, Zeelanders and others, that would inhabit
                                 there, as much land as they could recover from
                                    <placeName>Dam</placeName> to <placeName>Ardenbourg</placeName>,
                                 for them and their successors, for ever, with many other immunities
                                 and freedoms. By reason whereof many planted themselves there, and
                                 in succession of time, made a good towne there, the which by reason
                                 of this dog, which they cast into the hole, they named <hi

                              <p> The simplicity, or, perhaps, more properly, the poverty, of the
                                 lower class of the <orgName>Bedouins</orgName>, is proportionate to
                                 that of their chiefs. All the wealth of a family consists of
                                 moveables, of which the following is a pretty exact inventory. A
                                 few male and female camels, some goats and poultry, a mare and her
                                 bridle and saddle, a tent, a lance sixteen feet long, a crooked
                                 sabre, a rusty musket, with a flint or matchlock; a pipe, a
                                 portable mill, a pot for cooking, a leathern bucket, a small coffee
                                 roaster, a mat, some clothes, a mantle of black woollen, and a few
                                 glass or silver rings, which the women wear upon their legs and
                                 arms; if none of these are wanting, their furniture is complete.
                                 But what the poor man stands most in need of, and what he takes
                                 most pleasure in, is his mare; for this animal is his principal
                                 support. With his mare the Bedouin makes his excursions against
                                 hostile tribes, or seeks plunder in the country, and on the
                                 highways. The mare is preferred to the horse, because she does not
                                 neigh, is more docile, and yields milk, which on occasion,
                                 satisfies the thirst and even the hunger of her master.

                              <p> The Shaik, says Volney, with whom I resided in the country of
                                    <placeName>Gaza</placeName>, about the end of <date>1784</date>,
                                 passed for one of the most powerful of those districts; yet it did
                                 not appear to me that his expenditure was greater than that of an
                                 opulent farmer. His personal effects, consisting in a few pelisses,
                                 carpets, arms, horses, and camels, could not be estimated at more
                                 than fifty thousand livres (a little above two thousand pounds);
                                 and it must be observed that in this calculation four mares of the
                                 breed of racers are valued at six thousand livres, (two hundred and
                                 fifty pounds), and each camel at ten pounds sterling. We must not
                                 therefore, when we speak of the <orgName>Bedouins</orgName>, affix
                                 to the words Prince and Lord, the ideas they usually convey; we
                                 should come nearer the truth by comparing them to substantial
                                 farmers, in mountainous countries, whose simplicity they resemble
                                 in their dress as well as in their domestic life and manners. A
                                 Shaik, who has the command of five hundred horse, does not disdain
                                 to saddle and bridle his own, nor to give him his barley and
                                 chopped straw. In his tent, his wife makes the coffee, kneeds the
                                 dough, and superintends the dressing of the victuals. His daughters
                                 and kinswomen wash the linen, and go with pitchers on their heads,
                                 and veils over their faces, to draw water from the fountain. These
                                 manners agree precisely with the descriptions in
                                 <bibl>Homer</bibl>, and the history of
                                 <persName>Abraham</persName>, in <bibl>Genesis</bibl>. But it must
                                 be owned that it is difficult to form a just idea of them without
                                 having ourselves been eye witnesses. <bibl>Volney.</bibl>

                                    between two and three feet high, having a hole at the bottom,
                                    for the convenience of drawing out the ashes, something similar
                                    to that of a lime kiln. The oven (which I think is the most
                                    proper name for this place) is usually about fifteen inches wide
                                    at the top, and gradually grows wider to the bottom. It is
                                    heated with wood, and when sufficiently hot, and perfectly clear
                                    from smoke, having nothing but clear embers at bottom (which
                                    continue to reflect great heat), they prepare the dough in a
                                    large bowl, and mould the cakes to the desired size on a board
                                    or stone placed near the oven. After they have kneaded the cake
                                    to a proper consistence, they pat it a little, then toss it
                                    about with great dexterity in one hand, till it is as thin as
                                    they choose to make it. They then wet one side of it with water,
                                    at the same time wetting the hand and arm, with which they put
                                    it into the oven. The wet side of the cake adheres fast to the
                                    side of the oven till it is sufficiently baked when if not paid
                                    sufficient attention to, it would fall down among the embers. If
                                    they were not exceedingly quick at this work, the heat of the
                                    oven would burn the skin from off their hands and arms; but with
                                    such amazing dexterity do they perform it, that one woman will
                                    continue keeping three or four cakes at a time in the oven till
                                    she has done baking. This mode, let me add, does not require
                                    half the fuel that is made use of in

                                    full of branches whereof the leaves are not bigger than, nor
                                    unlike to the leaves of pimpernel, only something longer. The
                                    flower at first is like the peaches, but at last turns white,
                                    and puts forth its fruit at the end of certain strings: as soon
                                    as the sun is set, the leaves close up the fruit, to preserve it
                                    from the dew, and open as soon as that luminary appears again.
                                    The fruit at first is green, but ripening it becomes of a dark
                                    grey, drawing towards a red, inclosed in husks, brown or twany,
                                    of taste a little bitter, like our prunelloes. The tree is as
                                    big as a walnut-tree, full of leaves, bearing its fruit at the
                                    branches, like the sheath of a knife, but not so straight,
                                    rather bent like a bow.</rs>

                                    comprehended. When several instruments are played at once and
                                    accompanied by the voice, you hear them all render the same
                                    melody, unless some one mingles a running base, either singing
                                    or playing, always in the same key. If this music is not greatly

                                    pronounce Mesg jid, are built exactly in the fashion of our
                                    Churches, where instead of such Seats and Benches as we make use
                                    of, they only strew the Floor with Mats, upon which they perform
                                    the several sittings and prostrations that are enjoyned in their
                                    religion. Near the middle, particularly of the principal Mosque
                                    of each city, there is a large pulpit erected, which is
                                    ballustraded round, with about half a dozen steps leading up to
                                    it.</rs> Upon these (for I am told none are permitted to enter
                                 the pulpit) the Mufty or one of the <orgName>Im-ams</orgName>
                                 placeth himself every Friday, the day of the congregation, as they
                                 call it, and from thence either explaineth some part or other of
                                 the <bibl>Coran</bibl>, or else exhorteth the people to piety and
                                 good works. That end of these Mosques, which regards
                                    <placeName>Mecca</placeName>, whither they direct themselves
                                 throughout the whole course of their devotions, is called the
                                 Kiblah, in which there is commonly a nich, representing as a
                                 judicious writer conjectures, the presence, and at the same time
                                 the invisibility of the <name type="divin">Deity</name>. There is
                                 usually a square tower erected at the other end, with a flag-staff
                                 upon the top of it. Hither the cryer ascends at the appointed
                                 times, and displaying a small flag, advertised the people with a
                                 loud voice, from each side of the battlements, of the hour of
                                 prayer. These places of the <orgName>Mahometan</orgName> worship,
                                 together with the Mufty, Im-ams and other persons belonging to
                                 them, are maintained out of certain revenues arising from the rents
                                 of lands and houses, either left by will or set apart by the public

                                    nearly in the same style. They are of an oblong square form, and
                                    covered in the middle with a large dome, on the top of which is
                                    fixed a gilt crescent. In front there is a handsome portico
                                    covered with several small cupolas, and raised one step above
                                    the pavement of the court. The Turks sometimes in the hot
                                    season, perform their devotions there; and between the columns,
                                    upon cross iron bars, are suspended a number of lamps, for
                                    illuminations on the Thursday nights and on all festivals. The
                                    entrance into the Mosque is by one large door. All these
                                    edifices are solidly built of freestone, and in several the
                                    domes are covered with lead. The minarets stand on one side
                                    adjoining to the body of the Mosque. They are sometimes square,
                                    but more commonly round and taper, the gallery for the maazeen,
                                    or cryers, projecting a little from the column near the top, has
                                    some resemblance to a rude capital; and from this the spire
                                    tapering more in proportion than before, soon terminates in a
                                    point crowned with a crescent.</rs>

                                 with what <orgName>the Antients</orgName> called <rs
                                    type="building" subtype="tent">Mapalia, which being then, as
                                    they are to this day, secured from the heat and inclemency of
                                    the weather, by a covering only of such hair cloth, as our coal
                                    sacks are made of, might very justly be described by
                                       <persName>Virgil</persName> to have thin roofs. When we find
                                    any number of them together (and I have seen from 3 to 300) then
                                    they are usually placed in a circle, and constitute a Dou-war.
                                    The fashion of each tent is the same, being of an oblong figure,
                                    not unlike the bottom of a ship turned upside down, as Satlust
                                    hath long ago described them. However they differ in bigness,
                                    according to the number of people who live in them: and are
                                    accordingly supported, some with one pillar, others with two or
                                    three: whilst a curtain or carpet placed, upon occasion, at each
                                    of these divisions, separateth the whole into so many
                                    apartments. The pillar which I have mentioned, is a straight
                                    pole, 8 or 10 feet high and 3 or 4 inches in thickness, serving,
                                    not only to support the tent, but being full of hooks fixd there
                                    for the purpose, the Arabs hang upon it their cloaths, baskets,
                                    saddles, and accoutrements of war. Holofernes, as we read in
                                       <title>Judith, 13. 16</title>. made the like use of the
                                    pillar of his tent, by hanging his fauchin upon it, it is there
                                    called the <hi rend="italic">pillar of the bed</hi>, from the
                                    custom perhaps, that hath always prevailed, of having the upper
                                    end of the carpet, matrass, or whatever else they lie upon,
                                    turned from the skirts of the tent that way. But the Κωνωπειον,
                                    Canopy as we render it (ver. 9) should I presume, be rather
                                    called the gnat or muskeeta net, which is a close curtain of
                                    gauze or fine linnen, used all over <placeName ref="Levant">the
                                       Levant</placeName>, by people of better fashion, to keep out
                                    the flies. The Arabs have nothing of this kind; who in taking
                                    their rest, lie horizontally upon the ground, without bed,
                                    matrass or pillow, wrapping themselves up only in their <hi
                                       rend="italic">Hykes</hi>, and lying, as they find room upon a
                                    mat or carpet, in the middle or corner of the tent. Those who
                                    are married, have each of them a corner of the tent, cantoned
                                    off with a curtain.</rs>

                              <p> The tents of <orgName>the Moors</orgName> are somewhat of a conic
                                 form, are seldom more than 8 or 10 feet high in the centre, and
                                 from 20 to 25 in length. Like those of the remotest antiquity,
                                 their figure is that of a ship overset, the keel of which is only
                                 seen. These tents are made of twine, composed of goat's hair,
                                 camel's wool, and the leaves of the wild palm, so that they keep
                                 out water; but, being black, they produce a disagreable effect at a
                                 distant view. <bibl>Chenier.</bibl>

                              <p> The music of the <orgName>Bedoweens</orgName> rarely consists of
                                 more than one strain, suitable to their homely instruments, and to
                                 their simple invention. The Arabebbah as they call the bladder and
                                 string, is in the highest vogue, and doubtless of great antiquity,
                                 as is also the Gaspah, which is only a common reed, open at each
                                 end, having the side of it bored, with three or more holes,
                                 according to the ability of the Person who is to touch it: tho' the
                                 compass of their tunes rarely or ever exceeds an octave. Yet
                                 sometimes, even in this simplicity of harmony, they observe
                                 something of method and ceremony, for in their historical <hi
                                    rend="italic">Cantatas</hi> especially, they have their preludes
                                 and symphonies; each stanza being introduced with a flourish from
                                 the Arabebbah, while the narration itself is accompanied with the
                                 softest touches they are able to make, upon the Gaspah. The Tarr,
                                 another of their instruments, is made like a Sive, consisting (as
                                 Isidore describeth the Tympanum) of a thin rim or hoop of wood,
                                 with a skin of parchment stretched over the top of it. This serves
                                 for the Bass in all their Concerts, which they accordingly touch
                                 very artfully with their fingers, and the knuckles or palms of
                                 their hands, as the time and measure require, or as force and
                                 softness are to be communicated to the several parts of the
                                 performance. The Tarr is undoubtedly the Tympanum of the Antients,
                                 which appears as well from the general use of it all over
                                    <placeName>Barbary</placeName>, <placeName>Egypt</placeName> and
                                    <placeName ref="Levant">the Levant</placeName>, as from the
                                 method of playing upon it, and the figure of the instrument itself,
                                 being exactly of the same fashion, with what we find in the hands
                                 of Cybele and the Bacchanals among the Basso Relievos and Statues

                              <p> It seems the <orgName>Arabs</orgName> are still great rhymers, and
                                 their verses are sometimes rewarded, but I should not venture to
                                 say that there are great Poets among them. Yet I was assured in
                                    <placeName>Yemen</placeName> that it is not uncommon to find
                                 them among the wandering Arabs in <placeName ref="Dsjâf">the
                                    country of Dsjâf</placeName>. It is some few years since a Sheik
                                 of these Arabs was in prison at <placeName>Sana</placeName>: seeing
                                 by chance a bird upon a roof opposite to him, he recollected that
                                 the devout <orgName>Mohammedans</orgName> believe they perform an
                                 action agreable to<name type="divin">God</name>in giving liberty to
                                 a bird encaged. He thought therefore he had as much right to
                                 liberty as a bird, and made a poem upon the subject, which was
                                 first learnt by his guards, and then became so popular that at last
                                 it reached the Imam. He was so pleased with it that he liberated
                                 the Sheik, whom he had arrested for his robberies. <bibl>Niebuhr.

                                 Their airs, in point of character and execution, resemble nothing
                                 we have heard in <placeName>Europe</placeName>, except the

                                 inflections of tone impossible to be imitated by European throats.
                                 Their performance is accompanied with sighs and gestures, which
                                 paint the passions in a more lively manner than we snould venture
                                 to allow. They may be said to excell most in the melancholy strain.
                                 To behold an Arab with his head inclined, his hand applied to his
                                 ear, his eye brows knit, his eyes languishing; to hear his
                                 plaintive tones, his lengthened notes, his sighs and sobs, it is
                                 almost impossible to refrain from tears, which as their expression
                                 is, are far from bitter: and indeed they must certainly find a
                                 pleasure in shedding them, since among all their songs, they
                                 constantly prefer that which excites them most, as among all
                                 accomplishments singing is that they most admire.

                                 have a peculiar passion for such stories: and employ in them almost
                                 all their leisure, of which they have a great deal. In the evening
                                 they seat themselves on the ground at the door of their tents, or
                                 under cover if it be cold, and there, ranged in a circle, round a
                                 little fire of dung, their pipes in their mouths, and their legs
                                 crossed, they sit awhile in silent meditation, till, on a sudden,

                                 relates in what manner the youth first got a secret glimpse of his
                                 mistress, and how he became desperately enamoured of her: he
                                 minutely describes the lovely fair, extols her black eyes, as large
                                 and soft as those of the gazelle; her languid and empassioned
                                 looks; her arched eye brows, resembling two bows of ebony; her
                                 waist, straight and supple as a lance; he forgets not her steps,
                                 light as those of the <hi rend="italic">young filley</hi>, nor her
                                 eye-lashes blackened with <hi rend="italic">kohl</hi>, nor her lips
                                 painted blue, nor her nails, tinged with the golden coloured <hi

                                 pomegranates, nor her words, sweet as honey. He recounts the

                                    desire and passion, that his body no longer yields any

                                 see his mistress, the obstacles on the part of the parents, the

                                 the efficacy of their looks only; and therefore when one has

                                 cry, and the other never stirs during its absence, but remains with
                                 its eyes fixed upon the eggs, till the return of its mate, and then
                                 goes in its turn to look for food, and this care of theirs is so

                                 most destructive; as they fly, they yield to the current of the
                                 wind which hurries them into the sea, or into <rs type="place"
                                    ref="desert">sandy deserts</rs> where they perish with hunger or
                                 fatigue. The young locusts, that cannot fly, are the most ruinous;
                                 they are about fifteen lines in length; and the thickness of a
                                 goose quill. They creep over the country in such multitudes that

                                 feeding announces their approach at some distance. The devastations

                                 was ravaged by these insects. In the summer of that year, such
                                 clouds of locusts came from the south that they darkened the air,
                                 and devoured a part of the harvest. Their offspring, which they
                                 left on the ground, committed still much greater mischief. Locusts
                                 appeared and bred anew in the following year, so that in the spring
                                 the country was wholly covered, and they crawled one over the other
                                 in search of their subsistence. </p>
                              <p> It has been remarked, in speaking of the climate of
                                    <placeName>Morocco</placeName>, that the young locusts are those
                                 which are the most mischievous; and that it seems almost impossible
                                 to rid the land of these insects and their ravages, when the
                                 country once becomes thus afflicted. In order to preserve the
                                 houses and gardens in the neighbourhood of cities, they dig a ditch
                                 two feet in depth and as much in width. This they pallisade with
                                 reeds close to each other, and inclined inward toward the ditch; so
                                 that the insects unable to climb up the slippery reed, fall back
                                 into the ditch, where they devour one another. </p>
                              <p> This was the means by which the gardens and vineyards of
                                    <placeName>Rabat</placeName>, and the city itself were delivered
                                 from this scourge, in 1779. The intrenchment, which was, at least,
                                 a league in extent, formed a semicircle from the sea to river,
                                 which separates Rabat from Sallee. The quantity of young locusts
                                 here assembled was so prodigious that, on the third day, the ditch
                                 could not be approached because of the stench. The whole country
                                 was eaten up, the very bark of the fig, pomegranate, and orange
                                 tree, bitter, hard, and corrosive as it was could not escape the
                                 voracity of these insects. </p>
                              <p> The lands, ravaged throughout all the western provinces, produced
                                 no harvest, and the <orgName>Moors</orgName> being obliged to live
                                 on their stores, which the exportation of corn (permitted till
                                    <date>1774</date>) had drained, began to feel a dearth. Their
                                 cattle, for which they make no provision, and which in these
                                 climates, have no other subsistance than that of daily grazing,
                                 died with hunger; nor could any be preserved but those which were
                                 in the neighbourhood of mountains, or in marshy grounds, where the
                                 regrowth of pasturage is more rapid. </p>
                              <p> In <date>1780</date>, the distress was still farther increased.
                                 The dry winter had checked the products of the earth, and given
                                 birth to a new generation of locusts, who devoured whatever had
                                 escaped from the inclemency of the season. The husbandman did not
                                 reap even what he had sowed, and found himself destitute of food,
                                 cattle, or seed corn. In this time of extreme wretchedness the poor
                                 felt all the horrors of famine. They were seen wandering over the
                                 country to devour roots, and, perhaps, abridged their days by
                                 digging into the entrails of the earth in search of the crude means
                                 by which they might be preserved. </p>
                              <p> Vast numbers perished of indigestible food and want. I have beheld
                                 country people in the roads, and in the streets, who had died of
                                 hunger, and who were thrown across asses to be taken and buried.
                                 Fathers sold their children. The husband, with the consent of his
                                 wife, would take her into another province, there to bestow her in
                                 marriage as if she were his sister, and afterwards come and reclaim
                                 her when his wants were no longer so great. I have seen women and
                                 children run after camels, and rake in their dung to seek for some
                                 indigested grain of barley, which, if they found, they devoured
                                 with avidity. <bibl>Chenier.</bibl>

                              <p> The Abmelec or eater of Locusts, or grasshoppers, is a bird which
                                 better deserves to be described, perhaps, than most others of which
                                 travellers have given us an account, because the facts relating to
                                 it are not only strange, in themselves, but so well and distinctly
                                 attested, that however surprising they may seem, we cannot but
                                 afford them our belief. The food of this creature is the locust, or
                                 the grasshopper: it is of the size of an ordinary hen, its feathers
                                 black, its wings large, and its flesh of a greyish colour; they fly
                                 generally in great flocks, as the starlings are wont to do with us:
                                 but the thing which renders these birds wonderful is, that they are
                                 so fond of the water of a certain fountain in
                                    <placeName>Corasson</placeName>, or
                                    <placeName>Bactria</placeName>, that where-ever that water is
                                 carried, they follow; on which account it is carefully preserved;
                                 for where ever the locusts fall, the <orgName>Armenian
                                    priests</orgName>, who are provided with this water, bring a
                                 quanity of it, and place in jars, or pour it into little channels
                                 in the fields, the next day whole troops of these birds arrive and
                                 quickly deliver the people from the locusts. <bibl>Universal

                                 <persName>Sir John Chardin</persName> has given us, the following
                                 passage from an antient traveller, in relation to this bird. In
                                    <placeName>Cyprus</placeName> about the time that the corn was
                                 ripe for the sickle, the earth produced such a quantity of
                                 cavalettes, or locusts, that they obscured sometimes the splendour
                                 of the sun. Wherever these came, they burnt and eat up all; for
                                 this there was no remedy, since, as fast as they were destroyed,
                                 the earth produced more: <name type="divin">God</name>, however,
                                 raised them up a means for their deliverance, which happened thus.
                                 In <placeName>Persia</placeName>, near the <placeName ref="Cuerch"
                                    >city of Cuerch</placeName> there is a fountain of water, which
                                 has a wonderful property of destroying these insects; for a pitcher
                                 full of this being carried in the open air, without passing through
                                 house or vault, and being set on an high place, certain birds which
                                 follow it, and fly and cry after the men who carry it from the
                                 fountain, come to the place where it is fixed. These birds are red
                                 and black, and fly in great flocks together, like starlings; the
                                    <orgName>Turks</orgName> and <orgName>Persians</orgName> call
                                 them <orgName>Musulmans</orgName>. These birds no sooner came to
                                 Cyprus, but they destroyed the locusts with which the Island was
                                 infested; but if the water be spilt or lost these creatures
                                 immediately disappear; which accident fell out when the Turks took
                                 this Island; for one of them going up into the steeple of
                                 Famagusta, and finding there a pitcher of this water, he, fancying
                                 that it contained gold or silver, or some precious thing, broke it,
                                 and spilt what was therein; since which the Cypriots have been as
                                 much tormented as ever by the locusts. </p>
                              <p> On the confines of the <placeName>Medes</placeName> and of
                                    <placeName>Armenia</placeName>, at certain times a great
                                 quantity of Birds are seen who resemble our blackbirds, and they
                                 have a property sufficiently curious to make me mention it. When
                                 the corn in these parts begins to grow, it is astonishing to see
                                 the number of Locusts with which all the fields are covered. The
                                    <orgName>Armenians</orgName> have no other method of delivering
                                 themselves from these insects, than by going in procession round
                                 the fields and sprinkling them with a particular water which they
                                 take care to preserve in their houses. For this water comes from a
                                 great distance, they fetch it from a Well belonging to one of their
                                    <rs type="building" subtype="temple">Convents</rs> near the
                                 frontiers, and they say that the bodies of many <orgName>Christian
                                    martyrs</orgName> were formerly thrown into this well. These
                                 processions and the sprinkling continue three or four days, after
                                 which the Birds that I have mentioned come in great flights, and
                                 whether it be that they eat the locusts, or drive them away, in two
                                 or three days the country is cleared of them.
                                    <bibl>Tavernier.</bibl>
                              </p>
                              <p> At <placeName>Mosul</placeName> and at
                                    <placeName>Haleb</placeName>, says Niebuhr, I heard much of the
                                 Locust Bird, without seeing it. They there call it <hi
                                    rend="italic">Samarmar</hi>, or as others pronounce it, <hi
                                    rend="italic">Samarmog</hi>. It is said to be black, larger than
                                 a sparrow, and no ways pleasant to the palate. I am assured that it
                                 every day destroys an incredible number of Locusts; they pretend
                                 nevertheless that the Locusts sometimes defend themselves, and
                                 devour the Bird with its feathers, when they have overpowered it by
                                 numbers. When the children in the frontier towns of
                                    <placeName>Arabia</placeName> catch a live Locust, they place it
                                 before them and cry <hi rend="italic">Samarmog</hi>! And because it
                                 stoops down terrified at the noise, or at the motion of the child,
                                 or clings more closely to its place, the children believe that it
                                 fears the name of its enemy, that it hides itself, and attempts to
                                 throw stones. The <hi rend="italic">Samarmog</hi> is not a native
                                 of <placeName>Mosul</placeName> or <placeName>Haleb</placeName>,
                                 but they go to seek it in <placeName>Khorasan</placeName> with much
                                 ceremony. When the Locusts multiply very greatly, the government
                                 sends persons worthy of trust to a spring near <placeName
                                    ref="Samarûn">the village of <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Samarûn</hi></placeName>, situated in a plain between four
                                 mountains, by <placeName ref="Mesched"><hi rend="italic"
                                       >Mesched</hi></placeName>, or <placeName ref="Musa_er_ridda"
                                       ><hi rend="italic">Musa er ridda</hi></placeName>, in that
                                 province of <placeName>Persia</placeName>. The deputies with the
                                 ceremonies prescribed fill a chest with this water, and pitch the
                                 chest so that the water may neither evaporate nor be spilt before
                                 their return. From the spring to the Town whence they were sent,
                                 the chest must always be between heaven and earth: they must
                                 neither place it on the ground, nor under any roof, lest it should
                                 lose all its virtue. <placeName>Mosul</placeName> being surrounded
                                 with a wall, the water must not pass under the gate way, but it is
                                 received over the wall, and the chest placed upon <rs

                                    time immemorial the honour to possess this chest upon its
                                    roof</rs>. When this precious water has been brought from

                                    >Samarmog</hi>, who perceived the smell of the water thro' such
                                 a quantity of ordure, he did not answer me, but was very much
                                 scandalized that the government should have permitted the stork to
                                 make her nest upon so rare a treasure, and still more angry, that
                                 for more than nine years, the government had not sent to procure
                                 fresh water. <bibl>Niebuhr. Desc. de l'Arabie.</bibl>

                              <p> The Locusts are remarkable for the hieroglyphic that they bear
                                 upon the forehead, their colour is green throughout the whole body,
                                 excepting a little yellow rim that surrounds their head, which is
                                 lost at their eyes. This insect has two upper wings pretty solid:
                                 they are green like the rest of the body, except that there is in
                                 each a little white spot. The Locust keeps them extended like great
                                 sails of a ship going before the wind, it has besides two other
                                 wings underneath the former, and which resemble a light transparent
                                 stuff pretty much like a cobweb, and which it makes use of in the
                                 manner of smack sails that are along a vessel; but when the Locust
                                 reposes herself she does like a vessel that lies at anchor, for she
                                 keeps the second sails furled under the first. <bibl>Norden.</bibl>

                              <p> One of these <hi rend="italic">Hykes</hi> is usually six yards
                                 long and 5 or 6 foot broad, serving the Arab for a compleat dress
                                 in the day, and for his bed and covering in the night. It is a
                                 loose but troublesome kind of garment, being frequently
                                 disconcerted and falling upon the ground, so that the person who
                                 wears it, is every moment obliged to tuck it up, and fold it anew
                                 about his body. This shews the great use there is for a girdle in
                                 attending any active employment, and in consequence thereof, the
                                 force of the scripture injunction alluding thereunto, of <hi
                                    rend="italic">having our loyns girded</hi>. The method of
                                 wearing these garments, with the use they are at other times put
                                 to, in serving for coverlets to their beds, should induce us to
                                 take the finer sort of them at least, such as are wore by the
                                 Ladies and persons of distinction, to be the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >peplus</hi> of the antients. It is very probable likewise, that
                                 the loose folding garment, (the <hi rend="italic">Toga</hi> I take
                                 it to be) of the Romans, was of this kind: for if the drapery of
                                 their statues is to instruct us, this is actually no other than
                                 what the Arabs appear in, when they are folded up in their <hi
                                    rend="italic">Hykes</hi>. Instead of the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >fibula</hi>, they join together, with thread or a wooden
                                 bodkin, the two upper corners of this garment, which being first
                                 placed over one of their shoulders, they fold the rest of it
                                 afterwards round their bodies. <bibl>Shaw.</bibl>

                              <p> The employment of the women is to prepare their wool, spin, and
                                 weave in looms hung lengthways in their tents. These looms are
                                 formed by a list of an ell and a half long, to which the threads of
                                 the warp are fixed at one end, and at the other on a roller of
                                 equal length; the weight of which, being suspended, keeps them
                                 stretched. The threads of the warp are so hung as to be readily
                                 intersected. Instead of shuttles, the women pass the thread of the
                                 woof thro' the warp with their fingers, and with an iron comb,
                                 having a handle, press the woof to give a body to their cloth. Each
                                 piece of about 5 ells long, and an ell and a half wide, is called a
                                    <hi rend="italic">haick</hi>; it receives neither dressing,
                                 milling nor dying, but is immediately fit for use: it is the

                                 without seam, and incapable of varying according to the caprices of
                                 fashion. When dirty it is washed: the Moor is wrapped up in it day
                                 and night, and this <hi rend="italic">haick</hi> is the living
                                 model of the drapery of the ancients. <bibl>Chenier.</bibl>

                                 with birds called goarazes, that breed there. These birds are about
                                 the size of a hen, their colour a rich purple, inclining to red.
                                 They are white when hatched, and soon become black, but as they

                                 like herds of cows. The Camel driver follows singing, and from time
                                 to time giving a sudden whistle. The louder he sings and whistles,
                                 the faster the Camels go, and they stop as soon as he ceases to
                                 sing. The Camel-drivers to relieve each other sing alternately, and
                                 when they wish their beasts to brouze for half an hour on what they
                                 can find, they amuse themselves by smoking a pipe, after which
                                 beginning again to sing, the Camels immediately proceed.

                              <p> On the road we passed the skeleton of a camel, which now and then
                                 happens in <rs type="place" ref="desert">the desert</rs>. These are
                                 poor creatures that have perished with fatigue: for those which are
                                 killed for the sustenance of the Arabs, are carried away bones and
                                 all together. Of the hides are made the soles of the slippers which
                                 are worn in <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, without any dressing, but
                                 what the sun can give them. The circumstances of this animal's
                                 death, when his strength fails him on the road, have something in
                                 them affecting to humanity. Such are his patience and perseverance,
                                 that he pursues his journey without flagging, as long as he has
                                 power to support its weight; and such are his fortitude and spirit,
                                 that he will never give out, until nature sinks beneath the
                                 complicated ills which press upon him. Then, and then only, will he
                                 resign his burden and body to the ground. Nor stripes, nor caresses
                                 nor food, nor rest, will make him rise again! His vigor is
                                 exhausted, and life ebbs out apace! This the Arabs are very
                                 sensible of, and kindly plunge a sword into the breast of the dying
                                 beast, to shorten his pangs. Even the Arab feels remorse when he
                                 commits this deed: his hardened heart is moved at the loss of a
                                 faithful servant. <bibl>Eyles Irwin.</bibl>

                              <p> In the Monthly Magazine for January 1800, is a letter from
                                 professor Heering recommending the introduction of these animals at
                                 the Cape, but the Camel is made only for level countries. "This
                                 animal is very ill qualified to travel upon the snow or wet ground;
                                 the breadth in which they carry their legs, when they slip, often
                                 occasions their splitting themselves; so that when they fall with
                                 great burdens they seldom rise again." <bibl>Jonas Hanway.</bibl>

                              <p> No creature seems so peculiarly fitted to the climate in which it
                                 exists. We cannot doubt the nature of the one has been adapted to
                                 that of the other by some <hi rend="italic">disposing
                                    intelligence</hi>. Designing the Camel to dwell in a country
                                 where he can find little nourishment, <name type="myth"
                                    >Nature</name> has been sparing of her materials in the whole of
                                 his formation, She has not bestowed upon him the plump fleshiness
                                 of the ox, horse, or elephant; but limiting herself to what is
                                 strictly necessary, she has given him a small head without ears, at
                                 the end of a long neck without flesh. She has taken from his legs
                                 and thighs every muscle not immediately resquisite for motion; and
                                 in short has bestowed on his withered body only the vessels and
                                 tendons necessary to connect his frame together. She has furnished
                                 him with a strong jaw, that he may grind the hardest aliments; but
                                 lest he should consume too much, she has contracted his stomach,
                                 and obliged him to chew the cud. She has lined his foot with a lump
                                 of flesh, which, sliding in the mud, and being no way adapted for
                                 climbing, fits him only for a dry, level, and sandy soil, like that
                                 of <placeName>Arabia</placeName>. She has evidently destined him
                                 likewise to slavery, by refusing him every sort of defence against
                                 his enemies. Destitute of the horns of the bull, the hoofs of the
                                 horse, the tooth of the elephant, and the swiftness of the stag,
                                 how can the camel resist or avoid the attacks of the lion, the
                                 tyger, or even the wolf? To preserve the species therefore, <name
                                    type="myth">Nature</name> has concealed him in the depths of the
                                    <rs type="place" ref="desert">vast deserts</rs>, where the want
                                 of vegetables can attract no game, and whence the want of game
                                 repels every voracious animal. Tyranny must have expelled man from
                                 the habitable parts of <placeName ref="Earth_planet">the
                                    earth</placeName>, before the Camel could have lost his liberty.
                                 Become domestic, he has rendered habitable the most barren soil
                                    <placeName ref="the_world">the world</placeName> contains. He
                                 alone supplies all his master's wants. The milk of the Camel
                                 nourishes the family of the Arab, under the various forms of curds,
                                 cheese, and butter; and they often feed upon his flesh. Slippers
                                 and harness are made of his skin, and tents and clothing of his
                                 hair. Heavy burthens are transported by his means, and when the
                                 earth denies forage to the horse, so valuable to the Bedouin, the
                                 she-camel supplies that deficiency by her milk, at no other cost,
                                 for so many advantages, than a few stalks of brambles or wormwood,
                                 and pounded date kernels. So great is the importance of the Camel
                                 to the desert, that were it deprived of that useful animal, it must
                                 infallibly lose every inhabitant. <bibl>Volney.</bibl>

                                 be magified within it; insomuch that a shrub seemed as big as a
                                 tree, and a flock of Achbobbas might be mistaken for a caravan of
                                 Camels. This seeming collection of water, always advances, about a
                                 quarter of a mile before us, whilst the intermediate space appears
                                 to be in one continued glow, occasioned by the quivering undulating

                                 are extracted by the powerful influence of the sun.

                                 deception. "It is the ancient custom of Fortune, and time has long
                                 established the habit, that she at first bewilders the thirsty
                                 travellers in the path of desire, by the misty vapour of
                                 disappointment; but when their distress and misery has reached
                                 extremity, suddenly relieving them from the dark windings of
                                 confusion and error, she conducts them to the fountains of
                                 enjoyment." </p>
                              <p> "The burning heat of the sun was reflected with double violence
                                 from the hot sand, and the distant ridges of the hills, seen thro'
                                 the ascending vapour, seemed to wave and fluctuate like the
                                 unsettled sea." <bibl>Mungo Park.</bibl>

                                 sufferings. </p>
                              <p> "I pushed on as fast as possible, in hopes of reaching some
                                 watering-place in the course of the night. My thirst was by this
                                 time become insufferable; my mouth was parched and inflamed; a
                                 sudden dimness would frequently come over my eyes, with other
                                 symptoms of fainting; and my horse being very much fatigued, I
                                 began seriously to apprehend that I should perish of thirst. To
                                 relieve the burning pain in my mouth and throat, I chewed the
                                 leaves of different shrubs, but found them all bitter and of no
                                 service to me. </p>
                              <p> A little before sunset, having reached the top of a gentle rising,
                                 I climbed a high tree, from the topmost branches of which I cast a
                                 melancholy look over the barren wilderness, but without discovering
                                 the most distant trace of a human dwelling. The same dismal
                                 uniformity of shrubs and sand every where presents itself, and the

                              <p> Descending from the tree, I found my horse devouring the stubble
                                 and brushwood with great avidity; and as I was now too faint to
                                 attempt walking, and my horse too much fatigued to carry me, I
                                 thought it but an act of humanity, and perhaps the last I should
                                 ever have it in my power to perform, to take off his bridle and let
                                 him shift for himself: in doing which I was suddenly affected with
                                 sickness and giddiness, and falling upon the sand, felt as if the
                                 hour of death was fast approaching. Here then, thought I, after a
                                 short but ineffectual struggle, terminate all my hopes of being
                                 useful in my day and generation; here must the short span of my
                                 life come to an end.—I cast (as I believed) a last look on the
                                 surrounding scene, and whilst I reflected on the awful change that
                                 was about to take place, <placeName ref="the_world">this
                                    world</placeName> with its enjoyments seemed to vanish from my
                                 recollection. <name type="myth">Nature</name> however, at length
                                 resumed its functions; and on recovering my senses, I found myself
                                 stretched upon the sand with the bridle still in my hand, and the
                                 sun just sinking behind the trees. I now summoned all my
                                 resolution, and determined to make another effort to prolong my
                                 existence. And as the evening was somewhat cool, I resolved to
                                 travel as far as my limbs would carry me, in hopes of reaching (my
                                 only resource) a watering place. With this view I put the bridle on
                                 my horse, and driving him before me, went slowly along for about an
                                 hour, when I perceived some lightning from the north east, a most
                                 delightful sight, for it promised rain. The darkness and lightning
                                 increased very rapidly; and in less than an hour I heard the wind
                                 roaring among the bushes. I had already opened my mouth to receive
                                 the refreshing drops which I expected, but I was instantly covered
                                 with a cloud of sand, driven with such force by the wind as to give
                                 a very disagreeable sensation to my face and arms, and I was
                                 obliged to mount my horse and stop under a bush, to prevent being
                                 suffocated. The sand continued to fly in amazing quantities for
                                 near an hour, after which I again set forward, and travelled with
                                 difficulty, until ten o'clock. About this time I was agreeably
                                 surprized by some very vivid flashes of lightning, followed by a
                                 few heavy drops of rain. In a little time the sand ceased to fly,
                                 and I alighted, and spread out all my clean clothes to collect the
                                 rain, which at length I saw would certainly fall.—For more than an
                                 hour it rained plentifully, and I quenched my thirst, by wringing
                                 and sucking my clothes. <bibl>Park's Travels in the Interior of

                              <p> All the time I was in Barbary I could never get sight of above
                                 three or four Dromedaries. These the Arabs call Mehera, the
                                 singular is Meheri. They are of several sorts, and degrees of
                                 value, some worth many common Camels, others scarce worth two or
                                 three. To look on, they seem little different from the rest of that
                                 Species, only I think the Excrescence on a Dromedary's Back is
                                 somewhat less than that of a Camel. What is reported of their
                                 sleeping, or rather seeming scarce alive, for some Time after
                                 coming into <placeName ref="the_world">this World</placeName>, is
                                 no Fable. The longer they lie so, the more excellent they prove in
                                 their Kind, and consequently of higher Price and Esteem. None lie
                                 in that Trance more than ten Days and Nights. These that do, are
                                 pretty rare, and are called Ashari from Aashara, which signifies
                                 ten in Arabick. I saw one such, perfectly white all over, belonging
                                 to Lella Oumane Princess of that noble Arab Neja, named Hayl ben
                                 Ali, I spoke of, and upon which she put a very great Value, never
                                 sending it abroad but upon some extraordinary Occasion, when the
                                 greatest Expedition was required; having others, inferior in
                                 swiftness, for more ordinary Messages. They say that one of these
                                 Aasharies will, in one Night, and thro' a level Country, traverse
                                 as much Ground as any single Horse can perform in ten, which is no
                                 Exaggeration of the Matter, since many have affirmed to me, that it
                                 makes nothing of holding its rapid Pace, which is a most violent
                                 Hard Trot, for four and twenty Hours upon a Stretch without shewing
                                 the least Sign of Weariness, or Inclination to Bait; and that
                                 having then swallowed a Ball or two of Sort of a Paste, made up of
                                 Barley-Meal, and may be a little Powder of Dates among it, with a
                                 Bowl of Water, or Camel's Milk, if to be had, and which the Courier
                                 seldom forgets to be provided with, in Skins, as well for the
                                 Sustenance of himself as of his Pegasus, the indefatigable Animal
                                 will seem as fresh as at first setting out, and ready to continue
                                 running at the same scarce credible Rate, for as many Hours longer,
                                 and so on from one <rs type="place" ref="desert">Extremity of the

                                 other Refreshment. This has been averred to me, by, I believe more
                                 than a thousand Arabs and Moors, all agreeing in every Particular. </p>
                              <p> I happened to be, once in particular, at the Tent of that
                                 Princess, with Ali ben Mahamoud, the Bey, or Vice-Roy of the
                                 Algerine Eastern Province, when he went thither to celebrate his
                                 Nuptials with Ambarca, her only Daughter, if I mistake not. Among
                                 other Entertainments she gave her Guests, the favourite white
                                 Dromedary was brought forth, ready Saddled and Bridled. I say
                                 Bridled, because the Thong, which serves instead of a Bridle, was
                                 put thro' the Hole purposely made in the Gristle of the Creature's
                                 Nose. The Arab appointed to mount, was straightly laced, from the
                                 very Loins quite to his Throat, in a strong Leathern Jacket; they
                                 never riding these Animals any otherwise accoutred, so impetuously
                                 violent are the Concussions the Rider undergoes, during that rapid
                                 Motion, that were he to be loose. I much question whether a few
                                 Hours such unintermitting Agitation would not endanger the bursting
                                 of some of his Entrails: And this the Arabs scruple not to
                                 acknowledge. We were to be diverted with seeing this fine Ashari
                                 run against some of the swiftest Barbs in the whole Neja, which is
                                 famed for having good ones, of the true Libyan Breed, shaped like
                                 Greyhounds, and which will sometimes run down an Ostridge; which
                                 few of the very best can pretend to do, especially upon a hard
                                 Ground, perfectly level. We all started like Racers, and for the
                                 first Spurt, most of the best mounted among us kept up pretty well,
                                 but our Grass fed Horses soon flagged: Several of the Libyan and
                                 Numidian Runners held Pace till we, who still followed upon a good
                                 round Hand Gallop, could no longer discern them, and then gave out;
                                 as we were told after their Return. When the Dromedary had been out
                                 of our Sight about half an Hour, we again espied it flying towards
                                 us with an amazing Volocity, and in a very few Moments was among
                                 us, and seemingly nothing concerned; while the Horses and Mares
                                 were all on a Foam, and scarce able to breathe, as was, likewise, a
                                 fleet, tall Greyhound Bitch, of the young Prince's, who had
                                 followed and kept Pace the whole Time, and was no sooner got back
                                 to us, but lay down panting as if ready to expire. I cannot tell
                                 how many Miles we went; but we were near three Hours in coming
                                 leisurely back to the Tents, yet made no Stop in the Way. The young
                                 Prince Hamet ben al Guydom ben Sakhari, and his younger Brother
                                 Messoud, told their new Brother-in-Law, that they defied all the
                                 Potentates of <placeName>Africa</placeName> to shew him such an
                                 Ashari; and the Arab who rode it, challenged the Bey to lay his
                                 Lady a Wager of 1000 Ducats, that he did not bring him an Answer to
                                 a Letter from the Prince of Wargala, in less than four Days, tho'
                                 Leo Africanus, Marmol, and several others assure us, that it is no
                                 less than forty Spanish Leagues, of four Miles each, South of
                                 Tuggurt to which Place, upon another Occasion, as I shall observe,
                                 we made six tedious Days March from the Neighbourhood of Biscara,
                                 North of which we were then, at least thirty Hours riding, if I
                                 remember rightly. However the Bey, who was a Native of Biscara, and
                                 consequently well acquainted with the Sahara, durst not take him
                                 up. By all Circumstances, and the Description given us, besides
                                 what I know of the Matter my self, it could not be much less than

                              <p> We were here at once surprised and terrified by a sight surely the
                                 most magnificent in <placeName ref="the_world">the
                                    world</placeName>. In that vast expanse of <rs type="place"
                                    ref="desert">desert</rs>, from W. and to N. W. of us, we saw a
                                 number of prodigious pillars of sand at different distances, at
                                 times moving with great celerity, at others stalking with a
                                 majestic slowness: at intervals we thought they were coming in a
                                 very few moments to overwhelm us, and small quantities of sand did
                                 actually more than once reach us. Again they would retreat so as to
                                 be almost out of sight, their tops reaching to the very clouds.
                                 There the tops often separated from the bodies, and these once
                                 disjoined, dispersed in the air and did not appear more. Sometimes
                                 they were broken near the middle, as if struck with a large cannon
                                 shot. About noon they began to advance with considerable swiftness
                                 upon us, the wind being very strong at north. Eleven of them ranged
                                 alongside of us about the distance of three miles. The greatest
                                 diameter of the largest appeared to me at that distance as if it
                                 would measure ten feet. They retired from us with a wind at S. E.
                                 leaving an impression upon my mind to which I can give no name;
                                 though surely one ingredient in it was fear, with a considerable
                                 deal of wonder and astonishment. It was in vain to think of flying,
                                 the swiftest horse, or fastest sailing ship could be of no use to
                                 carry us out of this danger, and the full persuasion of this
                                 rivetted me as if to the spot where I stood. </p>
                              <p> On the 15th the same appearance of moving pillars of sand
                                 presented themselves to us, only they seemed to be more in number,
                                 and less in size. They came several times in a direction close upon
                                 us; that is, I believe, within less than two miles. They began
                                 immediately after sun-rise, like a thick wood, and almost darkened
                                 the sun. His rays shining through them for near an hour, gave them
                                 an appearance of pillars of fire. Our people now became desperate:
                                 the Greeks shrieked out, and said it was the day of judgement.

                                 separating from the rest met a hermit whose cell was near, and
                                 entered into talk with him and communicated the design of <persName

                                 that plain, but that its founder would be a man called

                                 and returned thanks to<name type="divin">God</name>for that he was
                                 chosen to execute his orders. His courtiers waited for an
                                 explanation of this conduct with eagerness, and <persName
                                    ref="Caliph_Giaffar">the Caliph</persName> told them thus.
                                 During <time>the Caliphate of the

                                 for the whole. On one of my days as <rs type="person"

                                 discovered that I had been the thief. In her anger she abused me
                                 plentifully, and among other terms of reproach, she called me
                                    <persName>Moclas</persName>, the name of a famous robber in
                                 those days; and during the rest of her life she never called me by
                                 any other name. Therefore I know that<name type="divin"
                                 >God</name>has destined me to perform this work.

                                 <placeName ref="Bagdad">Bagdat</placeName> was founded in
                                 consequence of a singular superstition. A sect called
                                    <orgName>Ravendiens</orgName> conceived that they ought to
                                 render those honours to <orgName>the Caliphs</orgName>, which

                                 numbers to <placeName>Haschemia</placeName>, where <persName

                                 and made around his <rs type="building" subtype="palace"
                                    >palace</rs> the same processions and ceremonies which the

                                    at <placeName>Mecca</placeName></rs>. The Caliph prohibited
                                 this, commanding them not to profane a religious ceremony which
                                 ought to be reserved solely to <rs type="building" subtype="temple"
                                    >the Temple at <placeName>Mecca</placeName></rs>. The

                                 and continued to act as before. </p>

                                 This astonished them, but they soon recovered their courage, took
                                 arms, marched to the prison, forced the doors, delivered their

                                 they resisted, and repulsed him so vigorously that he had nearly
                                 fallen a victim. But timely succours arrived and after a great
                                 slaughter these fanatics were expelled the town. This singular
                                 rebellion arising from excess of loyalty so disgusted
                                    <persName>Almanzor</persName> that he determined to forsake the
                                 town which had witnessed it, and accordingly laid the foundation of

                              <p> At <placeName>Bagdad</placeName> are many cranes who build their
                                 nests upon the tops of the minarets, and the loftiest houses. </p>
                              <p> At <placeName>Adanaqui</placeName>—cranes are so abundant, that
                                 there is scarcely a house which has not several nests upon it. They
                                 are very tame, and the inhabitants never molest them. When any
                                 thing disturbs these birds, they make a violent clatter with their
                                 long beaks, which is sometimes repeated by the others all over the
                                 town; and this noise will sometimes continue for several minutes.
                                 It is as loud as a watchman's rattle, and not much unlike it in
                                 sound. <bibl>Jackson.</bibl>
                              </p>
                              <p> The cranes were now arrived at their respective quarters, and a
                                 couple had made their nest, which is bigger in circumference than a
                                 bushel, on a dome close by our chamber. This pair stood, side by
                                 side, with great gravity, shewing no concern at what was
                                 transacting beneath them, but at intervals twisting about their
                                 long necks, and cluttering with their beaks, turned behind them
                                 upon their backs, as it were in concert. This was continued the
                                 whole night. An Owl, a bird also unmolested, was perched hard by,

                                 <placeName ref="Tower_of_Babel">The Tower of
                                       <persName>Nimrod</persName> or Babel</placeName> is situate
                                 on that side of <placeName ref="Tigris">Tygris</placeName> that

                                 distant from <placeName>Babylon</placeName> seven or eight miles;
                                 which <rs type="building" subtype="tower">tower</rs> is ruinated on
                                 every side, and with the falling of it there is made a great
                                 mountaine; so that it hath no forme at all, yet there is a great
                                 part of it standing, which is compassed and almost covered with the
                                 aforesayd fallings: this Tower was builded and made of foure-square
                                 brickes, which brickes were made of earth, and dried in the Sunne
                                 in maner and forme following: first they layed a lay of brickes,
                                 then a mat made of canes, square as the brickes, and instead of
                                 lime, they daubed it with earth: these mats of canes are at this
                                 time so strong, that it is a thing woonderfull to beholde, being of
                                 such great antiquity: I have gone round about it, and have not
                                 found any place where there hath bene any doore or entrance: it may
                                 be in my judgement in circuit about a mile, and rather lesse than
                                 more. </p>
                              <p> This Tower in effect is contrary to all other things which are
                                 seene afar off, for they seeme small and the more nere a man
                                 commeth to them the bigger they be: but this tower afar off seemeth
                                 a very great thing, and the nerer you come to it the lesser. My
                                 judgement and reason of this is, that because the Tower is set in a
                                 very great plaine, and hath nothing more about to make any shew
                                 saving the ruines of it which it hath made round about, and for
                                 this respect descrying it afarre off, that piece of the Tower which
                                 yet standeth with the mountaine that is made of the substance that
                                 hath fallen from it, maketh a greater shew than you shall finde

                              <p> In the middle of a vast and level plain, about a quarter of a
                                 league from <placeName>Euphrates</placeName>, which in that place
                                 runs westward, appears a heap of ruined buildings, like a huge
                                 mountain, the materials of which are so confounded together that
                                 one knows not what to make of it. Its figure is square, and rises
                                 in form of a tower or pyramid with four fronts which answer to the
                                 four quarters of the compass; but it seems longer from north to S.
                                 than from E. to W. and is, as far as I could judge by my pacing it,
                                 a large quarter of a league. Its situation and form correspond with
                                 that <rs type="building" subtype="tower">pyramid which
                                       <persName>Strabo</persName> calls the tower of Belus</rs>;
                                 and is in all likelihood the <placeName ref="Tower_of_Babel">tower
                                    of Nimrod in <placeName>Babylon</placeName> or
                                 Babel</placeName>, as that place is still called. In that author's
                                 time it had nothing remaining of the stairs and other ornaments
                                 mentioned by <persName>Herodotus</persName>, the greatest part of
                                 it having been ruined by <persName>Xerxes</persName>; and
                                    <persName>Alexander</persName> who designed to have restored it
                                 to its former lustre, was prevented by death. There appear no marks
                                 of ruins without the compass of that huge mass, to convince one
                                 that so great a city as <placeName>Babylon</placeName> had ever
                                 stood there; all one discovers within 50 or 60 paces of it, being
                                 only the remains here and there of some foundations of buildings;
                                 and the country round about it so flat and level, that one can
                                 hardly believe it should be chosen for the situation of so great
                                 and noble a city as <placeName>Babylon</placeName>, or that there
                                 were ever any remarkable buildings on it. But for my part I am
                                 astonished there appears so much as there does, considering it is
                                    <time>at least 4000 years</time> since that city was built; and
                                 that <persName>Diodorus Siculus</persName> tells us, it was reduced
                                 almost to nothing in his time. The height of this mountain of ruins
                                 is not in every part equal, but exceeds <rs type="building"
                                    subtype="palace">the highest palace in
                                       <placeName>Naples</placeName></rs>: it is a mishapen mass,
                                 wherein there is no appearance of regularity; in some places it
                                 rises in points, is craggy and inaccessible; in others it is
                                 smoother and is of easier ascent; there are also tracks of torrents
                                 from the top to the bottom caused by the rains, and both withinside
                                 and upon it, one sees parts, some higher and some lower. It is not
                                 to be discovered whether ever there were any steps to ascend it, or
                                 any doors to enter into it; whence one may easily judge that the
                                 stairs ran winding about on the outside; and that being the less
                                 solid parts, they were soonest demolished, so that not the least
                                 sign of any appears at present. </p>
                              <p> Withinside one finds some grottos, but so ruined that one can make
                                 nothing of them, whether they were built at the same time with that
                                 work, or made since by the peasants for shelter, which last seems
                                 to be the most likely. The <orgName>Mohammedans</orgName> believe
                                 that these caverns were appointed by<name type="divin">God</name>as
                                 places of punishment for <name type="divin">Harut</name> and <name
                                    type="divin">Marut</name>, two angels, who they suppose were
                                 sent from <rs type="metaplace" subtype="divin" ref="Heaven"
                                    >heaven</rs> to judge <orgName>the armies of men</orgName>, but
                                 did not execute their commissions as they ought. It is evident from
                                 these ruins, that <placeName ref="Tower_of_Babel">the tower of
                                    Nimrod</placeName> was built with great and thick bricks, as I
                                 carefully observed, causing holes to be dug in several places for
                                 the purpose; but they do not appear to have been burnt, but dried
                                 in the sun, which is extreme hot in those parts. In laying these
                                 bricks neither lime nor sand was employed, but only earth tempered
                                 and petrified, and in those parts which made the floors, there had
                                 been mingled with that earth which served instead of lime, bruised
                                 reeds, or hard straw, such as large mats are made of to strengthen
                                 the work. Afterwards one perceives at certain distances in divers
                                 places, especially where the strongest buttresses were to be,
                                 several other bricks of the same size, but more solid and burnt in
                                 a kiln, and set in good lime, or bitumen, nevertheless the greatest
                                 number consists of those which are only dried in the sun. </p>

                                 <p> I make no doubt but this ruin was the ancient Babel, and the
                                    tower of <persName>Nimrod</persName>; for besides the evidence
                                    of its situation, it is acknowledged to be such by the people of
                                    the country, being vulgarly called Babil by <orgName>the

                                 spreads itself over a great field, that is always full of it. It is
                                 free for every one to take: they use it to chaulk or pitch their

                                 water: with it also they pitch their houses, made of palm-tree
                                 branches. If it was not that the inundations of the <hi

                                 to the river, there would have been mountains of it long since. The
                                 very ground and stones thereabouts afford bitumen; and the fields

                              <p> The Mussulmanns use, like the Roman Catholics, a rosary of beads
                                 called Tusbah, or implement of praise. It consists, if I recollect
                                 aright, of ninty nine beads; in dropping which through the fingers,
                                 they repeat the attributes of God, as "O Creator, O Merciful, O
                                 Forgiving, O Omnipotent, O Omniscient, &amp;c. &amp;c." This act of
                                 devotion is called Taleel, from the repetition of the letter L, or
                                 Laum, which occurs in the word <name type="divin">Allah</name>,
                                 (God), always joined to the epithet or attribute, as Ya <name
                                    type="divin">Allah</name> Khalick, O God, the Creator; Ya <name
                                    type="divin">Allah</name> Kerreem, O God, the Merciful, &amp;c.
                                 &amp;c. The devotees may be seen muttering their beads as they walk
                                 the streets, and in the interval of conversation in company. The
                                 rosaries of persons of fortune and rank have the beads of diamonds,
                                 pearls, rubies and emeralds. Those of the humble are strung with
                                 berries, coral, or glass beads. <bibl>Note to the Bahar

                              <p> The ninty nine beads of the Mohammedan rosary are divided into
                                 three equal lengths, by a little string, at the end of which hang a
                                 long piece of coral and a large bead of the same. The more devout,
                                 or hypocritical Turks, like the Catholics have usually their bead
                                 string in their hands. <bibl>Tavernier.</bibl>

                              <p> Zohak was the fifth King of the Pischdadian dynasty, lineally
                                 descended from Shedâd who perished with the tribe of Ad. Zohak
                                 murdered his predecessor, and invented the punishments of the
                                 cross, and of fleaing alive. The Devil who had long served him,
                                 requested at last as a recompence, permission to kiss his
                                 shoulders, immediately two serpents grew there, who fed upon his
                                 flesh and endeavoured to get at his brain. The Devil now suggested
                                 a remedy, which was to quiet them by giving them every day the
                                 brains of two men, killed for that purpose: this tyranny lasted
                                 long, till a blacksmith of <placeName>Ispahan</placeName> whose
                                 children had been nearly all slain to feed the King's serpents,
                                 raised his leathern apron as the standard of revolt, and deposed
                                 Zohak. Zohak, say the Persians, is still living in the cave of his
                                 punishment, a sulphureous vapour issues from the place, and if a
                                 stone be flung in there comes out a voice and cries, why dost thou
                                 fling stones at me? this cavern is in the mountain of Demawend,
                                 which reaches from that of Elwend, towards Teheran.

                              <p> I acknowledge that I never tried the secret of the Hand of Glory,
                                 but I have thrice assisted at the definitive judgment of certain
                                 criminals, who, under the torture, confessed having used it. Being
                                 asked what it was, how they procured it, and what were its uses and
                                 properties? they answered, first, that the use of the Hand of Glory
                                 was to stupify those to whom it was presented, and to render them
                                 motionless, insomuch that they could not stir, any more than if
                                 they were dead; secondly, that it was the hand of a hanged man; and
                                 thirdly, that it must be prepared in the manner following. </p>
                              <p> Take the hand, left or right, of a person hanged and exposed on
                                 the highway; wrap it up in a piece of a shroud or winding sheet, in
                                 which let it be well squeezed, to get out any small quantity of
                                 blood that may have remained in it; then put it into an earthen
                                 vessel with Zimat saltpetre, salt, and long pepper, the whole well
                                 powdered; leave it fifteen days in that vessel; afterwards take it
                                 out, and expose it to the noontide sun in the dog days, till it is
                                 thoroughly dry, and if the Sun is not sufficient, put it into an
                                 oven heated with fern and vervain. Then compose a kind of candle
                                 with the fat of a hanged man, virgin wax, and sisame of Lapland.
                                 The Hand of Glory is used as a candlestick to hold this candle,
                                 when lighted. Its properties are, that wheresoever any one goes
                                 with this dreadful instrument, the persons to whom it is presented
                                 will be deprived of all power of motion. On being asked if there
                                 was no remedy or antidote, to counteract this charm, they said the
                                 Hand of Glory would cease to take effect, and thieves could not
                                 make use of it, if the threshold of the door of the house, and
                                 other places by which they might enter, were anointed with an
                                 unguent composed of the gall of a black cat, the fat of a white
                                 hen, and the blood of a screech owl, which mixture must necessarily
                                 be prepared during the dog days. <bibl>Grose. Provincial Glossary

                              <p> The habitations of the Saints are always beside the sanctuary, or
                                 tomb, of their ancestors, which they take care to adorn. Some of
                                 them possess, close to their houses, gardens, trees, or cultivated
                                 grounds, and particularly some spring or well of water. I was once
                                 travelling in the south in the beginning of October, when the
                                 season happened to be exceedingly hot, and the wells and rivulets
                                 of the country were all dried up. We had neither water, for
                                 ourselves, nor for our horses; and after having taken much
                                 fruitless trouble to obtain some, we went and paid homage to a
                                 Saint, who at first pretended a variety of scruples before he would
                                 suffer infidels to approach; but on promising to give him ten or 12
                                 shillings, he became exceedingly humane, and supplied us with as
                                 much water as we wanted; still however vaunting highly of his
                                 charity, and particularly of his disinterestedness.

                                 so much given to superstition as the <rs type="place" ref="Arabia"
                                    >Arabs</rs>, or even as the Mahometans in general. They hung
                                 about their children's necks the figure of an open hand, which the
                                 Turks and Moors paint upon their ships and houses, as an antidote
                                 and counter-charm to an evil eye: For five is with them an unlucky
                                 number and five (fingers perhaps) in your eyes, is their proverb of
                                 cursing and defiance. Those who are grown up, carry always about
                                 with them some paragraph or other of their Koran, which, like as
                                 the Jews did their phylacteries, they place upon their breast, or
                                 sow under their caps, to prevent fascination and witchcraft, and to
                                 secure themselves from sickness and misfortunes. The virtue of
                                 these charms and scrolls is supposed likewise to be so far
                                 universal, that they suspend them upon the necks of their cattle,
                                 horses and other beasts of burthen. <bibl>Shaw.</bibl>

                                 longer, he retires from the fray and conveys him to a place of
                                 security. If the rider falls upon the ground his horse remains
                                 beside him, and neighs till assistance is brought: the <hi

                                 each of which has its proper name. Some of these have a higher

                                 that displayed itself in a variety of extraordinary appearances.
                                 For it was sometimes globular, or like the flame of a candle;
                                 immediately after it would spread itself and involve our whole
                                 company in its pale inoffensive light, then at once contract itself
                                 and disappear. But in less than a minute it would again exert
                                 itself as at other times, or else, running along from one place to
                                 another with a swift progressive motion, would expand itself, at
                                 certain intervals over more than two or three acres of the adjacent
                                 mountains. The atmosphere from the beginning of the evening, had
                                 been remarkably thick and hazy, and the dew, as we felt it upon our
                                 bridles, was unusually clammy and unctuous. In the like disposition

                                 </ref> Meskouteen, we are to observe farther of them, that their
                                 water is of so intense a heat, that the rocky ground it runs over,
                                 to the distance sometimes of a hundred foot, is dissolved, or
                                 rather calcined by it. When the substance of these rocks is soft
                                 and uniform, then the water by making every way equal impressions,
                                 leaveth them in the shape of cones or hemispheres; which being six
                                 foot high and a little more or less of the same diameter, the Arabs
                                 maintain to be so many tents of their predecessors turned into
                                 stone. But when these rocks, besides their usual soft chalky
                                 substance, contain likewise some layers of harder matter, not so
                                 easy to be dissolved, then, in proportion to the resistance the
                                 water is thereby to meet with, we are entertained with a confusion
                                 of traces and channels, distinguished by the Arabs into Sheep,
                                 Camels, Horses, nay into Men, Women and Children, whom they suppose
                                 to have undergone the like fate with their habitations. I observed
                                 that the fountains which afforded this water, had been frequently
                                 stopped up: or rather ceasing to run at one place, broke out
                                 immediately in another, which circumstance seems not only to
                                 account for the number of cones, but for that variety likewise of
                                 traces, that are continued from one or other of these cones or
                                 fountains, quite down to the river Zenati. </p>
                              <p> This place, in riding over it, giveth back such a hollow sound,
                                 that we were afraid every moment of sinking thro' it. It is
                                 probable therefore that the ground below us was hollow: and may not
                                 the air then, which is pent up within these caverns, afford, as we

                                 time to time their companions visited them, with the most precious
                                 odours. These odours were the usual food of the Peris, and procured
                                 them also another advantage, for they prevented the Dives from
                                 approaching or molesting them. The Dives could not bear the
                                 perfumes, which rendered them gloomy and melancholy whenever they
                                 drew near the cage in which a Peri was suspended.

                              <p> The King and the great Lords have a sort of cellar for
                                 magnificence, where they sometimes drink with persons whom they
                                 wish to regale. These cellars are square rooms, to which you
                                 descend by only two or three steps. In the middle is a small
                                 cistern of water, and a rich carpet covers the ground from the
                                 walls to the cistern. At the four corners of the cistern are four
                                 large glass bottles, each containing about twenty quarts of wine,
                                 one white, another red. From one to the other of these, smaller
                                 bottles are ranged of the same material and form, that is, round
                                 with a long neck, holding about four or five quarts, white and red
                                 alternately. Round the cellar are several rows of niches in the
                                 wall, and in each nich is a bottle also of red and white
                                 alternately.—Some niches are made to hold two. Some windows give
                                 light to the apartment, and all these bottles so well ranged with
                                 their various colours have a very fine effect to the eye. They are
                                 always kept full, the wine preserving better, and therefore are
                                 replenished as fast as they are emptied. <bibl>Tavernier.</bibl>

                                 is thence transported, that in the summer it cools the water
                                 wonderfully and very suddenly, by reason of continual
                                 transpiration. So that they who desire to drink cool and
                                 deliciously, never drink in the same pot above five or six days at
                                 most. They wash it with rose water the first time, to take away the
                                 ill smell of the earth, and they hang it in the air full of water,
                                 wrapped up in a moist linen cloth. A fourth part of the water
                                 transpires in six hours the first time; after that still less from
                                 day to day, till at last the pores are closed up by the thick
                                 matter contained in the water which stops in the pores. But so soon
                                 as the pores are stopt, the water stinks in the pots, and you must
                                 take new ones. <bibl>Chardin.</bibl>

                                 and transported all over the kingdom. They also make the strongest

                                 are. This incomparable Grape grows only upon the young branches,
                                 which they never water. So that for five months together they grow
                                 in the heat of summer and under a scorching sun, without receiving
                                 a drop of water, either from the sky or otherwise. When the vintage
                                 is over, they let in their cattle to browze in the vineyards,
                                 afterwards they cut off all the great wood, and leave only the
                                 young stocks about three foot high, which need no propping up with
                                 poles as in other places, and therefore they never make use of any
                                 such supporters. <bibl>Chardin.</bibl>

                                 bridge is placed between two mountains separated only by the river,
                                 and supported by four arches, unequal both in their height and
                                 breadth. They are built after an irregular form, in regard of two
                                 great heaps of a rock that stand in the river, upon which they laid
                                 so many arches. Those at the two ends are hollowed on both sides
                                 and serve to lodge passengers, wherein they have made to that
                                 purpose little chambers and porticos, with every one a chimney. The
                                 Arch in the middle of the river is hollowed quite thro' from one
                                 part to the other with two chambers at the ends, and two large
                                 balconies covered, where they take the cool air in the summer with
                                 great delight, and to which there is a descent of two pair of
                                 stairs hewn out of the rock, there is not a fairer bridge in all

                              <p> The whole chapter <hi rend="italic">de montibus</hi> is written
                                 with the eloquence of a Poet. Indeed Gibbon bestowed no exaggerated
                                 praise on Burnet in saying that he had "blended scripture, history,
                                 and tradition into one magnificent system, with a sublimity of
                                 imagination scarcely inferior to Milton himself." This work should
                                 be read in Latin, the Author's own translation is miserably
                                 inferior. He lived in the worst age of English prose.</p>

                                    <placeName>Damascus</placeName> with many other Arabian women,
                                 she excited them to mutiny, they seized the poles of the tents and
                                 attacked their captors. This bold resolution, says Marigny, was not
                                 inspired by impotent anger. Most of these women had military
                                 inclinations already; particularly those who were of the tribe of
                                 Hemiar or of the Homerites, where they are early exercised in
                                 riding the horse, and in using the bow, the lance, and the javelin.
                                 The revolt was successful, for during the engagement Derar came up
                                 to their assistance. <bibl>Marigny.</bibl>

                                    potion being of force to cast him into such a slumber as should
                                    make him quite voide of all sense, and so being in a profound
                                    sleepe to convey him out of his paradise: who being awaked, and
                                    seeing himselfe thrust out of the paradise, would become so
                                    sorrowfull, that he could not in the world devise what to do, or
                                    whither to turne him. Then would he go unto the foresaide old
                                    man, beseeching him that he might be admitted againe into his
                                    paradise: who saith unto him, you cannot be admitted thither,
                                    unlesse you will slay such or such a man for my sake, and if you
                                    will give the attempt onely whether you kill him or no, I wil
                                    place you againe in paradise, that there you may remaine
                                    alwayes: then would the party without faile put the same in
                                    execution, indevouring to murther all those against whom the
                                    sayd olde man had conceived any hatred. And therefore all the
                                    kings of the east stood in awe of the sayd olde man, and gave
                                    unto him great tribute.</rs></p>

                                 destroyden all the faire places, and alle the nobletees of that
                                 Paradys. The place of the welles and of the walles and of many

                                 </persName>, naturally ill natured and quarrelsome, this is a

                                 in the fields, nobody knew how, or by whom. Two days after his

                                 in the town, it was noised about that he was seen to walk <time>in

                                 thousand other monkey tricks. At first the story was received with
                                 laughter; but the thing was looked upon to be serious when
                                    <orgName>the better sort of people</orgName> began to complain

                                 Several there present averr'd that the wretches blood was extremely

                                 warm, whence they concluded that <name type="zomb"> the

                                 have of <name type="zomb">Vroucolacas</name>. They then roar'd out
                                 that name in a stupendous manner. Just at this time came in
                                    <orgName>a flock of people</orgName> loudly protesting they
                                 plainly perceived the Body was not grown stiff when it was carried
                                 from the fields to Church to be buried, and that consequently it
                                 was a true <name type="zomb">Vroucolacas</name>; which word was
                                 still the burden of the song. </p>
                              <p> I don't doubt they would have sworn it did not stink, had not we
                                 been there; so mazed were <orgName>the poor people</orgName> with
                                 this disaster, and so infatuated with their <name type="zomb"
                                    >notion of the Dead being re-animated</name>. As for us, who
                                 were got as close to the corpse as we could, that
                                    <orgName>we</orgName> might be more exact in our observations,
                                 we were almost poisoned with the intolerable stink that issued from
                                 it. When they asked us what we thought of this body, we told them
                                 we believed it to be very thoroughly dead: but as we were willing
                                 to cure, or at least not to exasperate their prejudiced
                                 imaginations, we represented to them, that it was no wonder the
                                    <persName>butcher</persName> should feel a little warmth when he
                                 groped among Entrails that were then rotting, that it was no
                                 extraordinary thing for it to emit fumes, since dung turned up will
                                 do the same; that as for the pretended redness of the blood, it
                                 still appeared by the butcher's hands to be nothing but a very
                                 stinking nasty smear. </p>
                              <p> After all our reasons they were of opinion it would be <rs

                                 furiously than ever; he was accused of beating folks in the night,
                                 breaking down doors, and even roofs of houses, clattering windows,

                                    Missionary</bibl>. He was a <orgName>Latin</orgName>, say they,
                                 and consequently you ought to give him credit. We should have got
                                 nothing by denying the justness of the consequence: it was as good
                                 as a Comedy to us every morning to hear the new follies committed
                                 by <name type="zomb">this night bird</name>; they charged him with
                                 being guilty of the most abominable sins. </p>

                                 </orgName>, fancied they had been deficient in the most material
                                 part of the ceremony. <rs type="script" subtype="holy">They were of
                                    opinion that they had been wrong in saying mass before they had
                                    pulled out the wretches heart: had we taken this precaution,
                                    quoth they, we had bit <name type="zomb">the Devil</name>as sure
                                    as a gun; he would have been hanged before he would ever have
                                    come there again: whereas saying mass first, <name type="zomb"

                              <p> We so often repeated it to the <orgName>Magistrates</orgName> of

                                 say with a voice of authority, that <rs type="science"

                                    <orgName>all the inhabitants</orgName> were in a strange
                                 consternation; they knew not now what <name type="divin"

                                 thro' the city, that it was intolerable to wait any longer; that
                                 the only way left was to burn the <name type="zomb"
                                    >Vroucolacas</name> intire; that after so doing, let <name

                                    <geogFeat>the island</geogFeat> totally deserted, and indeed
                                 whole families began to pack up, in order to retire to

                                    of itself. What they had before left of this miserable carcass

                                       for our cattle: rosemary bushes, and other shrubs of uncommon
                                       fragance, which, being natives of the desert, are still
                                       perhaps without a name. Though these scented plants are the
                                       usual food of the camel, it is remarkable that his breath is
                                       insufferably nauseous. But when he is pushed by hunger, he
                                       devours thistles and prickles indiscriminately, without the
                                       least damage to his mouth, which seems proof to the sharpest

                                 <p> The hawk is used at <placeName>Aleppo</placeName> in taking the
                                    hare. "As soon as the hare is put up, one, or a brace of the
                                    nearest greyhounds are slipped, and <persName>the
                                       Falconer</persName> galloping after them, throws off his
                                    hawk. The hare cannot run long where the hawk behaves properly,
                                    but sometimes getting the start of the dogs, she gains the next
                                    hill and escapes. It now and then happens when the hawk is
                                    fierce and voracious in an unusual degree, that the hare is
                                    struck dead at the first stroke, but that is very uncommon; for
                                    the hawks preferred for hare hunting are taught to pounce and
                                    buffet the game, not to seize it, and they rise a little between
                                    each attack, to descend again with fresh force. In this manner
                                    the game is confused and retarded, till the greyhounds come in.

                                    </orgName> to bear witness to the truth of what I am going to
                                    relate, I should hardly venture to assert that with this bird,
                                    which is about the size of a pigeon, they sometimes take large
                                    Eagles. The Hawk in former times was taught to seize the Eagle
                                    under his pinion, and thus depriving him of the use of one wing,
                                    both birds fell to the ground together: but I am informed the
                                    present mode is to teach the Hawk to fix on the back between the
                                    wings, which has the same effect, only that the bird tumbling
                                    down more slowly, the Falconer has more time to come in to his
                                    Hawk's assistance; but in either case, if he be not very
                                    expeditious, the Falcon is inevitably destroyed. </p>
                                 <p>
                                    <persName>Dr. Patrick Russell</persName> says, this sport was
                                    disused in his time, probably from its ending more frequently in
                                    the death of the Falcon than of the Eagle. But he had often seen
                                    the Shaheen take Herons and Storks. "The hawk when thrown off
                                    flies for some time in a horizontal line not six feet from the
                                    ground, then mounting perpendicularly with astonishing
                                    swiftness, he seizes his prey under the wing, and both together
                                    come tumbling to the ground. If the Falconer is not expeditious
                                    the game soon disengages itself. </p>

                                    <orgName>We</orgName> saw about twenty antelopes, which,
                                    however, were so very shy, that we could not get near enough to
                                    have a shot, nor do I think it possible to take them without
                                    hawks, the mode usually practised in those countries. The
                                    swiftest greyhounds would be of no use, for the antelopes are
                                    much swifter of foot than any animal I ever saw before.

                                    They take the whole skin of a stag, of the head, body, and legs,
                                    and stuff it with straw to the shape of the animal. After fixing
                                    it in the place where they usually train the bird, they place
                                    his food upon the head of the stuffed stag, and chiefly in the
                                    two cavities of the eyes, that the Bird may strike there. Having
                                    accustomed him for several days to eat in this manner, they
                                    fasten the feet of the stag to a plank which runs upon wheels,
                                    which is drawn by cords from a distance; and from day to day
                                    they draw it faster, insensibly to accustom the Bird not to quit

                                    speed. They do the same with the wild boar, the ass, the fox,
                                    the hare, and other beasts of chase.—They are even taught to

                                    in this enterprize he makes use of this stratagem; he soaks his
                                    wings in water, and then covers them with sand and gravel, with
                                    which he flies against the deer's face, and blinds him for a
                                    time; the pain of this sets him running about like a distracted
                                    creature, and frequently he tumbles down a rock or some steep
                                    place, and breaks his neck; thus he becomes a prey to the eagle.

                                    very gentle and tame. A horseman carries it, and on perceiving
                                    the Gazelle lets it loose: and tho' the Gazelle is incredibly
                                    swift, it is so nimble that in three bounds it leaps upon the
                                    neck of its prey. The Gazelle is a sort of small antelope, of
                                    which the country is full. The Ounce immediately strangles it
                                    with its sharp talons, but if unluckily it misses its blow and
                                    the Gazelle escapes, it remains upon the spot ashamed and
                                    confused, and at that moment a child might take or kill it

                                    wild boars, he had them all dressed and eat the same day, and

                                       The way nature has found to produce it, to us appears strange
                                       enough. There is in this province a creature, or insect of
                                       the bigness of a flea, so sharp at stinging, that it not only
                                       pierces the skins of men and beasts, but the boughs and
                                       bodies of the trees. Those of the province of
                                          <placeName>Xantung</placeName> are much valued; where the
                                       inhabitants gather their eggs from the trees, and carry them
                                       to sell in the province of <placeName>Huquam</placeName>. In
                                       the spring, there come from these eggs certain worms, which
                                       about the beginning of the summer they place at the foot of
                                       the tree, whence they creep up, spreading themselves
                                       wonderfully over all the branches. Having placed themselves
                                       there, they gnaw, pierce, and bore to the very pith, and
                                       their nourishment they convert into wax as white as snow,
                                       which they drive out to the mouth of the hole they have made,
                                       where it remains congealed in drops by the wind, and cold.
                                       Then the owners of the trees gather it, and make it into
                                       cakes as we do, which are sold about

                                 because they consider them as the sacred inhabitants of the balsam.

                                    and heroic compassion for her who had given him birth, prayed
                                    his protector to leave him with the Barbarian, and carry to his
                                    mother the money which on that account he would receive: So that

                                    the feet. The first master of the red-headed boy was greatly
                                    surprized at the sight and still more so when he heard that the
                                    boy had been beaten upon the belly for six hours, by slaves who
                                    relieved one another, till he died: and that a poison was made
                                    of the last foam that came from his mouth, so penetrating, that
                                    if the stirrup of a horse were touched with the point of a pin

                                    which by our people is called Gekko, from its constant cry,
                                    (like among us that of the Cuckoe) is properly an Indian
                                    Salamander. It is about a foot long, its skin of of a pale or
                                    sea green colour, with red spots. The head is not unlike that of
                                    a tortoise, with a streight mouth. The eyes are very large,
                                    starting out of the head, with long and small eye-apples. The
                                    tail is distinguished by several white rings; its teeth are so
                                    sharp as to make an impression even upon steel. Each of its four
                                    legs had five crooked claws aimed on the end with nails. Its
                                    gait is very slow, but wherever it fastens it is not easily
                                    removed. It dwells commonly upon rotten trees, or among the

                                    and <rs type="building" subtype="temple">churches</rs>; it
                                    oftentimes settles near the bedsteads, which makes sometimes the
                                       <orgName>moors</orgName> pull down their huts. </p>
                                 <p> Its constant cry is <hi rend="italic">gekko</hi>, but before it
                                    begins it makes a kind of hissing noise. The sting of this
                                    creature is so venomous, that the wound proves mortal, unless it
                                    be immediately burnt with a red hot iron, or cut off. The blood
                                    is of a palish colour, resembling poison itself. </p>
                                 <p> The <orgName>Javanese</orgName> use to dip their arrows in the

                                    them, (an art much esteemed in the <geogFeat>island</geogFeat>
                                    of <placeName>Java</placeName>, by both sexes) hang it up with a
                                    string tied to the tail on the cieling, by which means it being
                                    exasperated to the highest pitch sends forth a yellow liquor out
                                    of its mouth, which they gather in small pots set underneath,
                                    and afterwards coagulate into a body in the sun. This they
                                    continue for several months together, by giving daily food to
                                    the creature. It is unquestionably the strongest poison in

                              <p> The fiction of the Upas is too well known from the Botanic Garden,
                                 to need repetition. Suffice it here to remark that the Tree is said
                                 to have sprung up as a punishment to the guilty Islanders. </p>
                              <p> None of our early travellers mention this Tree, and they were too
                                 fond of wonders to omit so monstrous a tale, had it been true. It
                                 is curious that such a story should have been invented by a
                                 Dutchman. </p>
                              <p> Perhaps the seed of the Upas is contained in the following
                                 passage. </p>
                              <p> Neere unto the said Iland (Java) is another countrey called
                                 Panten, or Tathalamasin. In this land there are trees yeelding
                                 meale, hony and wine, and the most deadly poison in all <placeName

                                 there is but one onley remedy; and that is this; if a man hath
                                 taken of the poyson, and would be delivered from the danger
                                 thereof, let him temper the dung of aman in water, and so drinke a
                                 good quantity thereof and it expels the poyson immediately.

                              <p> When any person is to be buried, it is usual to bring the corpse
                                 at mid-day or afternoon prayers, to one or other of these Mosques,
                                 from whence it is accompanied by the greatest part of the
                                 congregation, <rs type="metaplace" subtype="under" ref="Tombs">to
                                    the grave</rs>. Their processions, at these times, are not so
                                 slow and solemn as in most parts of
                                    <placeName>Christendom</placeName>: for the whole company make
                                 what haste they can, singing as they go along, some select verses
                                 of their Coran. That absolute submission which they pay to the will
                                 of God, allows them not to use any consolatory words upon these
                                 occasions: no loss or misfortune is to be hereupon regretted or
                                 complained of: instead likewise of such expressions of sorrow and
                                 condolence, as may regard the deceased, the compliments turn upon
                                 the person, who is the nearest concerned, a blessing (say his
                                 friends) be upon your head. <bibl>Shaw.</bibl>

                              <p> All Mahometans inter the dead at the hour set apart for prayer;
                                 the defunct is not kept in the house, except he expires after
                                 sunset, but the Body is transported to the Mosque, whither it is
                                 carried by those who are going to prayer; each from a spirit of
                                 devotion is desirous to carry in his turn. Women regularly go on
                                 Friday to weep over, and pray <rs type="metaplace" subtype="under"
                                    ref="Tombs">at the sepulchres of the dead</rs>, whose memory

                              <p> This custom of crowding about a funeral contributes to spread the
                                 plague in <placeName>Turkey</placeName>.—It is not many years
                                 since, in some parts of Worcestershire, the mourners were
                                 accustomed to kneel with their heads upon the coffin during the
                                 burial service. </p>
                              <p> The fullest account of a Mohammedan funeral is in the Lettres sur
                                 la Grece, of M. Guys. Chance made him the spectator of a ceremony
                                 which the Moslem will not suffer an Infidel to prophane by his
                                 presence. </p>
                              <p> "About ten in the morning I saw the grave-digger at work; the
                                 slaves and the women of the family were seated in the burial
                                 ground, many other women arrived, and then they all began to
                                 lament. After this prelude they one after the other embraced one of
                                 the little pillars which are placed upon the graves, crying out <hi
                                    rend="italic">Ogloum, ogloum, sœna Mussaphir gueldi</hi>, My
                                 Son, my Son, a guest is coming to see thee. At these words their
                                 tears and sobs began anew; but the storm did not continue long;
                                 they all seated themselves, and entered into conversation. </p>
                              <p> At noon I heard a confused noise, and cries of lamentation, it was
                                 the funeral which arrived. A Turk preceded it, bearing upon his
                                 head a small chest; four other Turks carried the bier upon their
                                 shoulders, then came the father, the relations and the friends of
                                 the dead in great numbers. Their cries ceased at the entrance of
                                 the burial ground, but then they quarrelled—and for this. The man
                                 who bore the chest opened it, it was filled with copies of the
                                 Koran, a croud of Turks, young and old, threw themselves upon the
                                 books and scrambled for them. Those who succeeded ranged themselves
                                 around the Iman, and all at once began to recite the Koran, almost
                                 as Boys say their lesson. Each of the readers received ten parats,
                                 about fifteen sols, wrapt in paper. It was then for these fifteen
                                 pence that these pious assistants had quarrelled, and in our own
                                 country you might have seen them fight for less. </p>
                              <p> The bier was placed by the grave, in which the grave-digger was
                                 still working, and perfumes were burnt by it. After the reading of
                                 the Koran the Iman chanted some Arabic prayers, and his full-chant
                                 would, no doubt, have appeared to you, as it did to me, very
                                 ridiculous. All the Turks were standing; they held their hands open
                                 over the grave, and answered <hi rend="italic">Amen</hi> to all the
                                 prayers which the Iman addressed to<name type="divin">God</name>for
                                 the deceased. </p>
                              <p> The prayers finished, a large chest was brought about six feet
                                 long and three broad; its boards were very thick. The coffin is
                                 usually made of cypress; thus literally is verified the phrase of <bibl>
                                    <author>Horace</author>
                                 </bibl> that the cypress is our last possession. </p>

                                 after having recited the <hi rend="italic">Fatka</hi> (a prayer
                                 very similar to our Lord's prayer, which is repeated by all
                                 present) the Iman asks the congregation what they have to testify
                                 concerning the life and morals of the deceased. Each then in his
                                 turn relates those good actions with which he was acquainted. The
                                 body is then washed, and wrapped up like a mummy, so that it cannot
                                 be seen. Drugs and spices are placed in the bier with it, and it is
                                 carried to interment. Before it is lowered into the grave, the Iman
                                 commands silence, saying, "Cease your lamentations for a moment,
                                 and let me instruct this Moslem how to act, when he arrives in <rs
                                    type="metaplace" subtype="divin" ref="the_other_world">the other
                                    world</rs>." Then in the ear of the corpse, he directs him how
                                 to answer the Evil Spirit who will not fail to question him
                                 respecting his religion, &amp;c. This lesson finished, he repeats
                                 the <hi rend="italic">Fatka</hi> with all the assistants, and the
                                 body is let down into the grave. After they have thrown earth three
                                 times upon the grave, as the Romans used, they retire. The Iman
                                 only remains, he approaches the grave, stoops down, inclines his
                                 ear, and listens to hear if the Dead disputes when the Angel of
                                 Death comes to take him: then he bids him farewell, and in order to
                                 be well paid, never fails to report to the family the best news of
                                 the dead.</p>

                              <p> An Abyssinian historian says, that the village, called

                                    rain</hi>, has its name from an extraordinary circumstance that
                                 once happened in these parts, for a shower of rain fell, which was
                                 not properly of the nature of rain, as it did not run upon the
                                 ground, but remained very light, having scarce the weight of
                                 feathers, of a beautiful white colour like flower; it fell in
                                 showers, and occasioned a darkness in the air more than rain, and
                                 liker to mist. It covered the face of the whole country for several
                                 days, retaining its whiteness the whole time, then went away like
                                 dew, without leaving any smell, or unwholsome effect behind it. </p>

                              <p> A strange account of the Cedars of <placeName>Lebanon</placeName>
                                 is given by <bibl>De la Roque. <hi rend="italic">Voyage de Syrie
                                       &amp; du Mont Liban.</hi> 1722</bibl>. </p>
                              <p> "This little forest is composed of twenty Cedars of a prodigious
                                 size, so large indeed that the finest Planes, Sycamores, and other
                                 large trees which we had seen could not be compared with them.
                                 Besides these principal Cedars, there were a great number of lesser
                                 ones, and some very small, mingled with the large trees, or in
                                 little clumps near them. They differed not in their foliage, which
                                 resembles the Juniper, and is green throughout the year: but the
                                 great Cedars spread at their summit and form a perfect round,
                                 whereas the small ones rise in a pyramidal form like the Cypress.
                                 Both diffuse the same pleasant odour; the large ones only yield
                                 fruit, a large cone in shape almost like that of the Pine, but of a
                                 browner colour, and compacter shell. It gives a very pleasant
                                 odour, and contains a sort of thick and transparent balm, which
                                 oozes out thro' small apertures, and falls drop by drop. This fruit
                                 which it is difficult to separate from the stalk, contains a nut
                                 like that of the Cypress; it grows at the end of the boughs, and
                                 turns its point upwards. </p>
                              <p> The nature of this tree is not to elevate its trunk, or the part
                                 between the root and the first branches; for the largest Cedars
                                 which we saw did not in the height of their trunks exceed six or
                                 seven feet. From this low but enormously thick body, prodigious
                                 branches rise, spreading as they rise, and forming by the
                                 disposition of their boughs and leaves which point upward, a sort
                                 of wheel which appears to be the work of art. The bark of the
                                 cedar, except at the trunk, is smooth and shining, of a brown
                                 colour. Its wood white and soft immediately under the bark, but
                                 hard and red within, and very bitter, which renders it
                                 incorruptible and almost immortal. A fragrant gum issues from the
                                 tree. </p>
                              <p> The largest Cedar which we measured was seven feet in
                                 circumference, wanting two inches, and the whole extent of its
                                 branches, which it was easy to measure from their perfect
                                 roundness, formed a circumference of about 120 feet. </p>
                              <p> The Patriarch of the Maronites, fully persuaded of the rarity of
                                 these Trees, and wishing by the preservation of those that remain
                                 to shew his respect for a forest so celebrated in Scripture has
                                 pronounced canonical pains, and even excommunication against any
                                 Christians who shall dare to cut them; scarcely will he permit a
                                 little to be sometimes taken for Crucifixes and little tabernacles
                                 in the chapels of our Missionaries. </p>
                              <p> The Maronites themselves have such a veneration for these Cedars,
                                 that on the day of Transfiguration they celebrate the festival
                                 under them with great solemnity, the Patriarch officiates and says
                                 Mass pontifically, and among other exercises of devotion they
                                 particularly honour the Virgin Mary there, and sing her praises,
                                 because she is compared to the Cedars of
                                    <placeName>Lebanon</placeName>, and Lebanon itself used as a
                                 metaphor for the mother of Christ. </p>
                              <p> The Maronites say that the snows have no sooner begun to fall than
                                 these Cedars, whose boughs in their infinite number are all so
                                 equal in height that they appear to have been shorn, and form, as
                                 we have said, a sort of wheel or parasol,—than these Cedars, I say,
                                 never fail at that time to change their figure. The branches which
                                 before spread themselves rise insensibly, gathering together it may
                                 be said, and turn their points upward towards Heaven, forming
                                 altogether a pyramid. It is <name type="myth">Nature</name>, they
                                 say, who inspires this movement, and makes them assume a new shape,
                                 without which these Trees never could sustain the immense weight of
                                 snow, remaining for so long a time. </p>
                              <p> I have procured more particular information of this fact, and it
                                 has been confirmed by the testimony of many persons, who have often
                                 witnessed it. This is what the Secretary of the Maronite Patriarch
                                 wrote to me in one of his letters, which I think it right to give
                                 in his own words. <hi rend="italic">Cedri Libani quas plantavit

                              <p> The Cedars of <placeName>Lebanon</placeName>, which, as the
                                 Psalmist says, God himself planted, are situated in a little plain,
                                 somewhat below the loftiest summit of mount Lebanon, where in the
                                 winter a great quantity of snow falls, and continues for three
                                 months, or longer. The Cedars are high, but their boughs spread out
                                 parallel with the ground into a circle, forming almost a shield
                                 against the sun. But when the snow falls, which would be heaped
                                 upon them in so great a quantity, that they could not endure such a
                                 weight so long a time, without the certain danger of breaking,
                                    <name type="myth">Nature, the provident mother of all</name>,
                                 has endued them with power, that when the winter comes and the snow
                                 descends, their boughs immediately rise, and uniting together form
                                 a cone, that they may be the better defended from the coming Enemy.

                                    <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, and which is in colour like
                                 ordinary wheat, and in taste like Turkish wheat, and is of the

                                 pan without any liquor, beat it to powder, and boyling it with fair
                                 water, they make this drink thereof, which hath as it were the
                                 taste of a burnt crust, and is not pleasant to the palate. <bibl>

                              <p> It is well known how much the Orientalists are addicted to this
                                 pretended science. There is a curious instance of public folly in
                                 Sir John Chardin's travels. </p>
                              <p> "Sephie-Mirza was born in the year of the <hi rend="italic"
                                    >Egire</hi> 1057. for the superstition <rs type="place"
                                    ref="Persia">of the Persians</rs> will not let us know the month
                                 or the day. Their addiction to Astrology is such that they
                                 carefully conceal the moments of their Princes birth, to prevent
                                 the casting their nativities, where they might meet perhaps with
                                 something which they should be unwilling to know." </p>
                              <p> At the coronation of this Prince two Astrologers were to be
                                 present, with an Astrolabe in their hands, to take the fortunate
                                 hour, as they term it, and observe the lucky moments that a happy
                                 constellation should point out for proceedings of that importance. </p>
                              <p> Sephie-Mirza having by debauchery materially injured his health,
                                 the Chief Physician was greatly alarmed, "in regard his life
                                 depended upon the King's, or if his life were spared yet he was
                                 sure to lose his estate and his liberty, as happens to all those
                                 who attend the Asiatic Sovereigns, when they die under their care.
                                 The Queen Mother too accused him of treason or ignorance, believing
                                 that since he was her Son's Physician he was obliged to cure him.
                                 This made the Physician at his wits end, so that all his receipts
                                 failing him, he bethought himself of one that was peculiarly his
                                 own invention, and which few physicians would ever have found out,
                                 as not being to be met with neither in Galen nor Hippocrates. What
                                 does he then do, but out of an extraordinary fetch of his wit, he
                                 begins to lay the fault upon the stars and the King's Astrologers,
                                 crying out that they were altogether in the wrong, that if the King
                                 lay in a languishing condition and could not recover his health it
                                 was because they had failed to observe the happy hour, or the
                                 Aspect of a fortunate constellation at the time of his coronation."
                                 The stratagem succeeded, the King was recrowned and by the new name
                                 of Solyman! <bibl>Chardin.</bibl>

                                 mark'd with the characters of the same signs and planets, and their
                                 several and necessary aspects. The same method he observed in the
                                 head, neck, shoulders, thighs, and legs, all which were fashioned
                                 at several times, and being put and fastened together in the form
                                 of a man, had the faculty to reveal to the said Albertus the
                                 solutions of all his principal difficulties. To which they add
                                 (that nothing be lost of the story of the statue) that it was
                                 battered to pieces by St. Thomas, meerely because he could not
                                 endure its excesse of prating. </p>
                              <p> But to give a more rational account of this Androides of Albertus,
                                 as also of all these miraculous heads, I conceive the original of
                                 this fable may well be deduced from the Teraph of the Hebrews, by
                                 which as Mr. Selden affirms, many are of opinion, that we must
                                 understand what is said in Genesis concerning Laban's Gods, and in
                                 the first book of Kings concerning the image which Michol put into
                                 the bed in David's place. For R. Eleazar holds that it was made of
                                 the head of a male child, the first born and that dead-born, under
                                 whose tongue they applyed a lamen of Gold, whereon were engraved
                                 the characters and inscriptions of certain planets, which the Jews
                                 superstitiously wandered up and down with, instead of the Urim and
                                 Thummim, or the Ephod of the High Priest. And that this original is
                                 true and well deduced, there is a manifest indicium, in that Henry
                                 D'Assia, and Bartholomæus Sibillus affirm, that the Androides of
                                 Albertus, and the Head made by Virgil, were composed of flesh and
                                 bone, yet not by nature, but by art. But this being judged
                                 impossible by modern Authors, and the vertue of Images, Annulets,
                                 and planetary Sigills being in great reputation, men have thought
                                 ever since (taking their opinion from Trismegistus affirming in his
                                 Asclepion, that of the Gods, some were made by the Sovereign God,
                                 and others by men, who, by some art, had the power to unite the
                                 invisible Spirits to things visible and corporeal, as is explained
                                 at large by St. Augustine) that such figures were made of copper or
                                 some other metal, whereon men had wrought under some favourable
                                 Aspects of Heaven and the planets. </p>
                              <p> My design is not absolutely to deny that he might compose some
                                 head or statue of man, like that of Memnon, from which proceeded a
                                 small sound and pleasant noise, when the rising Sun came by his
                                 heat to rarify and force out, by certain small conduits, the air
                                 which in the cold of the night was condensed within it. Or haply
                                 they might be like those statues of Boetius, whereof Cassiodorus
                                 speaking said, <hi rend="italic">Metalla mugiunt</hi>, <hi

                              <p> The Balance of the Dead is an article in almost every creed.
                                 Mohammed borrowed it from the Persians. I know not from whence the
                                 Monks introduced it; probably they were ignorant enough to have
                                 invented the obvious fiction. </p>
                              <p> In the Vision of Thurcillus the ceremony is accurately described.
                                    <q>"At the end of the north wall, within the church, sate St.
                                    Paul, and opposite him, without, was <name type="divin">the
                                       Devil</name>and his Angels. At the feet of <name type="divin"
                                       >the Devil</name>a burning pit flamed up, which was the mouth
                                    of the Pit of Hell. A Balance equally poised, was fixed upon the
                                    wall between <name type="divin">the Devil</name>and the Apostle,
                                    one scale hanging before each. The Apostle had two weights, a
                                    greater and a less, all shining and like gold, and <name
                                       type="divin">the Devil</name>also had two smoky and black
                                    ones. Therefore the Souls that were all black came one after
                                    another, with great fear and trembling, to behold the weighing
                                    of their good and evil works: for these weights weighed the
                                    works of all the souls, according to the good or evil which they
                                    had done. When the scale inclined to the Apostle, he took the
                                    Soul, and introduced it thro' the Eastern gate, into the fire of
                                    Purgatory, that there it might expiate its crimes. But when the
                                    scale inclined and sunk towards the Devil, then he and his
                                    Angels snatched the soul miserably howling and cursing the
                                    father and mother that begot it to eternal torments, and cast it
                                    with laughter and grinning into the deep and fiery pit which was
                                    at the feet of <name type="divin">the Devil</name>. Of this
                                    Balance of good and evil much may be found in the writings of
                                    the holy Fathers." <bibl>

                                 <p> "Concerning the salvation of Charlemagne, Archbishop Turpin, a
                                    man of holy life, wrote thus. "I, Turpin, Archbishop of Rheims,
                                    being in my chamber, in the city of Vienna, saying my prayers,
                                    saw a legion of Devils in the air, who were making a great
                                    noise. I adjured one of them to tell me from whence they came,
                                    and wherefore they made so great an uproar. And he replied that
                                    they came from <placeName>Aix la Chapelle</placeName>, where a
                                    great Lord had died, and that they were returning in anger
                                    because they had not been able to carry away his soul. I asked
                                    him who the great Lord was, and why they had not been able to
                                    carry away his soul. He replied that it was Charlemagne, and
                                    that Saint Jago had been greatly against them. And I asked him
                                    how St. Jago had been against them; and he replied, we were
                                    weighing the good and the evil which he had done <placeName
                                       ref="the_world">in this world</placeName>, and Saint Jago
                                    brought so much timber and so many stones from the churches
                                    which he had founded in his name, that they greatly
                                    over-balanced all his evil works; and so we had no power over
                                    his soul. And having said this <name type="divin">the
                                       Devil</name>disappeared." </p>

                              <p> We must understand from this vision of Archbishop Turpin, that

                                 invented to conciliate the Pagan Arabs, who believed, that of the

                                 which once in a hundred years visited <rs type="metaplace"

                              <p> To this there is an allusion in the Moallakat. "Then I knew with

                                 blow would make the Perched Birds of the Brain fly quickly from

                                 allude to the same superstition, or perhaps are merely
                                 metaphorical, in the usual stile of its true Oriental bombast.

                                    Jorge</rs>, the Maronite Martyr, was visited by two strange
                                 Birds of unusual size. No one knew whence they came. They emblemed,
                                 says Vasconcellos, the purity and the indefatigable activity of his
                                 soul. </p>
                              <p> The inhabitants of <placeName>Otaheite</placeName> have assigned a
                                 less respectable part of the Body, as the Seat of the Soul. </p>
                              <p> The disembowelling of the body there, is always performed in great
                                 secrecy, and with much religious superstition. The bowels are, by
                                 these people, considered as the immediate organs of sensation,
                                 where the first impressions are received, and by which all the
                                 operations of the mind are carried on: it is therefore natural to
                                 conclude, that they may esteem, and venerate the intestines, as
                                 bearing the greatest affinity to the immortal part. I have
                                 frequently held conversations on this subject, with a view to
                                 convince them, that all intellectual operations were carried on in
                                 the head; at which they would generally smile, and intimate, that
                                 they had frequently seen men recover whose skulls had been
                                 fractured, and whose heads had otherways been much injured; but
                                 that, in all cases in which the intestines had been wounded, the
                                 persons on a certainty died. Other arguments they would also
                                 advance in favour of their belief; such as the effect of fear, and
                                 other passions, which caused great agitation and uneasiness, and
                                 would sometimes produce sickness at the stomach, which they
                                 attributed intirely to the action of the bowels.

                              <p> When Hosein the son of Ali was sick of a grievous disorder, he
                                 longed for a pomegranate, tho' that fruit was not then in season.
                                 Ali went out, and diligently enquiring found a single one in the
                                 possession of a Jew. As he returned with it, a sick man met him and
                                 begged half the pomegranate, saying it would restore his health.
                                 Ali gave him half, and when he had eaten it, the man requested he
                                 would give him the other half, the sooner to complete his recovery.
                                 Ali benignantly complied, returned to his son and told him what had
                                 happened, and Hosein approved what his father had done. </p>
                              <p> Immediately behold a miracle! as they were talking together the
                                 door was gently knocked at. He ordered the woman servant to go
                                 there, and she found a man, of all men the most beautiful, who had
                                 a plate in his hand covered with green silk, in which were ten
                                 pomegranates. The woman was astonished at the beauty of the man and
                                 of the pomegranates, and she took one of them and hid it, and
                                 carried the other nine to Aly, who kissed the present. When he had
                                 counted them he found that one was wanting, and said so to the
                                 servant, she confessed that she had taken it on account of its
                                 excellence, and Ali gave her her liberty. The Pomegranates were
                                 from <rs type="metaplace" subtype="divin">Paradise</rs>, Hosein was
                                 cured of his disease only by their odour, and rose up immediately,

                              <p> I suspect, says Maracci, that this is a true miracle wrought by
                                 some Christian Saint, and falsely attributed to Ali. However this
                                 may be, it does not appear absurd that<name type="divin"
                                 >God</name>should by some especial favour reward an act of
                                 remarkable charity even in an Infidel, as he has sometimes by a
                                 striking chastisement punished enormous crimes. But the assertion
                                 that the Pomegranates were sent from <rs type="metaplace"
                                    subtype="divin">Paradise</rs>, exposes the fable. </p>
                              <p> Maracci after detailing and ridiculing the Mohammedan miracles,
                                 contrasts with them in an appendix a few of the real and permanent
                                 miracles of Christianity which are proved by the testimony of

                                 selects five as examples. 1. The Chapel of Loretto, brought by
